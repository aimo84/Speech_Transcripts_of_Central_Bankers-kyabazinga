Has Japan's Economy Changed?: 
Challenges and Prospects 
Speech at the Japan Society in New York 
(New York, October 3) 
Masazumi Wakatabe 
Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan 
Introduction 
It  is  a  great  honor to have  the opportunity  to  speak  to  you  here  at the  distinguished  Japan 
Society. 
 Has  Japan's  economy  changed?  My  answer  is  both  yes  and  no.  The  economy  has  been 
changing  in  a  positive  manner,  but  the  change  is  far  from  over.  I  would  like  to  talk  about 
changes in Japan's economy and its challenges from a somewhat longer-term perspective. 
 "Because Japan has experienced decades-long stagnation, today's society is a very difficult 
place  to  live  for  you."  This  comes  from  a  children's  educational  comic  book  published  in 
August  2013.1  This  phrase  reflects  the  general  mood  back  then,  when  the  economy  was 
under prolonged stagnation. 
 About 30 years have passed since the early 1990s, when the asset price bubble collapsed in 
Japan. Looking back, this 30-year period can be roughly divided into three separate decades. 
In  the  first  decade,  aggregate  demand  fell  after  the  collapse  of  the  bubble  economy,  the 
so-called  "three  excesses"  of  corporate  debt,  production  capacity,  and  employment 
materialized,  and  attention  was  drawn  to  the  nonperforming  loan  problem  of  financial 
institutions.  In  the  following  decade,  although  the  disposal  of  nonperforming  loans 
proceeded  on  course,  the  economic  growth  rate  remained  low.  Also,  deflation  became  a 
problem, with the annual CPI inflation rate staying in negative territory. These two decades 
are sometimes called Japan's "lost two decades." And the last decade is the period from the 
early 2010s up to the present.   
 As there has been lively discussion on why Japan's economy remained stagnant for such a 
long time as the "lost two decades" after the collapse of the bubble economy, I will not go 
into detail.2  Instead, as an introduction, I would like to discuss Japan's declining and aging

population,  which  is  considered  to  be  not  only  one  of  the  factors  behind  the  "lost  two 
decades"  but  also  highly  likely  to  continue.  Japan's  economy  has  faced  the  structural 
problem of a decline in working-age population since the  mid-1990s. The total population 
started  to  decline  in  the  2010s,  but  the  working-age  population  aged  15-64,  which  is  the 
major source of labor supply, already began to decrease in the mid-1990s (Chart 1). In other 
words, since the mid-1990s, Japan has remained in a period of so-called demographic onus, 
where the working-age population declines at a faster pace than that of the total population. 
This  stands  in  contrast  to  the  United  States,  where  both  the  total  population  and  the 
working-age  population  have  continued  to  increase  consistently.  The  decline  in  the 
working-age  population  has  been  pointed  to  as  one  of  the  reasons  behind  the  stagnant 
economic  activity  in  Japan's  "lost  two  decades."  In  fact,  when  we  decompose  Japan's 
potential growth rate into the number of employed persons, hours worked, capital stock, and 
total  factor  productivity  (TFP),  we  can  find  that  the  number  of  employed  persons 
contributed negatively from the late 1990s through the late 2000s (Chart 2).3  The decline in 
the working-age population is considered to lie behind this development. 
 That said, I believe the negative effects on the economy of a declining and aging population 
have been rather exaggerated. First of all, as Chart 2 shows, the contribution of the number 
of  employed  persons  is  not  so  significant;  capital  stock  and  TFP  contribute  more  to  the 
potential  growth  rate.  Historically  speaking,  throughout  the post-WWII  era, an  increase  in 
capital  stock  and  TFP  has  contributed  more  than  a  change  in  labor  input  to  a  rise  in  the 
economic  growth  rate.  Also,  international  comparisons  show  no  evidence  that  a  declining 
and aging population  leads to a decline in per capita growth rate.4  In addition, there are a 
number  of  transmission  mechanisms  through  which  a  declining  and  aging  population  can 
affect  the  economy  (Chart  3).  Admittedly,  a  decline  in  the  working-age  population  could 
exert  downward  pressure  on  economic  growth,  since  the  labor  supply  will  decrease. 
                                                   
3  The potential growth rate here and the output gap, which will be discussed later in the speech, are 
based on estimates made by the Bank of Japan. The estimation results should be interpreted with a 
certain latitude. 
4  Using OECD data from 1970 through 2011, one study shows that there is no correlation between 
per capita GDP growth rate and  population  growth rate. See Hatta  Tatsuo  and Nippon Institute for 
Research  Advancement,  eds.,  Chihō  sōsei  no  tame  no  kōzō  kaikaku:  Dokuji  no  yūisei  o  ikasu 
senryaku o (Tokyo: Jiji Press Ltd., 2018), p.7.

Furthermore,  investment  may  be  reduced  as  firms  and  individuals  expect  continuous 
depopulation and slower economic growth accordingly. However, the impact of the decline 
in working-age population on the economy will not necessarily be negative. For example, in 
response  to  the  decline,  those  who  used  to  be  outside  the  labor  market  may  start  working 
and  their  potential  may  be  unlocked.  If  this  happens,  the  positive  impact  on  the  economy 
can  offset  the  negative  impact.  Also,  firms  may  promote  innovation  and  increase 
labor-saving  investment  in  such  areas  as  information  and  communication  technology  as 
well  as  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  in  order  to  make  more  effective  use  of  scarce  labor.  If 
such  developments  improve  the  overall  productivity,  the  economy  can  continue  growing, 
even in the face of the structural problem of a declining and aging population. 
 What  has  actually  happened  in  Japan's  economy  in  recent  years?  The  economy  was  in  a 
period of prolonged deflation in the second half of the "lost two decades," that is, from the 
late 1990s through the early 2010s (Chart 4). The output gap remained in negative territory 
for a long period, and the CPI continued to decline at an annual pace of around 0.4 percent 
on  average.  However,  Japan's  economy  has  improved  significantly  since  the  early  2010s, 
when  the  Bank  of  Japan  introduced  quantitative  and  qualitative  monetary  easing  (QQE), 
which differs considerably from the past policy frameworks.5  The output gap has improved 
for  the  past  few  years,  taking  hold  in  positive  territory.  The  economy  is  no  longer  in 
deflation  in  the  sense  of  a  sustained  decline  in  the  CPI.  Thus,  you  can  see  that  Japan's 
economic  activity  and  prices  have  improved  clearly,  although  the  declining  and  aging 
population has continued to weigh on the economy in a structural manner. 
 In the next part of this speech, let me describe the positive changes in Japan's economy, by 
comparing the present situation with the "lost two decades" or under deflation. I sometimes 
feel  that  many  people  do  not  necessarily  have  an  accurate  picture  of  the  current  state  of 
Japan's  economy  since  they  have  a  deeply-entrenched  negative  image  of  the  bubble  burst 
and deflation as well as the current declining and aging population. Thus, I will elaborate on 
the  positive  changes  in  Japan's  economy,  in  the  hope  that  you  will  better  understand  the

current situation. On that basis, I will also talk about the challenges. I personally think that 
economic growth and price stability can be achieved even given the structural problem of a 
declining  and  aging  population.  That  said,  it  is  true  that  there  are  many  challenges  to  be 
tackled beforehand. I would like to share my opinions on these challenges, which should be 
addressed with a view to ensuring further strength in Japan's economy. 
 I. Achievements and Changes   
I  would  like  to  talk  about  what  kind  of  positive  changes  have  taken  place  in  Japan's 
economy, by comparing the situation now with the "lost two decades" or under deflation. 
 A. Improvement in People's Lives 
First,  let  us  take  a  look  at  changes  in  household  income  as  a  whole  (Chart  5).  Nominal 
disposable  income  did  not  increase  for  a  long  time  following  the  late  1990s.  During  this 
period, real disposable income, adjusted for inflation, increased moderately  because prices 
continued  to  decline  somewhat.  However,  households  could  not  feel  the  increase  in  their 
income as nominal disposable income did not increase. Since the mid-2010s, there has been 
a  notable  change,  as  disposable  income  has  increased  clearly  in  both  nominal  and  real 
terms. 
 How have people perceived this change (Chart 6)? In a public opinion survey, people  were 
asked  how  satisfied  they  are  with  their  current  lives.  The  proportion  of  respondents 
answering that they were satisfied declined clearly from the late 1990s, to a level below that 
in  the  1980s.  However,  it  has  increased  notably  since  the  early  2010s,  and  recently 
registered a record high. This improvement in people's satisfaction with their lives is likely 
due  to  an  increase  in  their  income  stemming  from  economic  improvement.  In  fact,  in  the 
same  public  opinion  survey,  the  proportion  of  respondents  answering  satisfied  with  their 
income also rose significantly. 
 To see how far economic improvement has spread to households, I would like to look at the 
poverty rate (Chart 7). The poverty rate  for all households has peaked out in recent years, 
although it was previously on an uptrend. In particular, the child poverty rate has started to 
decline. Of course, there is room for improvement regarding the problem of poverty, but it 
 4 
is suggested that the improvement in financial conditions for a wide range of households is 
already happening gradually. 
 B. Changes in Labor Market Conditions 
What  lies  behind  the  improvement  in  people's  satisfaction  with  their  lives?  The  answer  is 
changes in labor market conditions (Chart 8). The unemployment rate has declined recently 
to  around  half  the  level  of  the  deflationary  period.  Since  the  working-age  population  has 
continued  to  decline  in Japan,  some may  suspect  that  this  is  just  due  to a  decline  in labor 
supply.  You  can  see  in  this  chart,  however,  that  the  improvement  in  the  employment 
situation  since  the  early  2010s  has  been  accompanied  by  an  increase  in  the  number  of 
employed  persons.  This  implies  that  the  recent  tightening  of  labor  market  conditions  is 
mainly due to an increase in labor demand, not a decline in labor supply. This improvement 
in  the  employment  situation  has  brought  about  an  increase  in  household  income,  with  the 
number of employed persons increasing and wages rising moderately. 
 Why  has  the  number  of  employed  persons  been  increasing  despite  the  declining 
working-age  population?  The  answer  is  a  significant  increase  in  labor  participation  by 
women and seniors. Chart 9 shows developments in the number of labor force participants 
and the labor force participation rates for working-age men and women as well as  seniors 
aged 65 and over. The labor force participation rate for each group is defined as the ratio of 
labor  force  participants to  the  respective  population.  In  the  past  few  years,  the  labor  force 
participation rate of working-age men has increased somewhat while being at a high level. 
Meanwhile, the  number  of  labor  force  participants among  this  group  has been  decreasing, 
along  with  the  decline  in  the  overall  working-age  population.  In  contrast,  the  labor  force 
participation  rate  of  working-age  women  has  been  rising  consistently.  Through  2012,  the 
number of labor force participants among this group decreased as the impact of the decline 
in  the  overall  working-age  population  was  large.  Since  2013,  however,  the  number  has 
started to increase as labor participation  by women has accelerated further. As for seniors, 
the number of labor force participants increased for a while after the mid-2000s along with 
a  rise  in  the  elderly  population,  even  without  a  rise  in  their  labor  force  participation  rate. 
Since 2013, the number has been increasing at a faster pace, as  seniors have become more 
active  in  participating  in  the  labor  market.  As  we  have  just  seen,  labor  participation  by 
 5 
women and seniors has increased considerably, and this is a significant change observed in 
the labor market since the early 2010s. 
 What then has prompted more women and seniors to enter the labor market in Japan? In the 
case of women, I  first need to explain the past situation of their labor participation (Chart 
10).  Looking  at  the  labor  force  participation  rate  of  women  by  age  group,  the  so-called 
M-shaped  curve  was  evident  in  the  late  1990s,  as  the  rate  was  lower  at  the  life  stage  of 
childbirth  and  child-rearing.  This  is  because,  when  working  women  in  Japan  reached  this 
life  stage,  there  was  a  strong  tendency  to  give  up  continuing  to  work  and  leave  the  labor 
market.  Recently,  however,  it  can  be  said  that  women  at  this  life  stage  continue  to 
participate in the labor market, and therefore the curve is generally no longer M-shaped. For 
almost all age groups, women's labor force participation rates in Japan now exceed those in 
the  United  States.  In  Japan,  women's  labor  participation  has  been  encouraged  by  a  rise  in 
labor demand due to economic improvement as well as by enhancement of the surrounding 
environment  through  various  measures  taken  by  both  the  public  and  corporate  sectors  so 
that  women  can  balance  child-rearing  and  a  career.  In  fact,  local  governments  have 
increased the provision of nursery facilities, and firms have actively set up childcare centers 
at their workplace  in an effort to avoid losing  female employees who are raising children. 
More  firms  have  offered  further  support  for  parental  leave  and  introduced  teleworking 
systems to allow employees to work at home without the burden of commuting. Thanks to 
these initiatives, fewer women now leave the labor market to raise children. 
 Next,  Chart  11  shows  changes  in  the  number  of  labor  force  participants  among  seniors, 
broken down into smaller age groups. You can see that labor participation has increased not 
only for those aged 65-69 but also for those aged 70 and over. This increase may be partly 
due to financial reasons such as the incremental rise in the pension age, but that alone is not 
a sufficient reason. As people get older, they tend to work for non-economic reasons, such 
as to find fulfillment in life or to make a social contribution. From another perspective, the 
slowing of physical aging seems to help seniors to continue working (Chart 12). Compared 
with  a  decade  ago,  for  example,  they  have  become  physically  younger  by  about  5  years 
based on their walking speed, and by about 10 years based on their number of teeth.  These 
changes in physical ability mean that it is not unnatural for people to continue working in 
 6 
their 70s, even though a decade ago it was regarded as natural that they retire at the age of 
65.6 
 In  Japan,  where  the  working-age  population  has  been  decreasing,  an  increase  in  labor 
participation by women and seniors is welcome in terms of accelerating economic growth. 
However, their labor force participation rates cannot exceed 100 percent. What we need to 
do now is to improve the productivity of the overall economy. I will come back to this later. 
 C. Changes in Firms' Behavior 
Thus  far  we  have  looked  at  changes  in  the  household  sector,  focusing  on  labor  market 
conditions. Signs of change have also been seen in the corporate sector. 
 Firms  have  proactively  responded  to  labor  shortages.  Amid  tight  labor  market  conditions, 
firms  have  increased  labor-saving  investment  to  save  human  resources  and  have  used 
capital  as  a  substitute.  In  Japan's  manufacturing  sector,  there  has  been  active  labor-saving 
investment. Based on the tough experience of surges in crude oil prices during two oil crises 
in  the  1970s,  manufacturers  have  taken  initiatives  since  the  1980s  to  cut  costs  and 
streamline production processes, for example, by introducing production robots. In the face 
of  globalization,  large  manufacturing  firms  exposed  to  severe  competition,  in  particular, 
have  continued  to  make  such  efforts.  By  contrast,  in  the  nonmanufacturing  sector,  where 
many  industries  are  labor-intensive,  firms  seemed  less  enthusiastic  about  undertaking 
labor-saving investment. This is partly because they were able to take advantage of a stable 
supply  of  low-wage  workers,  such  as  part-timers,  and  did  not  face  such  fierce  global 
competition.  However,  reflecting  the  recent  tight  labor  market  conditions,  labor-intensive 
nonmanufacturers  have  begun  working  toward  saving  labor  (Chart  13).  Since  the  early 
2010s, labor-intensive industries such as "construction," "retailing," and "accommodations, 
eating  and  drinking  services"  have  been  actively  making  labor-saving  investment,  as  you

A  study  in  the  United  States  shows  that  the  average  age  of  the  founders  of  the  top  0.1  percent 
fastest-growing  start-up  firms  is  45.  See  Pierre  Azoulay  et  al.,  "Age  and  High-Growth 
Entrepreneurship," NBER Working Paper, no.24489, 2018.

can  see  from  the  clear  increase  in  their  software  investment.  For  example,  even  at  small 
restaurants in Japan, you can find tablet computers at your table allowing you to order just 
by  tapping.  This  kind  of  system  helps  restaurants  to  save  labor  in  taking  orders  from 
customers and improve efficiency in sales management. Construction sites, which have also 
faced  labor  shortages,  have  been  adopting  new  technologies.  One  example  is  the 
introduction  of  survey  systems  using  drones.  Another  is  the  use  of  AI  to  analyze 
accumulated  information  to  complement  operations  which  used  to  rely  largely  on  skilled 
workers'  experience.  The  clear  rise  in  labor  productivity  since  the  early  2010s  appears  to 
reflect  these  initiatives  by  firms,  enabled  by  remarkable  technological  progress  in  recent 
years. 
 The changes that I have just outlined may be seen as a passive response to labor tightening, 
but you can find more proactive initiatives (Chart 14). There has been a steady increase in 
the  number  of  mergers  and  acquisitions  (M&As)  made  by  Japanese  firms,  although  their 
total value has fluctuated considerably due to some large-scale M&As. Moreover, although 
the  firms'  entry  rate  was  low  during  the  "lost  two  decades,"  it  seems  that  there  have  been 
signs of a rise recently, albeit at a lower level than that of the United States. I think that the 
expansion  of  such  initiatives  can  be  seen  as  a  positive  change  for  Japanese  firms,  which 
used to be considered cautious about taking risks after the collapse of the bubble economy. 
 II. Challenges Ahead 
So  far,  I  have  talked  about  the  positive  changes  in  Japan's  economy  after  the  "lost  two 
decades."  Its  growth  potential,  however,  needs  to  be  further  enhanced.  Moreover,  we  are 
still only halfway toward achieving the Bank of Japan's price stability target of 2 percent. I 
think that there are still many challenges to be addressed in raising Japan's growth potential. 
In the remaining part of my speech, I would like to focus on the challenges toward raising 
productivity in Japan's economy amid a declining and aging population. In order to improve 
productivity, it is necessary to invest in human resources so that more and more people can 
enhance  their  knowledge  and  skills.  It  is  also  important  to  create  and  maintain  an  "open" 
economic and social system that encourages people to make the best use of their abilities. 
  8 
A. Expected Changes in the Corporate Sector 
As  I  mentioned  earlier,  firms'  efforts  to  raise  labor  productivity  by,  for  example,  making 
labor-saving  investment  have  spread  not  only  to  the  manufacturing  sector  but  also  to  the 
nonmanufacturing  sector.  However,  even  if  labor  productivity  rises,  there  is  no  guarantee 
that  the  overall  productivity  of  the  economy,  including  capital  productivity,  will  increase. 
Let us consider the case where capital, such as robots, substitutes for labor. If this is a mere 
substitution  of  one  unit  of  labor  with  one  unit  of  capital  and  the  value  added  remains  the 
same, the overall productivity will not change substantially because labor productivity will 
rise while capital productivity declines. 
 In  fact,  developments  in  TFP  of  various  production  factors,  including  the  effective  use  of 
capital, have differed from developments in labor productivity growth, which has increased 
significantly  (Chart  15).  TFP  growth  has  been  relatively  high  in  the  IT-producing  sector, 
such  as  for  manufacturers  of  electronic  parts  and  electrical machinery.  In  contrast,  growth 
has  been  sluggish  in  the  IT-using  sector,  which  includes  most  of  the  nonmanufacturing 
industries  with  a  high  ratio  of  software  investment  to  overall  investment,  such  as 
"information  and  communications,"  "transport  and  postal  services,"  as  well  as  "wholesale 
and  retail  trade."  While  the  deceleration  in  TFP  growth  has  become  a  common  concern 
among advanced economies, TFP growth has remained low in Japan's IT-using sector since 
the 2000s. Among the many hypotheses proposed to explain this low growth, I would like to 
focus on the stance of Japanese firms toward the use of IT. 
 According  to  a  survey  asking  Japanese  firms  why  they  have  increased  their  IT-related 
budget, many answered that it was to improve business efficiency and cut costs. This is in 
contrast  with  U.S.  firms,  which  have  incorporated  new  technologies  to  encourage 
innovative  initiatives  such  as  developing  products  and  services.  Although  an  increasing 
number of Japanese firms have recently started to try new technologies, not many seem to 
have  made  them  work  for  successful  innovation.  New  technologies,  such  as  AI  and  the 
Internet  of  Things  (IoT),  continue  to make  rapid  progress.  I  hope  that Japanese  firms  will 
adopt these technologies  not  only  to  cut  costs and streamline  production  processes,  which 
they are good at, but also make more active use of them to enhance the value added through 
innovation.

B.  Expected  Changes  in  the  Household  Sector:  Further  Active  Participation  by 
Women and the Young 
Then,  what  changes  are  expected  in  the  household  sector  with  a  view  to  improving 
productivity?  As  I  pointed  out  earlier,  the  increased  labor  participation  by  women  and 
seniors  is  a  very  positive  development  for  Japan's  economy,  given  the  decline  in  the 
working-age population. The next step is to fully unlock people's potential. In the following, 
I  would  like  to  focus  on  the  challenges  toward  encouraging  a  greater  contribution  by 
women and the young. 
 Let  me  start  with  the  issue  of  unlocking  women's  potential.  I  would  like  to  first  look  at 
developments  in  the  income  levels  of  men  and  women  over  their  lifetime  (Chart  16).  We 
can see that women's income level clearly falls behind men's as they get older. One possible 
reason  is  that,  in  the  past,  the  university  enrollment  rate  of  women  was  relatively  low 
compared to that  of  men.  Another reason  is  that  women may  have  less  chance to  develop 
their  job  skills,  since  they  tend  to  give  up  continuing  to  work  in  order  to  raise  children.7 
With  regard  to  women's  job  skills,  I  would  like to  show  an  analysis  of  the  gap  in  literacy 
between men and women (Chart 17). Across countries, there is no significant gender gap in 
the levels of literacy. As for the frequency of skill use in the workplace, however, the gender 
gap is more evident in Japan than in other countries. In Japan, women use their literacy at 
work much less frequently than men, suggesting that women are less likely to be assigned 
highly-skilled tasks.8 
 As these observations imply, I think that women's potential has not yet been fully unlocked 
in Japan (Chart 18). For example, while the proportion of women to total employed persons 
is comparable to that of other countries, the proportion of women in managerial positions is 
clearly lower. In addition, surveys on the underutilization of labor show that many women 
wish to increase their working hours, particularly middle-aged women who have completed

the early stages of child-rearing. There seems to be quite a few women who want to return 
to a full-time job after child-rearing but are unable to do so. 
 Given the declining and aging population in Japan, it is essential that women not only enter 
the labor market but use their abilities to the fullest extent. Is Japan heading in this direction 
(Chart  19)?  With  regard  to  the  educational  environment  before  becoming  employed,  30 
years ago the percentage of women enrolled in a four-year university was only about half of 
that of men, but in recent years it has risen to a level comparable to that of men. Thus, as for 
pre-employment education, it can be said that the gender gap has been generally eliminated. 
In addition, although the employment rate for women tended to be lower than that for men, 
it has recently exceeded that for men. Moreover, an increasing number of firms have been 
providing  learning  opportunities  for  women  during  their  parental  leave  so  that  they  can 
maintain  and  improve  their  skills.  There  has  also  been  an  increase  in  firms'  initiatives  to 
share  work-related  information  with  women  on  parental  leave  so  that  they  can  catch  up 
more  easily  when  they  return  to  work.  As  these  examples  show,  it  seems  that  an 
environment  is  being  created  to  encourage  women  to  make  full  use  of  their  abilities.  Of 
course, there are still many women who have completed their child-rearing but have given 
up on rejoining the labor market. It is also important to provide these women with recurrent 
education  to  enable  them  to  improve  their  skills  and  take  positions  requiring  high  skills 
when they re-enter the labor market. 
 Next,  I  would  like  to  move  on  to  the  young.  From  a  long-term  perspective,  education  is 
extremely important in improving productivity. Macroeconomic productivity benefits from 
creating an environment that enables children to become better educated regardless of their 
economic conditions by, for example, providing free education. 
 Given  the  globalization  of  corporate  activities,  education  is  also  key  to  developing 
internationally  competent  talent.  On  this  point,  I  would  like  to  show  you  some  data 
regarding  the  number  of  Japanese  students  studying  abroad  (Chart  20).  The percentage  of 
Japanese students enrolled in foreign schools peaked out in the 2000s. However, the number 
of  students  studying  abroad  for  shorter  periods  while  enrolled  at Japanese  universities  has 
continued to increase. This data can be viewed in a number of ways, but I think the fact that 
 11 
an increasing number of young people in Japan have experienced studying abroad, even if 
only for a short time, can be seen as the first step in fostering more skilled individuals ready 
for a globalized world. 
 However, there is still room for improvement in Japan with regard to enrollment in graduate 
schools.  The  proportion  of  female  graduates  at  Ph.D.  level  is  31  percent  for  Japan,  the 
lowest among the OECD countries, where the average is 47 percent.9 
 Let  me  briefly  talk  about  Japan's  financial  sector  in  relation  to  the  asset  building  of 
households.  Japan's  household  financial  assets  have  increased  steadily,  reaching  1,860 
trillion  yen  at the  end  of  June  2019.  In  this  situation,  there  have  been  changes  in  both  the 
household  and  financial  sectors.  Households'  investment  in  financial  assets  other  than 
deposits  has  been  gradually  observed.  The  financial  industry  is  one  of  the  industries  that 
have  been  affected  by  the  structural  factor  of  a  declining  and  aging  population  amid  the 
economic  improvement.  However,  it  has  also  seen  steady  progress  in  globalization  and 
technological  innovation.  Japanese  financial  institutions  are  increasingly  extending  their 
overseas  operations  and  making  alliances  with  a  wide  variety  of  businesses,  including 
so-called FinTech firms, to offer new services to customers.   
 Conclusion 
Today,  I  have  talked about  the  positive  changes  in Japan's  economy  and  future  challenges 
from  a  somewhat  longer-term  perspective.  Hopefully  you  have  gained  the  impression  that 
Japan's  economy  has  continued  to  grow  after  the  "lost  two  decades."  Women  and  seniors' 
labor  participation  as  well  as  firms'  initiatives  to  increase  labor-saving  investment  have 
offset  the  negative  impact  of  the  declining  population.  However,  the  declining  and  aging 
population  will  continue  to  weigh  on  Japan's  economy.  For  the  economy  to  continue 
growing under such circumstances, it is essential to further increase productivity. Japan still 
has untapped potential and room to reform and improve in many fields. Once we unlock our 
potential to the fullest extent, we can overcome the challenges.

Let me conclude my speech by sharing my thoughts on the links between  monetary policy 
and  the  enhancement  of  economic  growth  potential,  as  well  as  the  role  of  central  banks. 
Economic growth potential is supposed to be enhanced mainly by changes in the behavior 
of private entities with the support of the government's growth policy. Meanwhile, the Bank 
of Japan's monetary policy aims at achieving the price stability target of 2 percent, and there 
are  synergy  effects  between  the  efforts  of  various  economic  entities  and  the  Bank's 
monetary  policy.  The  expected  growth  rate  of  Japan's  economy  is  likely  to  rise  as  private 
firms actively undertake investment in capital and human resources as well as innovation. It 
is also likely to rise as the government establishes a business environment that encourages 
such  investment  and  makes  beneficial  public  spending,  including  on  education  and  the 
promotion of science and technology. As the expected growth rate rises, firms' investment 
and households' consumption will be encouraged further, thereby ensuring the path toward 
achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. 
 At the same time, I think that monetary easing itself can in turn contribute to enhancing the 
growth potential in some ways.10  One way is that, as monetary easing has  made clear the 
problems  of  labor  shortages  and  supply  constraints resulting  from  demand increase,  it  has 
consequently  highlighted  the  issue  of  Japan's  growth  potential  that  lies  behind  these 
problems.  Although  a  decline  in  the  growth  potential  has  long  been  recognized  as  a 
challenge  of  Japan's  economy,  it  was  not  seen  as  an  immediate  issue  when  the  economy 
faced deficient demand. It was not until labor shortages and supply constraints materialized 
due  to  the  increase  in  demand  that  people  actually  started  to  take  concrete  action  toward 
enhancing  the  growth  potential  and  increasing  the  economy's  supply  capacity.  People 
acquire  skills  through  their  daily  work,  thereby  raising  their  productivity.  In  particular, 
whether or not young people have opportunities to enhance their skills at work affects their 
future careers, as well as the productivity of the overall economy. It is vital that the younger 
generation  is  provided  diverse  and  stable  job  opportunities.  A  decline  in  the  long-term 
unemployment rate also  increases the economy's productivity, since skills  could be lost as 
unemployment  becomes  prolonged.  Widespread  improvements  in  the  labor  market  are

likely to raise the growth potential of Japan's economy. 
 Another  possible  contribution  of  monetary  easing  is  to  encourage  firms  to  become  more 
active. With the experience of prolonged deflation, Japanese firms have been cautious about 
taking  risks  and  have  remained  persistently  prudent  toward  business  investment and  wage 
increases. I believe that, if our monetary policy improves overall economic activity, it will 
encourage firms to change their behavior premised on deflation and take positive initiatives 
toward making active investment and raising productivity further.11 
 Japan has experienced stagnation and deflation for a long time. The Bank of Japan aims at 
achieving  price  stability,  thereby  contributing  to  the  sound  development  of  the  national 
economy.  From  now  on,  when  a  children's  book  is  written,  I  would  prefer  not  to  see  a 
phrase  such  as  "it  is  a  very  difficult  place  to  live  because  there  has  been  a  decades-long 
stagnation." 
 Thank you for your attention.

Notes: 2. In the right chart, for figures based on employment insurance, entry rate =  number of business establishments newly covered by employment insurance / number of business 
establishments covered by employment insurance at the end of previous fiscal year × 100. For figures based on business establishments, entry rate = number of newly 
established business establishments / number of existing business establishments at the beginning of the year. For figures based on incorporation registration, entry rate =  number 
of incorporation registrations / number of  firms in previous year × 100. To allow for comparison, period averages of figures based on employment insurance and incorporation 
registration are calculated in line with those based on business establishments, which is least frequently surveyed.

Notes: 1. In the left chart, TFP is measured by using SNA data classified by economic activity in the "Annual Report on National Accounts." IT-producing sector is composed of electronic 
components and devices; electrical machinery, equipment and supplies; and information and communication electronics equipment.  IT-using sector is composed of  9 industries in 
which the ratio of software investment to GDP is relatively high: information and communications; transport and postal services; wholesale and retail trade; accommodation and 
food service activities; professional, scientific and technical activities; electricity, gas and water supply and waste management service; chemicals; textile products; other manufacturing.
2. In the right chart, figures are based on the 2017 JEITA/IDC Japan survey.

Notes: 1. In the left chart, the definition of "managers" varies across countries. In Japan, managers include corporate executives, managerial personnel equivalent to or above section 
chief, and managerial government officers.
Notes: 2. In the right chart, "employed persons in time-related underemployment" means employed persons with weekly working hours of less than 35 hours who are wishing and able to
work additional hours. "Available potential jobseekers" means those who have not been seeking a job within one month, but who are wishing and ready to work if work is
available.
