Long-term trends – important elements 
in the monetary policy analysis1 
I shall begin by thanking you for the invitation. Coming here to the Swedish Eco-
nomics Association to discuss various issues concerning the Riksbank's activities is 
something I really appreciate and enjoy. Today's speech is actually the fourteenth 
I have given, so it is beginning to be rather a habit to come back here every year.  
I intend to devote a large part of today's speech to the Swedish labour market and 
some of the overall trends and challenges it is facing, that is, what are usually 
known as “structural changes”. In this context it may be worth reminding our-
selves of the predictions of two famous economists. Almost 90 years ago, John 
Maynard Keynes predicted that the rapid automation of work tasks would lead to 
“technological unemployment”.2 Another famous economist, Wassily Leontief, 
foresaw similar problems 20 years later: “Labour will become less and less im-
portant ... More and more workers will be replaced by machines. I do not see that 
new industries can employ everybody who wants a job”.3  
As we know, these predictions have not come true, but nevertheless a similar de-
bate has arisen recently. For instance, a report that received considerable atten-
tion recently warned that every second job in Sweden would disappear within 20 
years.4 At the same time, there is another ongoing debate about demographic de-
velopments, with an increasing ageing population and several people therefore 
saying that we need an increase in labour immigration and better integration to 
maintain welfare at the current levels.    
                                                           
1 I would like to thank Magnus Jonsson for his help with writing the speech and Emelie Theobald for her help 
with data and figures. I would also like to thank Mattias Erlandsson, Jesper Hansson, Goran Katinic, Åsa Olli- 
Segendorf, Cecilia Roos-Isaksson, Marianne Sterner, Ulf Söderström and Anders Vredin for valuable comments 
and Elizabeth Nilsson for helping to translate the speech into English.

   Changes in trends are difficult to predict, as they are not visible until a certain 
amount of time has passed, as illustrated by the predictions of Keynes and Leon-
tief. I will therefore not make any attempt to predict developments in the labour 
market today, but instead look back at what has happened. There are many indi-
cations that there have been several trend changes in the labour market in the pe-
riod following the financial crisis 2008-2009. I would like to discuss some of these 
and the extent to which they may have contributed to lower prices and wages and 
a flatter Phillips curve. Moreover, I shall discuss the increasing migration and de-
mographical developments with an ageing population and what economic effects 
this may have. 
Another structural change concerns the declining trend in real interest rates 
around the world. This is a change that has been under way for a long time and 
has also affected Swedish interest rates. Sweden is a small open economy with 
free movement of capital and our interest rates therefore adapt to international 
interest rates. This adjustment does not always need to be perfect, which is an-
other thing I intend to take up. In conclusion, I shall discuss how different types of 
uncertainty, including uncertainty over long-term trends, can affect monetary pol-
icy decisions.  
Long-term trends and monetary policy   
Economic developments are driven by different types of technological innova-
tions. At present, there is a lot of talk about the rapid digitalisation, automation 
and globalisation that can have major significance for how different markets func-
tion and for the economy as a whole. With regard to monetary policy, the finan-
cial markets and the labour market are particularly important in this context. This 
is because two long-term levels – the long-term real interest rate and the long-
term sustainable level of resource utilisation – are determined on these two mar-
kets. These two levels are so important that they have been given special “star 
status” in the monetary policy literature: The long-term real interest rate is nor-
mally called 𝒓𝒓∗ (”r-star”) and the long-term sustainable level of resource utilisa-
tion is known as the 𝒚𝒚∗ (“y star”).5 I will llustrate why these two long-term levels 
play such an important role by using a so-called monetary policy rule. 
A monetary policy rule describes a suitable level for the policy rate based on a few 
factors. No central bank relies on one such rule in the actual policy rate decisions, 
but such a rule can function as a good benchmark for the policy rate. Different 
monetary policy rules are also used extensively in the academic literature, as they 
have been proved to describe the development of the policy rate relatively well, 
in particular under normal economic conditions.6  
One common monetary policy rule is the so-called Taylor rule.7 There are differ-
ent variations on this, but most often one uses a version that can be described 
with the following mathematical equation,    
                                                           
5 See, for instance, Powell (2018) and Tenreyro (2019). 
6 See Jonsson and Katinic (2017) who show how well a monetary policy rule can describe the Swedish policy rate 
since the inflation target was introduced.   
7 See Taylor (1993). 
  2 [24] 
    𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡=𝒓𝒓∗+2+𝛼𝛼(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−2)+𝛽𝛽(𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡−𝒚𝒚∗), 
where 𝑅𝑅 denotes the policy rate, 𝒓𝒓∗ the long-term real interest rate, 2 is the cen-
tral bank’s inflation target, 𝜋𝜋 the actual inflation rate, 𝑦𝑦 the actual resource utilisa-
tion and 𝒚𝒚∗ the long-term sustainable level for resource utilisation. The parame-
two per cent and 𝛽𝛽 how strongly the policy rate reacts when resource utilisation 
deviates from its long-term sustainable level.  
According to the Taylor rule, the development of the policy rate depends on three 
factors: 
ter α determines how strongly the policy rate reacts when inflation deviates from 
 1.  The sum of the long-term real interest rate and the inflation target of two 
per cent.  
2.  The deviation of inflation from the target of two per cent. 
3.  Resource utilisation's deviation from the long-term sustainable level for 
resource utilisation.   
 inflation target. If the inflation target is constant, the long-term policy rate, in 
𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡= 𝑅𝑅�=𝒓𝒓∗+2, 
The Taylor rule illustrates, in other words, how both the long-term real interest 
rate and resource utilisation’s long-term sustainable level have major signifi-
cance for the level of the policy rate.  
The long-term real interest rate plays an important role for the long-term level of 
the policy rate, which can also be illustrated by the Taylor rule. In the long run, 
when inflation is on target and resource utilisation is at its long-term sustainable 
level, the Taylor rule can be described as follows,  
 
What roles do 𝒓𝒓∗ and 𝒚𝒚∗ play for monetary policy? 
where 𝑅𝑅� refers to the long-term level of the policy rate and 2 is as before the cen-
tral bank's inflation target. The long-term policy rate is thus equal to 𝒓𝒓∗ plus the 
practice the average policy rate, is determined by 𝒓𝒓∗. For instance, if  𝒓𝒓∗ declines it

Let us assume that resource utilisation is equal to 𝒚𝒚∗ initially and that 𝒚𝒚∗ then 
which is an important factor behind the low interest rates in Sweden. I will return 
to this later.  
Resource utilisation's long-term sustainable level also plays an important role for 
monetary policy, but in a slightly different way. The long-term level of the policy

this is the case.  
rises to a higher level. Resource utilisation is then lower than its long-term level, 
that is, resource utilisation can be said to be lower than “normal” and we have 
“an economic downturn”. This dampens inflationary pressures and the policy rate 
means that the policy rate’s long-term (average) level declines at the same pace. 
  3 [24] 
   is then cut temporarily to increase resource utilisation and inflationary pressures. 
A more expansionary monetary policy makes resource utilisation begin to rise and 
adapt to the new, higher level at the same time as inflation returns to the target. 
The policy rate thus returns to its original level. If conditions change in such a way 
that it affects what we regard as the normal level of resource utilisation, 𝒚𝒚∗, the 
policy rate will be temporarily affected during a transition period. 
I will not discuss the long-term level of resource utilisation per se today, but in-
stead describe some apparent new trends that have taken place on the labour 
market after the financial crisis. Although these new trends do not give direct 
measures of resource utilisation or its long-term level, they may still have implica-
tions. Some of the new trends, such as the upturn in labour force participation, 
may mean that the labour supply increases in the long-term, which can increase 
the production potential in the economy and the long-term level of resource utili-
sation. While, for instance, a poorer matching efficiency probably means that the 
long-term level of resource utilisation falls. 
A constantly changing labour market 
Changes in the labour market affect all of us. The period following the financial 
crisis 2008-2009 has to a large extent been concerned with how the labour mar-
ket might be affected by the rapid development in information and communica-
tion technology, especially the so-called digitalisation, which makes it possible to 
automate an increasing number of work tasks – both routine tasks and some 
more advanced ones. The increasingly rapid globalisation process, which will 
probably involve greater labour mobility between countries and regions, has also 
attracted attention. At the same time, we are moving towards a population struc-
ture with an ageing population and we have large migration flows around the 
world. It is difficult to know exactly how this will affect the labour market and the 
way it functions. I do not intend to speculate on this, but instead discuss some 
changes that appear to be a trend that has taken place over the past ten years.  
Trends on the labour market following the financial cri-
sis  
Over the past ten years there has been an almost trend rise in both labour force 
participation – the proportion of the population of working age in the labour force  
– and the employment rate – the number of employed as a percentage of the 
working age population. This is an essentially positive development, as it reflects 
the fact that an increasing number of people have the opportunity to get a job 
and that more people have got a job. Figure 1a shows how labour force participa-
tion has increased steadily from around 71 per cent just after the financial crisis to 
more than 73 per cent today. This positive development can probably be ex-
plained in several ways. The high population growth, which is to some extent due 
to a high level of migration, could be one factor. A large proportion of the immi-
grants who have come to Sweden in recent years have been in the age range 25 
to 54 years of age, which is a group with a high labour force participation rate. An-
other factor could be various economic policy reforms that have increased incen-
tives to participate in the labour force. 
  4 [24] 
   Another less positive development is the deterioration in matching efficiency. This 
could be a sign that companies’ requirements and the job seekers’ abilities do not 
match – for instance because of structural change or deficiencies in the educa-
tional system – or because the search and recruitment processes have declined in 
quality. It therefore becomes more time-consuming and costly for companies to 
recruit staff.  
Matching efficiency fell heavily in connection with the financial crisis, see Figure 
1b.8 This need not necessarily be a problem. During economic downturns, some 
types of competence become outdated at the same time as other and new com-
petences are in demand. For the individual, this can mean that some form of fur-
ther education becomes necessary. The problem is that matching efficiency ap-
pears to have become entrenched at around the same levels as in 2010. This can 
lead to many unemployed people losing work-related competence, which can fur-
ther limit their opportunities on the labour market.

Taxation and compensation systems determine to a large extent how the labour 
market functions. This affects the employees’ incentives to take part in the labour 
force and accept new job offers. One important factor in this context is the em-
ployees’ compensation rate – unemployment benefit in relation to wages. This 
determines how much of his or her income an individual can retain if he or she 
becomes unemployed. The compensation rate has declined steadily since the be-
ginning of the 2000s, with the exception of the years 2015-2016, see Figure 2a. 
The most important factor behind this development is rising wages, but lower 
compensation ceilings in the unemployment insurance and income tax credits 
have also had an effect. 
Another trend on the labour market is that fewer and fewer employees are mem-
bers of trade unions. Since the early 2000s the percentage of trade union mem-
bers has declined by around 15 per cent. Part of the downturn reflects the fact 
that people born abroad more often refrain from joining a trade union and these

   people are also overrepresented in the private services sector, where the percent-
age of trade union members has fallen the most.9 There has also been a trend in-
crease in the number of people with fixed-term employment contracts, see Figure 
2b. These people often have a weaker foothold in the labour market and probably 
also a weaker negotiating position. The reduction in trade union membership and 
increase in fixed-term employment contracts may be indications that employees’ 
negotiating power has declined. If that is the case, it could have implications for 
both wage developments and inflation.

 Changes on the labour market may have contributed to lower 
prices and wages 
The period following the financial crisis was a challenge, from a monetary policy 
perspective. Inflation has on many occasions been lower than expected and even 
below the target. On average, inflation measured in terms of the CPIF has been 
around 0.3 percentage points lower after the financial crisis than before, see Fig-
ure 3a. But it is not only inflation that has been lower than expected, wages have 
also been lower. Wage increases have been around 1.1 percentage points lower 
after the financial crisis, see Figure 3b. The low outcomes have surprised not only 
the Riksbank, but also many other analysts.  
But despite inflation and wage increases being lower than expected, resource uti-
lisation – measured as a shortage of labour – has not been unusually low. It has on 
average been at around the same levels as prior to the financial crisis, see Figure 
3c. Monetary policy has in turn been expansionary, with a policy rate that has on 
average been just over 2.5 percentage points lower after the financial crisis than 
before it, see Figure 3d. In addition, there have been large purchases of govern-
ment bonds to make monetary policy even more expansionary.

This development has not been unique to Sweden; we have seen similar tenden-
cies in several other countries, see Figures 4a–d. In the euro area, the other Nor-
dic countries and the United States, both inflation and wage increases have been 
lower after the financial crisis. At the same time, resource utilisation in terms of 
labour shortages has been at roughly the same level as prior to the financial crisis 
and policy rates have been very low in an historical perspective, as in Sweden. The 
United Kingdom stands out with a somewhat higher inflation and Germany stands 
out with higher resource utilisation following the financial crisis.        
No consensus has yet emerged among economists and researchers regarding the 
causes of the relatively low outcomes regarding prices and wages, either in Swe-
den or abroad. During the years immediately following the financial crisis, the low 
inflation in Sweden was said to be explained by weak international economic ac-
tivity combined with low energy prices that held back cost increases. Other causes 
were a stronger krona and companies having squeezed their margins to a greater 
extent than previously.10  
On a general level, the increasing globalisation and technological developments, 
with an increasingly rapid digitalisation, are probably important causes behind the 
low increases in prices and wages. Now that more products are being produced in

Two economists at the Riksbank have studied how the changes on the labour mar-
ket that I described may have affected prices and wages following the financial 
crisis.11 They illustrate in an economic model that the developments on the labour 
market could have been a contributory factor to the low outcomes in prices and 
wages. In more concrete terms, they show that increased labour force participa-
tion, lower compensation levels and weaker negotiating strength among employ-
ees may have dampening effects on prices and wages.  
If labour force participation increases, it will become easier for companies to find 
new competence. This reduces recruitment costs. Payroll costs also decline as in-
creased competition for jobs dampens wage demands. All in all, lower costs lead 
to a downward pressure on prices. Another mechanism that my also mean that 
the rising labour force participation has contributed to lower prices and wages is 
discussed by two economists at the Bank of International Settlements.12 They say 
that there has been a change in the composition of the labour force over the past

  8 [24] 
   ten years. Labour force participation in the age group 55-64 years has tangibly in-
creased, which has slowed down prices and wages.    
If the compensation levels are lower, employees will have greater incentive to ac-
cept lower wages. This will also lead to companies’ costs declining and to price 
pressures slowing down. If employees’ negotiating strength weakens, their scope 
to have their wage demands accepted declines. This means lower wages and a 
downward adjustment in prices.  
One should not draw any definite conclusions regarding the implications for mon-
etary policy on the basis of these results. While lower price pressures in them-
selves might justify a more expansionary monetary policy, decisions on the policy 
rate consist of an overall assessment of various different factors, where develop-
ments on the labour market are one such factor. On the other hand, one can say 
on the basis of these results that supply effects and long-term trends may be im-
portant pieces of the puzzle for monetary policy analysis. This is something that 
has been emphasised in other studies, too.13  
A flatter Phillips curve need not signify less of an impact from 
monetary policy.  
In addition to the discussion on the causes of the low levels of wage increases and 
inflation, there have also been a discussion of the possibility that the flatter Phil-
lips curve, that is, the weaker covariation between wage increases and unemploy-
ment, may have led to a deterioration in monetary policy’s capacity to steer infla-
tion. We can see in Figures 5a and 5b that in the period prior to the financial crisis 
the Phillips curve had a negative slope, so that lower unemployment was linked to 
higher wage increases, but that after the financial crisis it has become flatter and 
slightly positive.

The apparently weaker link between wages and unemployment is not merely a 
Swedish phenomenon. Similar weakening has taken place in the euro area, the 
United States and the United Kingdom.14 There are several explanations for this

   development, even if there is no consensus in the literature regarding the under-
lying causes. Here I shall take up a possible reason that does not seem to have 
been given much attention in the general debate and may therefore be of inter-
est. 
The first thing to note is that it is not surprising that the covariation, or, as we 
economists say, the correlation between economic variables varies over time. If 
we were to study two random economic variables over a longer period of time, it 
is probable that the covariation between them would vary between different 
points in time because the economy is constantly changing. For a central bank, 
however, it may nevertheless seem slightly worrying that it is the slope of the 
Phillips curve that has changed, as it has such a prominent role in monetary policy 
analysis.      
A common reasoning by a central bank might be: “We have seen an increase in 
unemployment recently. This has led to the labour market becoming less tight and 
to companies now being able to find new staff more easily – the competition for 
jobs has thus become greater. This dampens wage increases, which in turn pushes 
down prices. According to this reasoning, the covariation between wages and un-
employment should be negative.  
There is nothing wrong with this reasoning in itself, but it is not complete as the 
cause of the increase in unemployment is not stated. The reasoning works well for 
pedagogical purposes, but to understand why the covariation has changed, we 
also need to know why unemployment has increased.  
To explain why economic variables fluctuate over time, economists assume that 
the economy has been hit by “shocks” which affect consumption, savings, invest-
ment, prices, wages and so on. Shocks are what economists often refer to as ex-
ogenous changes. This means changes that occur independently of the behaviour 
of households and companies. In principle, one can say that such changes cannot 
actually exist.15 The exogenous changes that often arise as explanations – techno-
logical developments, demographic changes, various changes on the labour mar-
ket, globalisation, just to take a few examples – are all in one way or another the 
consequence of decisions made by households and companies.  
But although this is the case, it is often convenient in economic theory to make a 
distinction between exogenous factors and the factors one wants to explain. It is 
quite simply a question of simplifying reality to be able to understand it better. To 
understand why the Phillips curve has become flatter, we therefore need to know 
which exogenous changes that might affect its slope and a theory on how the 
changes affect it.    
I shall in two examples illustrate how the slope of the Phillips curve is affected by 
two different exogenous changes.16 The two examples aim to illustrate how the 
slope can be negative or positive, depending on which exogenous changes are 
driving economic developments. My hypothesis is thus that the flatter Phillips 
                                                           
15 An example of a true exogenous change that is sometimes mentioned is the weather, but weather is of course 
of less significance in today’s developed economies than it was during the days of the agricultural society. 
16 For a description of the theory I have used, see Jonsson and Theobald (2019). This study also contains other 
examples than the ones I show here, which illustrate other possible causes of the flatter Phillips curve.   
  10 [24] 
   curve may be due to the economy being exposed to different types of exogenous 
changes after the financial crisis than before it, which has changed the slope of 
the Phillips curve in a flatter direction. It is of course difficult to verify this hypoth-
esis in practice, just as it is difficult to verify other possible hypotheses, and this 
cannot be done today. It would require a more in-depth analysis, where one tries 
to identify in more detail which exogenous changes have been important prior to 
and after the financial crisis.   
In the first example, the exogenous changes are in labour force participation. To 
illustrate the economic intuition, let unemployment increase as a result of more 
people entering the labour force. It will then become easier and cheaper for com-
panies to find new staff and the vacancies will be filled faster. But for those peo-
ple entering the labour force, it will nevertheless take some time to seek and find 
a new job. Unemployment will therefore increase, at least initially. An increase in 
labour force participation will also increase competition for jobs. Employees’ 
wage demands will therefore be more subdued.  
When labour force participation increases, the covariation between unemploy-
ment and wages will become negative. But it is important to understand here that 
the negative covariation is due to the increase in labour force participation, that 
is, the causality goes from labour force participation to unemployment and 
wages. It is thus not rising unemployment in itself that causes lower wages. The 
covariation between unemployment and wages that is observed in the data is 
only a correlation, which does not say anything about which affects what. Figure 
6a illustrates how exogenous changes in labour force participation affect wages 
and unemployment. The covariation is negative, as expected.

In the second example, it is exogenous changes in productivity that affect the fluc-
tuations in the economy. The effects on wages and unemployment can be illus-
trated as follows. An increase in productivity leads to companies’ production costs 
being lower. Prices can then be cut and production can rise, which reduces unem-
ployment. The increase in productivity does lead to real wages rising, but because 
the price fall is greater than the increase in real wages, this means that the nomi-
nal wages fall. In this example, therefore, both nominal wages and unemployment 
decline and the covariation is therefore positive. This should not be interpreted to 
mean that lower unemployment leads to lower nominal wages – the causality 
  11 [24] 
   goes from improved productivity leading to lower nominal wages and also lower 
unemployment. Figure 6b shows the example. The Phillips curve has a positive 
slope, as you can see.   
Central banks consider it important to understand why the Phillips curve has be-
come flatter as this has implications for monetary policy and its impact. If the flat-
ter Phillips curve is due to exogenous changes in, for instance, productivity, this 
need not reflect a change in the behaviour of households and companies. The 
possibilities to steer inflation thus need not have deteriorated. Monetary policy 
affects demand and resource utilisation through many different channels. Unem-
ployment is one channel, but labour force participation, employment, and job va-
cancies are some examples of other channels through which monetary policy can 
have an impact. 
However, if it were the case that the flatter Phillips curve is based on a change in 
the behaviour of households or companies, for instance, that companies set 
prices in a different way than before, this could mean that the impact of monetary 
policy also changes.17 It is thus not sufficient to observe that the slope of the Phil-
lips curve has changed to draw any conclusions for monetary policy, one must 
also have an idea of why the slope has changed.   
A lot of things work well in the labour market – but not 
everything 
Economic prospects in Sweden are currently bright. Growth is good, at the same 
time as employment and labour market participation are rising. The labour mar-
ket appears to be functioning fairly well, with declining unemployment. Compared 
with the rest of Europe, things are looking good in several respects. The employ-
ment rate and labour force participation are both high in a European perspective, 
see Figure 7a, which shows the employment rate in Sweden compared with the 
euro area. A large part of the difference is due to the labour supply among 
women and older people being relatively high in Sweden.  
In other words, a lot of things work well in the Swedish labour market from a Eu-
ropean perspective, but there are some challenges. Although unemployment is 
lower than the average for the EU countries, it is not among the lowest, see Figure 
7b. Moreover, we have a marked division in the labour market between those 
born abroad and those born in Sweden. For those born abroad, unemployment is 
16 per cent, but for those born in Sweden it is only 4 per cent, see Figure 8a. Un-
employment among those born abroad is also high in relation to other European 
countries, see Figure 8b. An important challenge for the labour market going for-
ward is thus the integration of those born abroad. 
                                                           
17 See, for instance, Lindé and Trabandt (2019) who show that when the economy is hit by major negative 
changes, companies and unions delay changing prices and wages, which leads to a flatter Phillips curve. Another 
possible explanation for the flatter Phillips curve could be that the central banks’ monetary policy has become 
more effective, see McLeay and Tenreyro (2018).

Increased migration in Sweden and abroad  
During the latter part of the 19th century there was widespread emigration from 
Sweden to the United States in particular. Around 1.2 million Swedes emigrated 
to the United States between 1851 and 1930, which at that time was around one 
fifth of the population. The reasons were in many cases financial, but religious 
freedom and increased equality were also attractive. There were several factors 
that enabled emigration. The emergence of the steam ship was one factor. Liberal 
ideas on economics, politics and freedom – which made a breakthrough around 
Europe in the 19th century – were other factors. 
At the beginning of the 20th century, Sweden was an established “emigration 
country” with more emigrants than immigrants, see Figure 9. This was primarily 
due to the large-scale emigration, but we also had very few immigrants. In the 
year 1900 the percentage of people born abroad in relation to the population as a 
whole was just 0.7 per cent, with most of them coming from other Nordic coun-
tries. An interesting fact here is that the immigrants from outside of Europe com-
prised 90 people from South America, 79 from Africa (56 of whom were from 
  13 [24] 
  South Africa) and 87 from Asia.18 Since then, migration has increased steadily and 
at the end of 2017 the percentage of those born abroad was more than 18 per 
cent. The migration streams can vary substantially from year to year, but the 
trend has been rising and there has been a particularly substantial increase in re-
cent decades, see Figure 9.

Immigration to Sweden follows an international trend with increasingly large mi-
gration streams. Between 2000 and 2017 the total number of migrants in the 
world increased by around 50 per cent. There are roughly around 260 million mi-
grants at the moment, most of whom are from low-income countries. These mi-
grants move at approximately the same extent to low income countries as to high 
income countries, see Figure 10a. Migration from high income countries is much 
less common, but there is a not insignificant amount of migration between high 
income countries. Population mobility has thus increased throughout the world.     
In Sweden, the percentage of people born in countries outside the EU, many from 
low income countries, has increased steadily since the beginning of the 1980s. The 
rate of increase after 2010 is particularly tangible, see Figure 10b. The figure also 
shows an increase in immigration from EU/EFTA and a decline in Nordic immigra-
tion.

Economic effects of migration 
The increasing migration has become a hot issue in recent years, partly due to the 
difficulties in integrating those born abroad into the labour market. The economic 
consequences of migration have also been debated at length. The perspective has 
then often been how increased immigration affects public finances. This is an im-
portant question, but it is not so easy to analyse, as migration can take many dif-
ferent forms. It can be permanent or temporary. It can involve refugees, labour 
immigration or family member immigration. In addition, the reasons for migration 
vary, although they are most often political or financial (in labour market terms). 
All of this is important when evaluating the consequences of migration.  
Labour immigration normally benefits common welfare, on condition that there is 
a redistribution to the groups that might lose out. If the right competence is not 
available within the country, it is important for companies to be able to recruit 
from abroad to maintain competitiveness. It is then not just a question of highly 
qualified labour. Labour immigrants can today be anything from IT specialists and 
graduate engineers to construction workers, assistant nurses and cleaners. 
The consequences of the refugee immigration are more difficult to analyse. In the 
short term, one can expect costs before the migrants become established on the 
labour market. However, there are also more long-term consequences to be con-
sidered. We have a demographic development towards an increasingly ageing 
population and a rising dependency ratio. This means that we can have a situation 
with many old age pensions who push up public expenditure at the same time as 
fewer individuals of working age contribute to tax revenue, which deteriorates 
public finances. Increased immigration can in this context be positive for the age 
composition, as those born abroad have a favourable age structure. Just over 70 
per cent of those born abroad are of working age, which can be compared with 
around 55 per cent of those born in Sweden. A continued inflow of people born 
  15 [24] 
   abroad could therefore keep down the dependency ratio going forward, see Fig-
ure 11.19

A rapid population growth generally promotes economic growth. A large popula-
tion gives increased scope for economies of scale and thereby better capacity to 
introduce new technology that can make production more efficient. It also leads 
to an increased need for investment. From a Swedish perspective, housing invest-
ment is particularly important, as new construction has been slow for a long pe-
riod of time now, although there have been some improvements in recent years. 
However, it is nevertheless important to have further measures in housing and 
taxation policy that increase the incentives to build housing and in particular 
cheap housing. Otherwise there is a risk that the positive effects of an increase in 
population growth will not take place.  
The link between migration and monetary policy is not entirely clear. But in-
creased migration affects the labour market and resource utilisation in the econ-
omy. Increased immigration creates the conditions for long-term higher employ-
ment. If the labour market functions efficiently and the immigrants can be inte-
grated into society this will entail higher long-term production. But there will al-
ways be a transitional phase – which can be shorter or longer – when the actual 
resource utilisation deviates from the long-term level. Monetary policy may need 
to take this into consideration. Moreover, if many immigrants have a low level of 
education, the long-term level will be more difficult to assess, as this group has 
greater difficulty becoming established on the labour market. I will return later to 
how monetary policy should give consideration to increased uncertainty in long-
term trends. 
Another link concerns the collection of statistics. Immigration can be divided up 
into people who intend to stay and people who are in a country temporarily, for 
                                                           
19 See also Olli Segendorf and Theobald (2019) for a more in-depth discussion.  
  16 [24] 
   instance, to fill a shortage of labour. One problem with the official statistics is that 
they in many cases miss the temporary immigration. This can also make it more 
difficult to assess resource utilisation. If the supply of labour is greater than the 
measurement in the official statistics, there is more spare capacity than the statis-
tics reveal, that is, resource utilisation is not as strained as the official statistics 
would imply. An improvement in the statistics in this respect would be desirable 
so that we have a better, more correct, basis to make our monetary policy deci-
sions, for instance. 
Falling long-term real interest rates in Swe-
den and on the global financial markets 
I began by showing that the long-term real interest rate is important to the long-
term level of the policy rate. In small open economies like Sweden, with free 
movement of capital, interest rates are strongly affected by interest rates abroad. 
This means that the long-term real interest rate in Sweden is largely determined 
by interest rates abroad.  
One difficulty in the monetary policy analysis is to calculate the long-term real in-
terest rate, since this is not directly observable. There are many different methods 
for calculating it in the literature, but none that is generally accepted. One way of 
doing it is to calculate the average expected future real interest rate, which pro-
vides a benchmark if nothing else.  
Figure 12 shows how an estimate of the Swedish long-term real interest rate has 
moved since the mid-1990s until now.20 According to this estimate, it was around 
1.5–2 per cent in the middle of the 1990s. Since then, it has shown a downward 
trend to around −1 per cent. This downturn is primarily due to a trend decline in 
international interest rates. Figure 12 also shows that the long-term real interest 
rate has fallen in large and important economies such as the euro area, the United 
Kingdom and the United States. The Swedish long-term real interest rate followed 
the level of the euro area fairly closely until the financial crisis in 2008–2009, after 
which it has been a little higher. 
There are several reason why international real interest rates have shown a falling 
trend. At an overall level the willingness to save has increased more than the will-
ingness to invest, which has meant that the long-term real interest rate has fallen. 
The former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke pointed to the increasing 
saving in China and other Asian countries as one reason for the global increase in 
savings, partly because of deficiencies in the social insurances systems in the rap-
idly-growing countries. The US economist Robert Gordon says that the pace of in-
novation has slowed down substantially since the 1970s and that today’s innova-
tions do not provide the same productivity gains as the earlier ones, which should 
dampen the global willingness to invest.  
Demographic developments affect the composition of the population and can also 
have consequences for saving and investment. We are now heading towards an 
                                                           
20 For a description of the method, see De Rezende (2017) and De Rezende and Ristiniemi (2018).  
  17 [24] 
  increasingly ageing population with more old-age pensioners and fewer children. 
Demographical factors are generally difficult to analyse and there are arguments 
that global saving can both increase and decrease as a result of demographic de-
velopments. Seen in a life cycle perspective, we save the most when we are of 
working age. This is when most of us earn the most and are motivated to save for 
our retirement. The majority of household savings and labour supply therefore 
comes from people of working age. Minors and children have little income and 
consume from their parents’ incomes and therefore contribute negatively to total 
savings. Old-age pensioners also contribute negatively as their labour supply is 
small and they largely live off their savings.

This means that on the one hand lower birth rates, as in China for instance, lead 
to the working age share of the population increasing and therefore to an in-
crease in saving. On the other hand, a large share of old-age pensioners in the 
population leads to a decline in saving. But a larger proportion of old-age pension-
ers in the population also means that the supply of labour declines. This dampens 
the need for investment, that is, the demand for savings declines.   
Another effect of the ageing population is that the average life expectancy of the 
population increases. This means that the working age population need to save 
more to manage a longer period of time as old-age pensioners, which could be an 
important factor behind the increase in the willingness to save. If the saving is in-
tended for use in future retirement, one effect of the falling real interest rates 
may moreover be that many people need to save even more to reach their saving 
targets. 
Can the long-term real interest rate in Sweden deviate 
from international levels? 
On a global level, total saving is adjusted to coincide with the total investment 
need. But this adjustment does not occur automatically; it depends on how 
  18 [24] 
   households and companies choose to distribute their resources over time. In the 
long run, it is the real interest rate that is adjusted so that saving and investment 
become the same. This does not mean that saving must necessarily be the same 
as investment in individual economies. In Sweden, for instance, we can both save 
and invest abroad at the same time as foreigners can save and invest in Sweden.  
The difference between saving and investment in an economy is measured by the 
current account. Swedish saving has for a long time exceeded investment, which 
has resulted in a surplus that has been invested abroad and given rise to relatively 
large surpluses in the current account. One of the advantages with the free move-
ment of capital is that we have been able to save abroad and in this way obtain a 
better return than at home. In the long run, the return should even out and real 
interest rates in various countries and regions converge towards a common long-
term interest rate level.  
We have seen that the long-term real interest rate in Sweden largely follows inter-
national levels, but that there can be some deviations. This could be a sign that 
domestic factors also play some role for the long-term level. One such factor 
could be indebtedness in relation to other countries. If the indebtedness is very 
high in relation to income (production), it is likely that investors will demand com-
pensation for the extra risk that high levels of indebtedness imply. The long-term 
real interest rate in a small open economy like Sweden’s is therefore the sum of 
the global real interest rate plus a risk premium 𝜌𝜌, that is to say, 
A complete adjustment of the long-term real interest rate to international levels 
thus only occurs when the risk premium is zero. In principle, the risk premium 
could be both positive and negative. Small open economies with a very high level 
of saving abroad could have a negative risk premium, which could be expressed as 
a lower long-term real interest rate than the global one. In Sweden we have had 
large surpluses in the current account. This means that we have built up large net 
foreign assets. Given this, our risk premium should not be very high, but one can-
not rule out the possibility that other factors may also affect the risk premium.

Uncertainty over long-term trends – more 
cautious monetary policy 
A large part of today’s speech has concerned long-term levels and trends on the 
labour market and the financial markets. When such trends change, it often takes 
some time before one notes the change and this can also be difficult to assess. 
One example of this is our forecasts of labour force participation. Figure 13a 
shows the forecasts for labour force participation at different points in time, to-
gether with actual outcomes. The forecasts do not appear to have succeeded in 
capturing what appears to be an increasing trend in labour force participation. 
This is partly because we have underestimated the population increase, which is 
based on Statistics Sweden's forecasts, and partly because labour force participa-
tion has risen as a share of the population. The latter could be due to reforms that 
have stimulated the labour supply and an increase in labour supply that is not reg-
istered in the population database. However, the forecast errors can be smaller 
  19 [24] 
   when it is not a question of changes in trends, which can be illustrated by the 
forecasts of GDP growth, see Figure 13b. 
One uncertainty factor in the monetary policy decisions is thus the difficulty in de-
tecting changes in trends, but there are also other uncertainty factors to take into 
account. Alan Greenspan put it like this: “Uncertainty is not just an important fea-
ture of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of that land-
scape”.21 In other words, monetary policy decision-making is surrounded by vari-
ous different types of uncertainty. At the Riksbank we grapple with issues such as: 
Which shocks are currently the driving force behind the business cycle? Which 
forecasting model gives the best forecasts? How large is the effect of a change in 
the interest rate on inflation? What characterises well-balanced monetary policy? 
How should the risk of low inflation be balanced against increased risks for finan-
cial instability? Is the data correct? Should special attention be given to really neg-
ative scenarios?

There has been greater interest in how to take into account uncertainty in the 
monetary policy decision-making process since the financial crisis. This has often 
been about finding a structured way to take into account the uncertainty in the 
monetary policy decision. Unfortunately, I must say that the answer to this ques-
tion is not exactly easy and that it can probably be best summarised as “it de-
pends”.  
In practice, there are three approaches a policymaker can take with regard to un-
certainty. He or she can act more forcefully, more cautiously or as if the uncer-
tainty did not exist. The latter approach is called “certainty equivalence” in aca-
demic research and is a good policy only under fairly restrictive assumptions of 
how the economy functions. It is therefore probably less useful as guidance in pol-
icy-making. Moreover, the central banks’ actual behaviour and communication in-
dicate that uncertainty plays an important role in the monetary policy decisions.

   A more useful approach is probably William Brainard’s insight that monetary pol-
icy should be conducted more cautiously when there is considerable uncertainty 
over its impact.22 Brainard’s uncertainty principle is based on the insight that cen-
tral banks’ actions can affect the uncertainty in the economy. If, for instance, a 
central bank were to act more forcefully to try to attain its inflation target more 
promptly – in a scenario where there is great uncertainty over the impact of mon-
etary policy – there is a risk that it would instead miss the target by a wide margin. 
By acting forcefully, the central bank contributes to greater variations in inflation 
and also to greater uncertainty in general. To avoid this, the central bank should 
act more cautiously. This uncertainty principal is often referred to by central 
banks and can be one reason why central banks, who want to avoid making major 
mistakes in all circumstances, are sometimes perceived as “sluggish” in their be-
haviour. 
One of my themes today has been long-term trends. When such trends change, it 
often takes a long time before one notes the change and this can moreover be dif-
ficult to assess. Brainard’s uncertainty principle can also be applied to this type of 
uncertainty. If there is uncertainty as to whether there has been a shift in a long-
term trend, the central bank should rely more on historical correlations that are 
more certain. The more uncertain the most recent observations are considered to 
be, the greater the weight that should be given to historical correlations and the 
more cautious the central bank should be in its actions.23   
It would of course be practical if Brainard’s uncertainty principle was entirely gen-
eral and could be applied to all types of uncertainty, but unfortunately this is not 
the case.24 Two important exceptions – which have both been applicable to the 
Riksbank’s monetary policy in recent years – are worth mentioning. The first con-
cerns the shift in long-term inflation expectations. We had a situation in 2014–
2015 when expectations began to fall below the inflation target of 2 per cent. In 
such a scenario the central bank should act more aggressively to anchor expecta-
tions to the target. An overly cautious monetary policy risks reducing confidence 
in the target. It was therefore necessary to conduct an aggressive and strong mon-
etary policy that reduced this risk and quickly restored confidence in the inflation 
target. 
The second exception concerns when the policy rate is close to the effective lower 
bound. I am sure you remember that the Riksbank and other central banks around 
the world cut their policy rates very quickly when the financial crisis struck in 
2008. Interest rates were cut faster and more than would have been justified on 
the basis of historical behaviour. Between the third quarter of 2008 and the third 
quarter of 2009, the Riksbank cut its policy rate from 4.5 per cent to 0.3 per cent, 
a cut of 4.2 percentage points in the space of one year. We did not hit the lower 
bound. GDP growth and inflation did fall, but the falls were less severe and not as 
prolonged as would have been the case if we had not acted so forcefully.  
The falling trend in the long-term real interest rate has increased the risk that we 
may hit the lower bound more often in the future, even if we are not sure where

   it lies. In such a situation monetary policy should act more aggressively on nega-
tive impulses. Unconventional measures, such as extensive government bond pur-
chases, may be an important measure.25 
Economists are alternatively criticised for being one-handed or two-handed – ei-
ther we are too one-sided in our considerations and recommendations, or else 
there is too much of on the one hand and on the other hand. I mentioned earlier 
that “it depends” how monetary policy should react to uncertainty. When the un-
certainty concerns long-term trends, monetary policy should act more cautiously. 
But this is not a general principle. If the uncertainty applies to the long-term infla-
tion expectations or to the lower bound of the policy rate, one should act more 
aggressively. There is thus an on the one hand case where one should act less ag-
gressively and an on the other hand case when one should act more aggressively. 
In other words, when it comes to monetary policy it can be an advantage to be a 
two-handed economist.  
Conclusion and summary  
Let me conclude by summarising my main messages today. Firstly, long-term 
trends play an important role in monetary policy. There are above all two trends 
that are of special significance; the long-term real interest rate and the long-term 
sustainable level of resource utilisation. The long-term real interest rate abroad 
has shown a falling trend for a long time and this is one reason why interest rates 
in Sweden and many other countries are unusually low. 
Secondly, the period following the financial crisis was special in Sweden in several 
ways, but also so in other parts of the world. Both inflation and wage increases 
have been lower than expected, at the same time as resource utilisation has on 
average been largely normal and the central banks’ policy rates have been low. 
Commonly recurring explanations for the low and slow development in prices and 
wages are globalisation and digitalisation. But there are also changes in various 
trends in the Swedish labour market following the financial crisis that may have 
contributed to the low prices and wages – an increasing number of people enter-
ing the labour force, compensation rates in the social insurance systems falling 
and employees’ negotiating power appearing to have weakened.  
Developments since the financial crisis 2008–2009 thus indicate that inflation and 
resource utilisation are not governed solely by short-term changes in demand. 
Structural changes and more trend-like changes also play a role. We therefore 
need to give more consideration to such changes in the monetary policy analysis. 
In addition, I have illustrated that the flatter Phillips curve, that is, the weaker co-
variation between unemployment and wages, does not necessarily mean that the 
impact of monetary policy has declined. Monetary policy affects demand and re-
source utilisation through many different channels. Unemployment is one chan-
nel, but labour force participation, employment, and job vacancies are some ex-
amples of other channels through which monetary policy can have an impact. 
                                                           
25 The term “unconventional” may be a little misleading in the sense that, for instance, purchases of government 
bonds do not go beyond the bounds of what central banks normally do when conducting monetary policy. 
  22 [24] 
   Thirdly, changes in trends are often difficult to detect immediately and are diffi-
cult to assess. One consequence of this is that central banks should act more cau-
tiously and rely more on historical correlations that are more certain. This uncer-
tainty principal is often referred to by central banks and can be one reason why 
they are sometimes perceived as “sluggish” in their behaviour.
