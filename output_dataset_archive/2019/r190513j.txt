VENUE:   
  Underlying inflation – for better or for 
worse∗ 
Thank you very much for the invitation to come and speak at the Swedish 
Society of Financial Analysts! 
 
Concepts such as underlying inflation and core inflation are often used in 
discussions on inflation and monetary policy. But what do these concepts 
actually mean? And what do measures of underlying inflation actually 
measure? My aim today is to discuss why central banks are interested in 
underlying inflation and how it can be measured.  
 
I will first explain why we need to measure underlying inflation (or core in-
flation, which I regard as a synonym) and then briefly describe the history 
of the concept. There are two common methods of calculating underlying 
inflation, and on the basis of these I will discuss which properties are desir-
able for measures of underlying inflation. I will also present different exam-
ples of measures. 
 
There are measures that are better or worse with regard to how well they 
fulfil the criteria for desirable properties. But a first conclusion is that there 
is no measure that is unequivocally better than all the others. Although 
there are a couple of measures that are clearly better than others. 
 
A second conclusion is that this shortage of an unequivocal measures 
means that problems may arise for monetary policy decision-makers. On 
the one hand, we need to test our way forward with regard to the available 
                                                           
∗ I would especially like to thank Mårten Löf for helping me with this speech. Charlotta Edler, Marianne Sterner, 
Ulf Söderström and Anders Vredin have provided valuable comments.

   data and look at them from different aspects and for this we need the dif-
ferent measures. But we also need, on the other hand, to be clear and 
transparent with regard to the objective for monetary policy. I would say 
that we have seen examples of this conflict in recent years. It can be prob-
lematic if monetary policy decision-makers talk too much about underlying 
inflation, because the rest of the world can start to believe that the focus 
of monetary policy is shifting from the actual inflation rate to some other 
measure. 
Differentiate between lasting and temporary price 
movements  
 
We need some background to understand why these are important ques-
tions. According to the Sveriges Riksbank Act, the objective for monetary 
policy is to maintain price stability. In 1993, the General Council of the Riks-
bank specified the operational target for monetary policy to be an annual 
rate of inflation of 2 per cent. For a long time the inflation target was ex-
pressed in terms of the Consumer Price Index (the CPI), but since 2017, it 
has been expressed in terms of the CPI with a fixed interest rate (the CPIF). 
In the CPIF the direct effects of changes in mortgage rate have been ex-
cluded. 1 2 
 
The following description of the concept of inflation can be found on the 
Riksbank’s website:  
 
If prices of some individual goods or services rise, this is not in-
flation. Prices of individual goods and services can rise because, 
for instance, it is more difficult to get hold of them. For in-
stance, the price of oil may rise as oil reserves diminish. Such 
price increases are usually called relative price increases and 
are thus not inflation. For inflation to exist there should be an 
increase in the general price level, that is, prices in general 
should rise. And if one is to call it inflation, the price increase 
should be lasting. If, for instance, the government raises VAT, 
this has a one-off effect on the general price level, but does not 
lead to prices continuing to rise. 
                                                           
1 The CPI is calculated every month by Statistics Sweden (SCB) and is intended to measure the changes in an aver-
age Swedish household’s living expenses.  The measure is an aggregate of prices of a number of different goods 
and services. The aggregate is based on how large the proportion of each product or service is in relation to an 
average household’s total consumption costs. 
2 When inflation targeting was introduced during the 1990s there were discussions on whether the CPI was the 
most appropriate target variable. One reason was that changes in the repo rate – via households’ mortgage rates 
– have a direct effect on inflation which then moves in the wrong direction. Interest rate cuts with the purpose of 
pushing up inflation then instead lead to CPI inflation falling further, as mortgage rates also fall. This effect was 
not felt to be related to the so-called underlying inflationary pressures and it was thought to make monetary pol-
icy communication more difficult. This could also lead to a negative effect on inflation expectations. 
  2 [19] 
   
The key concepts in the quotation are “prices in general” and “lasting”. Us-
ing this as a starting point, it is reasonable to try to calculate measures of 
inflation that distinguish temporary price changes regarding individual 
products from more lasting price changes covering several goods and ser-
vices. Most central banks tend to use concepts such as core inflation or un-
derlying inflation in this way.3 
 The concept of underlying inflation began to be used 
more often during the 1970s 
 
Underlying inflation, or core inflation, is a concept that has long been used 
in the monetary policy debate. However, it has received rather more spo-
radic treatment in academic literature. The concept is defined for the first 
time in an article by Schreder (1952), analysing text in a number of articles 
from the JSTOR database (see Wynne, 2008). This was in connection with a 
discussion on the general increase in prices that was expected to happen in 
the United States: 
 
Even those who tend to agree with the concept of a rough bal-
ance between supply and demand (i.e. no inflationary or defla-
tionary gap), point out that there is still a huge money supply—
and that is the hard core of inflation…. 
 
In time, this concept began to be used increasingly often, especially when 
inflation began to rise at a rapid pace in the beginning of the 1970s (see 
Figure 1).4 According to Gordon (1975a), the higher rate of inflation was 
due to a number of factors: That food prices had begun to increase faster 
as a result of supply factors in the United States and abroad, that the oil 
price had risen as a result of production restrictions introduced by the 
OPEC oil cartel, that the Nixon administration had introduced price and 
wage freezes and the devaluation of the dollar in 1971 and 1973. Now a 
need arose to distinguish temporary price increases from more lasting 
ones. 
 
                                                           
3 See, for instance, Rogers (1998) for a discussion of how central banks use the concept. 
4 The next reference in the same text search of Wynne is Sprinkler (1975). He writes: “Recent price increases of 
10-12 percent annually were about double the hard-core inflation”.

In November 1974, when the rate of inflation according to the consumer 
price index amounted to more than 12 per cent in the United States, Mil-
ton Friedman wrote the following in Newsweek:5 
 
 That monetary expansion on the average could be expected to 
produce an inflation of something like 6 per cent a year, not of 
12 per cent. The difference is attributable to nonmonetary fac-
tors, mostly transitory, and so constitutes something of a bub-
ble on the underlying inflation trend. In the past, when such 
bubbles have broken, the rate of inflation has declined precipi-
tously. For example, in the Korean War bubble, the rate of infla-
tion of consumer prices fell from 10 per cent to 2 per cent in 
nine months. 
 
One now began to use different filtered measures in the econometric re-
search literature. Gordon (1975b) calculates an equation where the aggre-
gate selling prices exclude energy and food prices. He motivated his choice 
by saying that variations in food and energy prices, particularly in the be-
ginning of the 1970s, were due to other factors than domestic supply and 
demand.6 7 
 
                                                           
5 See Newsweek, 4 November 1974, p. 84. 
6 See Gordon (1975b), s 622 “But the magnitude and timing of the 1973-74 explosion in energy prices can only be 
regarded as noneconomic and exogenous”. 
7 Another early reference, which presents a more theoretical description of the concept is Eckstein (1981) 
  4 [19] 
   Some calculations had been published earlier, but from 1978 the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics (BLS) started regular reporting of monthly figures for the 
consumer price index and the producer price index that excluded food and 
energy prices. At the same time, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) be-
gan to publish monthly figures for the consumption deflator (PCE) exclud-
ing food and energy prices.8  
 
Back in the early days of the inflation targeting regime, it was part of the 
Riksbank's monetary policy strategy not to allow effects assessed as tem-
porary to influence the actual policymaking to any great extent.9 Since 
then, various ways of measuring underlying inflation have been designed 
and used in inflation reports, in-depth articles, commentaries and 
speeches, for instance. Their purpose has been to describe the inflation 
process and chisel out an assessment of future inflation.10 Various employ-
ees at the Riksbank have also written articles of a more theoretical nature 
on this subject.11  
Two different ways of calculating core inflation 
 
Despite the concept of underlying inflation often being used in central bank 
communication, there is no unequivocal way to describe it. The most com-
mon methods can be divided into two main lines.12 The first involves using 
different statistical methods to exclude, or dampen, the effect of tempo-
rary price changes over time.13 The second involves excluding predeter-
mined goods and services whose prices usually vary a lot. 
 
Let us look at an example of the first type. Figure 2 shows how inflation in 
Sweden has developed since 2011. It shows clearly a falling trend in infla-
tion up to 2014-2015. After that, the trend has been an upward one. But it 
is also clear that there are major variations from one month to the next. In 
other words, there is a considerable amount of white noise in the series. 
 
                                                           
8 see Rich and Steindel (2007) 
9 See, for instance, Andersson and Berg (1995). 
10 See a discussion on its purpose in Heikensten and Vredin (1998).  
11 See, for instance, Nessén and Söderström (2001) and also Apel and Jansson (1999). 
12 There are also calculation methods that are more anchored in economic theory. Two examples are Eckstein 
(1981) and Quah and Vahey (1995).  
13 There is also scope here for methods that entail in a preliminary stage estimating models where current infla-
tion is explained by actual inflation in earlier periods and by a number of explanatory variables. In a second 
stage, one can then calculate which inflation models predict each period in time.

A simple way of getting rid of the white noise and clarifying the actual 
trend is to calculate a twelve-month moving average for the series.14 Figure 
3 shows the results of such a calculation. Now the white noise has been re-
moved and the underlying development is shown more clearly. But it must 
be emphasised that this is the underlying development given the method I 
have chosen.  
 
                                                           
14 First I have calculated the level for a twelve-month moving average for the CPIF. Then I have calculated the 
twelve-month change for the moving average.

The second common method of calculating underlying inflation is, as we 
said, to exclude certain predetermined prices or groups of prices. Perhaps 
the most common measure used internationally is inflation excluding en-
ergy and food prices. Energy prices contribute to more temporary and 
short-term price movements, the same applies to food prices. One reason 
for these price movements is temporary variations in demand. Unusual 
weather can also temporarily affect prices of, for instance, electricity, cere-
als, fruit and vegetables. The risk of excluding entire product groups is that 
prices in these groups may have changed in a more lasting manner.  
 
CPIF excluding energy is an often used index in Sweden. The columns in Fig-
ure 4 show how energy prices have contributed to CPIF inflation. The con-
tribution from energy prices has at times been fairly large (just over a per-
centage point). But one can also see that it does not vary as much from 
month to month if it is expressed as an annual percentage change. A posi-
tive contribution in one month tends to be followed by a positive contribu-
tion the next month, too.

The solid line in the figure is a different way of showing the same thing. The 
line shows the ratio between index figures for the CPIF and the CPIF ex-
cluding energy. When energy prices rise faster than other prices, the nu-
merator (CPIF) increases faster than the denominator (the CPIF excluding 
energy) and the ratio rises. Energy prices rose more slowly than other 
prices during the period 2012-2016. Since 2016, on the other hand, energy 
prices have risen faster than other prices in the CPIF. 
Which properties are desirable for measures of under-
lying inflation? 
 
Which properties are then desirable for measures of underlying inflation? 
Here are some of those most often discussed in academic literature:15 
 
The measure of underlying inflation should have the same average as the 
actual inflation rate. 
 
The average for the measure of the underlying inflation should agree with 
the average of the actual inflation rate. In other words, it is desirable that 
                                                           
15 See, for instance, Clark (2001) for a discussion of this. 
  8 [19] 
   measures of underlying inflation neither underestimate nor overestimate 
the long-term development of inflation, the measure should have the same 
average as inflation. Policy-makers should thus not be guided by an indica-
tor that can be misleading and can lead to conducting a too tight or too ex-
pansionary monetary policy. If the average is the same as for the target 
variable, it makes communication easier. 
 
The measure of underlying inflation should covary with the trend in actual 
inflation and should have lower volatility. 
 
The underlying measure should covary with long-term movements in the 
target variable.16 When inflation has a rising trend, the underlying inflation 
measure should increase at the same pace.17 On the other hand, the un-
derlying measure should vary less than the target variable.   
 
The measure of underlying inflation should say something about the future 
actual inflation rate. 
 
The measure should be forward-looking, that is, say something about fu-
ture inflation. If the underlying measure covaries with the trend in actual 
inflation, this should give some guidance regarding future developments. 
Let us imagine a situation where the underlying measure of inflation is 
higher than the actual rate of inflation. If it is a good measure of underlying 
inflation, it should then show the actual inflation rate rising somewhat fur-
ther ahead.  
 
The measure of underlying inflation should covary with factors that are im-
portant to the development of the actual inflation rate. 
 
It is also desirable that the measure covaries with macroeconomic factors 
that are important to the development of actual inflation, such as the gen-
eral demand situation in the economy. The better the measure succeeds in 
adjusting for white noise, the better it should covary with various explana-
tory factors. 
 
The measure of underlying inflation should be easy to understand. 
 
The underlying measure should be available soon after new data on actual 
inflation has been published. It should also be easy to understand how the 
indicators have been calculated.  
 
                                                           
16 The underlying measure should thus be persistent. 
17 This type of trend is calculated in Clark (2001) with the aid of a centred moving average over 36 months.  
  9 [19] 
   An Economic Commentary published by the Riksbank in 2018 contains a 
study of a number of measure of underlying inflation.18 One of the better 
measures according to the above criteria is based on so-called principal 
component analysis, CPIFPC. This method aims to capture common trends 
among the various price indices for the sub-groups that together comprise 
the CPIF. As a final step, the component is standardised so that it has the 
same mean value as the CPIF. This means that the first criterion is met by 
definition. The other criteria are well met in relation to other measures, 
possibly with the exception of the final criterion, of being easy to under-
stand. 
 
Figure 5 shows how CPIFPC has developed since 1995. It is clear that the 
underlying measures shows less white noise than the original CPIF series, 
but it is not entirely without white noise. At the same time, it is easy to de-
tect the more long-term trends.

   Which consumer prices should be excluded? 
 
The CPIFPC is a measure of underlying inflation calculated using the statisti-
cal method. In this section I show how consumer prices for various groups 
of goods and services have developed since 1995. This is the type of basic 
data needed when calculating underlying inflation with the aid of exclu-
sion. 
 
Table 1 below shows the fifteen components (or price groups) in the CPIF 
that have varied the most since 1995, measured according to the standard 
deviation for the series.19 The results show that prices of coffee, tea and 
cocoa have had the most volatile rates of price increase during the period. 
Table 2 shows the fifteen components that have varied the least. This 
shows that rents have had the least volatile rate of price increase during 
the period.

Note. The calculations are made using monthly data expressed an annual percentage change. The weights for all 
groups included in the calculation add up to 100. 
 
Figure 6 shows the fifteen components with the highest volatility according 
to the procedure above, aggregated into an index (see dark blue line). The 
total weight of these goods and services in the CPIF is close to 17 per cent. 
The red line in the figure also shows an aggregate measure for the compo-
nents with the lowest volatility. Their weight in the CPIF is on average 38 
per cent during the period. The remaining share is also aggregated and 
plotted in the same figure (pale blue line). The series of volatile prices oscil-
lates between 4.5 and 10.1 (14.6 percentage points) measured as an an-
nual percentage change, while the index with less volatile prices amounts 
to between 1.1 and 3.8 per cent during this period of time. 
 
                                                           
20 This component actually only follows prices in the CPI as a whole. 
21 The capital stock index measures the purchase price of the properties (houses and apartments) and improve-
ments such as refurbishments and extensions.

The average for the index with high volatility is 3.0 per cent, calculated 
from 1995.22 The average for CPIF inflation since 1995 is 1.6 per cent. In 
other words, if one excludes the groups with high volatility one obtains a 
measure of underlying inflation that has a much lower average than the ac-
tual inflation for the period of time concerned. And at the same time, the 
average for the groups with low price volatility is also higher than the ac-
tual rate of inflation; 2.2 per cent compared with 1.6 per cent. 
 
It is common to divide the CPIF into separate indices for goods, services, 
energy and food. The prices of these large groups can have different deter-
minants, which motivates sometimes wanting to distinguish between the 
price increases.23 Service prices have the greatest weight among the com-
ponents with the lowest volatility (Table 2).24 There is more of a mixture 
among prices with high volatility, but all energy prices are included there. 
There are fewer services prices in the group with high volatility. 
                                                           
22 The fact that the average for other prices is so low is largely due to the inclusion of the component “home elec-
tronics”. It has an average rate of increase of -14 per cent during the period. 
23 Consumer prices for energy and food are highly affected by the development of commodity prices on the 
world market, which justifies wanting to study these sub-groups separately from time to time. Costs also develop 
differently in different sectors. Costs normally increase more rapidly in service sectors than in goods sectors as 
wage increases are roughly the same in the different sectors while productivity increases more slowly in the ser-
vice sector. 
24 Their weight amounts to a good 70 per cent of the total weight of prices in Table 2.

It is not the same prices that are volatile all the time. Figure 7 plots the vol-
atility of four price indices over time. The standard deviations here are cal-
culated over a moving 36-month period25. The figure shows that volatility 
has different levels during different periods. The prices of Swedish-pro-
duced fruit and vegetables varied more in 1995-2019 than between 2005 
and 2019. The volatility of prices of coffee and cocoa has increased again 
after being quite low over a 15-year period. The price movements on books 
have become much more volatile in recent years.26 The same applies to 
prices for foreign travel.27 The changed volatility can often depend on 
changes in measuring methods. A new way of measuring prices of foreign 
air travel, for instance, has contributed to a new seasonal pattern with a 
higher volatility in recent years.

25 The calculations are based on annual percentage changes. 
26 The price measurement for books was changed in 2007. The new method, where one follows the prices on a 
top list for books sold, probably gives greater variations than the old method where one followed the prices on a 
number of indicator books. The top list changes every month, while the indicator list changed less often. Sales 
are now captured to a greater extent than before.  
27 Foreign air travel was not included in Table 1, but a new method of measuring prices has contributed to a new 
seasonal pattern with a higher volatility in recent years.

   Underlying measures and actual monetary policy 
 
The different measures of underlying inflation give us the opportunity to 
approach the existing data and view it from different angles. But in the 
next step, the measures will be used by policymakers responsible for mon-
etary policy. Here a conflict arises between on the one hand bringing for-
ward various underlying measures and on the other hand being clear and 
transparent about the objective of monetary policy. The conflict become 
particularly clear if one chooses to use measures of underlying inflation 
that systematically deviate from the actual rate of inflation. Or, in other 
words, the poorer the measure of underlying measure of inflation, the 
greater the communication challenges. 
 
I would say that we have seen clear examples of this conflict in recent 
years: In June 2018, analysts at Handelsbanken Capital Markets considered 
it necessary to deny that the Riksbank had changed its target variable in a 
newsletter.28 
 
The Riksbank's focus on CPIFXE in connection with the April 
meeting resulted in questions on whether the Riksbank was 
changing target variable or rudder once again. This is not the 
case. 
 
Another example is from September 2018. Nyhetsbyrån Direkt writes:29 
 
CPIFXE inflation (the CPIF excluding energy), the measure on 
which the Riksbank is currently focusing a lot on, … 
 
I have quoted two examples here but there are more. The measure that 
was intended to make it easier for us to understand and to help us in our 
monetary policy decision-making has instead come to be perceived as the 
actual target for monetary policy. 
 
For my part, I handle the trade-off between taking in other measures than 
actual inflation in the assessment and being clear that CPIF inflation is the 
target for monetary policy as follows. The desirable properties for an un-
derlying measure as I described earlier in my speech are very important to 
me. The underlying measures I analyse are of decisive significance when as-
sessing the development of inflation. And I can say here that CPIF excluding 
energy does not fare well in the competition.

   In my speeches and presentations on monetary policy, I have in principle 
always referred to CPIF inflation. When I have included underlying 
measures, they have never been alone. This has been my way of emphasis-
ing that it is CPIF inflation –nothing else – that is the target for monetary 
policy. When speaking at the monetary policy meetings I have gone a stage 
further. On these occasions I have in principle never discussed underlying 
measures, but focused entirely on CPIF inflation. 
What have we learnt?  
 
There can be a lot of white noise in the time series data used for economic 
analysis. This applies in particular to monthly data. One therefore needs to 
adjust the data for white noise and seasonal variations. 
 
If one wants to analyse the development of inflation, for instance, one 
must make these adjustments. The purpose is to calculate the underlying 
rate of inflation, or, in other words, core inflation. There are largely two dif-
ferent ways of doing this. One is to use more or less advanced statistical 
methods to adjust for white noise and temporary changes. It is also possi-
ble to exclude goods and services groups that have proved to have volatile 
prices.  
 
Today I have presented a number of examples of measures calculate with 
the different methods. There are a number of important properties that 
one wants these measures to have. They should, for instance, show the 
same basic development as the non-adjusted series. There are measures 
that are better or worse with regard to how well they fulfil the criteria for 
desirable properties. But there is no measure that is unequivocally better 
than all the others. 
 
And this is where the problems arise for the monetary policy decision-mak-
ers. There is, on the one hand, a need to approach the existing data with 
caution and to regard them from different perspectives. But at the same 
time, there is on the other hand, a need to be clear and transparent with 
regard to the objective for monetary policy. I have shown obvious exam-
ples of this conflict from recent years. 
 
Another thing that it is important to realise is that what I have presented 
here are different types of decomposition of the development of inflation. 
Decomposition can occur in different ways, I have talked about two main 
methods here, but they both concern decomposition. 
 
It is not a question of basic explanations of the development of inflation. 
Inflation is the result of a very large number of economic agents’ individual 
  16 [19] 
  decisions to change prices. This can be a businessman altering a price list, 
or negotiation between a buyer and a seller, it can be a public procure-
ment, it can be an employee setting prices with the aid of software that 
compares competitors’ prices on-line, etc. Exactly what lies behind these 
decisions, what explains them, is not something we can learn from decom-
position.
