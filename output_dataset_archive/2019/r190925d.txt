Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy 
Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Osaka 
Haruhiko Kuroda 
Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
Introduction 
It is my great pleasure to have the opportunity today to exchange views with a distinguished 
gathering of business leaders in the Kansai  region. I would like to take this opportunity to 
express my sincerest gratitude for your cooperation with the various activities of the Bank 
of Japan's branches in Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto. 
 At  the  Monetary  Policy  Meeting  (MPM)  held  last  week,  the  Bank,  regarding  the  price 
developments in Japan, judged that it was becoming necessary to pay closer attention to the 
possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target  of  2 percent will 
be  lost.  The  Bank  also  made  clear  in  its  policy  statement  that,  while  taking  this  situation 
into account, it will reexamine economic and price developments at the next MPM, when it 
compiles  the  Outlook  for  Economic  Activity  and  Prices  (Outlook  Report).  Today,  I  would 
like to talk about the Bank's view regarding the economic and price developments on which 
its judgment was based and then explain the basic thinking behind the conduct of monetary 
policy. 
 I. Economic Developments at Home and Abroad 
Let  me  start  by  talking  about  developments  in  overseas  economies.  Overseas  economies 
have been growing moderately on the whole, but the pace has continued to decelerate since 
the  start  of  the  year  (Chart  1).  According  to  the  World  Economic  Outlook  (WEO)  Update 
released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in July, growth is forecast at 3.2 percent 
in  2019  on  a  year-on-year  basis,  marking  a  decline  from  the  previous  year's  figure  of  3.6 
percent. Growth in the world trade volume has been decelerating clearly, mainly against the 
background  of  the  increasing  and  prolonged  U.S.-China  trade  friction  and  adjustments  in 
IT-related goods. The diffusion indexes (DIs) for business sentiment of manufacturing firms 
on  a  global  basis  have  remained  below  50  since  May,  which  is  the  borderline  between 
improvement  and  deterioration  of  business  conditions  perceived  by  firms.  Looking  at 
developments  in  major  regions,  the  U.S.  economy  has  continued  to  expand  moderately, 
supported primarily by an increase in private consumption. On the other hand, the Chinese 
and  European  economies  have  continued  to  be  somewhat  weak.  Specifically,  the 
manufacturing  sector in China  has  remained  weak,  mainly  due  to  the  effects  of  additional 
tariffs  imposed  by  the  United  States  and  the  authorities'  measures  to  push  forward  with 
 1 
deleveraging.  As  for  Europe,  production  has  declined  since  the  second  half  of  last  year, 
mainly  in  Germany,  partly  reflecting  the  tightening  of  gas  emission  regulations  on 
automobiles within the European Union (EU), and weaker exports to China also have been 
exerting downward pressure on the European economy. 
 Looking  at  Japan's  economy,  exports  --  mainly  those  of  capital  goods  related  to  business 
fixed  investment  to  China  as  well  as  the  NIEs  and  the  ASEAN  economies  --  have  been 
relatively weak since the turn of the year, affected by the slowdown in overseas economies 
(Chart 2). In addition, weakness in exports and related production is leading manufacturing 
firms to have cautious sentiment. On this point, since the Kansai region, in particular, has a 
strong economic relationship with the Asian economies, such as China,  you may feel such 
developments. 
 That  said,  domestic  demand  has  remained  firm.  Thus  far,  the  effects  of  the  slowdown  in 
overseas  economies  do  not  seem  to  be  exerting  on  domestic  demand  (Chart  3).  Business 
fixed investment has continued on an increasing trend, with corporate profits staying at high 
levels  on  the  whole.  According  to  the  Financial  Statements  Statistics  of  Corporations  by 
Industry,  Quarterly  (FSSC),  the  ratio  of  current  profits  to  sales  for  all  industries  and 
enterprises  has  remained  at  a  historically  high  level.  In  this  situation,  business  fixed 
investment  on  a  GDP  basis  has  maintained  its  uptrend,  being  positive  for  the  April-June 
quarter on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Turning to the household sector, private consumption 
has  increased  moderately,  albeit  with  fluctuations.  This  is  mainly  attributable  to  the 
continued improvement in the employment and income situation (Chart 4). The active job 
openings-to-applicants  ratio  has  been  at  a  high  level  that  exceeds  the  peak  marked  during 
the  bubble  period,  and  the  unemployment  rate  has  been  in  the  range  of  2.0-2.5  percent, 
remaining  at  around  a  low  level  that  was  observed  during  the  bubble  period.  While  labor 
market  conditions  have  remained  tight,  employee  income  has  been  increasing.  Japan's 
economy thus has been on a moderate expanding trend, with a virtuous cycle from income 
to  spending  continuing  to  operate  in  both  the  corporate  and  household  sectors,  although 
exports have shown some weakness. 
  2 
With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue on a moderate expanding 
trend,  despite  being  affected  by  the  slowdown  in  overseas  economies  for  the  time  being. 
The  keys  to  this  outlook  are  the  following:  (1)  the  timing  of  a  pick-up  in  overseas 
economies  and  (2)  whether  the  firmness  in  domestic  demand  will  be  sustained  until  that 
happens. 
 I now would like to talk about the sustainability of domestic demand. Private consumption 
is  expected  to  continue  increasing  moderately  as  the  employment  and  income  situation 
continues to improve. Although the impact of the scheduled consumption tax hike warrants 
attention,  it  is  likely  to  be  marginal  compared  to  that  of  the  previous  tax  hike  in  2014, 
mainly  because  an  increase  in  household  burden  will  be  smaller  and  various  measures  to 
smooth  out  demand  prior  to  and  after  the  tax  hike  will  be  implemented.  In  addition, 
government spending is expected to underpin the economic activity going forward, mainly 
on  the  back  of  an  increase  in  public  investment  accompanied  by  policy  measures  for 
national  resilience  and  of  spending  on  hosting  the  Olympic  and  Paralympic  Games.  The 
sustainability  of  domestic  demand  depends  on  business  fixed  investment.  Business  fixed 
investment has been steady despite the slowdown in overseas economies, and this likely is 
attributable  to  an  increase  in  investment  that  is  relatively  less  susceptible  to  changes  in 
overseas demand and the business cycle, including that  aimed at improving efficiency and 
saving labor in order to deal with labor shortage, that in research and development (R&D) 
for  growth  areas,  and  that  related  to  urban  redevelopment  projects.  In  fact,  in  the  Kansai 
region,  an  increase  is  seen  in  a  wide  range  of  medium-  to  long-term  strategic  investment, 
such as R&D investment in life science, which is the theme of the World Expo to be held in 
Osaka,  Kansai,  and  investment  related  to  the  digitalization  of  automobiles  and  use  of  5G 
network. Also, the redevelopment projects in Osaka are getting underway in such areas as 
Kita  (or  "the  North")  and  Minami  (or  "the  South").  With  regard  to  the  outlook,  business 
fixed investment is expected to increase moderately on the back of high levels of corporate 
profits  and  highly  stimulative  financial  conditions.  Thus,  it  can  be  said  that  the 
sustainability  of  domestic  demand  in  Japan  is  substantially  high.  However,  business  and 
household sentiment could be affected, depending on developments in overseas economies 
and  financial  markets.  In  particular,  if  the  slowdown  in  overseas  economies  lasts  longer 
 3 
than expected, it is necessary to pay attention to the possibility that firms' investment stance 
will become cautious, mainly in the manufacturing sector. 
 Next,  I  would  like  to  explain  the  other  key  point,  which  is  the  outlook  for  overseas 
economies. Although it is likely that  slowdowns will continue to be observed for the time 
being,  the  growth  rates  are  projected  to  rise  somewhat  thereafter,  partly  backed  by  the 
materialization  of  the  effects  of  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  in  each  economy  and  the 
progress in global adjustments in IT-related goods. Thus, overseas economies are expected 
to grow moderately on the whole. As for now, overseas economies are projected to pick up 
in the second half of 2019 and into 2020, which is in line with the projections made by such 
as  the  IMF.  On  this  point,  adjustments  in  IT-related  goods  seem  to  be  moving  out  of  the 
phase of continued deterioration, but there is no clear sign that the global economy will turn 
to  a  pick-up.  Under  these  circumstances,  downside  risks  concerning  overseas  economies 
seem  to  be  increasing  (Chart  5).  Since  both  the  United  States  and  China  have  been 
increasing incrementally the number of goods subject to additional tariffs, the trade friction 
between these economies appears to be increasing and becoming more prolonged. They are 
exhibiting a stance of continuing with the negotiations, but future developments continue to 
warrant  attention.  In  addition  to  the  trade  friction,  uncertainties  concerning  overseas 
economies  include  various  factors  such  as  the  consequences  of  the  negotiations  on  the 
United  Kingdom's  exit  from  the  EU,  the  effects  of  stimulus  measures  in  China,  and 
geopolitical risks in the Middle East. Uncertainties surrounding developments in emerging 
economies  also  are  of  concern.  Thus,  in  a  situation  where  downside  risks  concerning 
overseas economies seem to be increasing, it is necessary to bear in mind the possibility that 
the  pick-up  will  lag  behind  by  longer  than  expected.  The  Bank  judges  that  it  is  becoming 
necessary  to  closely  examine  whether  overseas  economies  will  pick  up  while  the 
aforementioned firmness in domestic demand is being maintained. 
 II. Price Developments in Japan 
Let  me  move  on  to  price  developments.  The  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  consumer 
price  index  (CPI)  has  been  at  around  0.5  percent  (Chart  6).  It  has  been  relatively  weak 
compared  to  the  economic  expansion  and  tight  labor  market  conditions.  While  there  are 
various  reasons  for  this,  it  seems  to  be  affected  largely  by  the  fact  that  the  mindset  and 
 4 
behavior based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have been 
deeply entrenched in Japan, due to the experience of prolonged low  growth  and deflation. 
Thus,  it  is  taking  time  for  firms'  cautious  wage-  and  price-setting  stance,  as  well  as 
households' cautiousness toward price rises, to change. 
 However, the basic mechanism has continued to operate in which a positive output gap -- a 
rise in the level of economic activity  -- results in  moderate increases in wages and prices. 
Let me elaborate on this point. As I mentioned earlier, in a situation where the economy has 
been  expanding  moderately  and  labor  market  conditions  have  remained  tight,  wages  of 
employees  have  continued  to  rise  and  base  pay  increases  have  been  achieved  for  a  sixth 
consecutive year. On the other hand, firms have faced upward pressure such as of personnel 
expenses and distribution costs on prices resulting from an increase in economic activity. In 
this  situation,  moves  to  raise  selling  prices  have  been  spreading  gradually  among  firms 
(Chart 7). Regarding the output prices DI in the Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of 
Enterprises  in  Japan),  the  situation  has  continued  for  seven  consecutive  quarters  in  which 
the  proportion  of  enterprises  answering  that  the  output  prices  have  risen  has  exceeded the 
proportion  of  those  answering  that  such  prices  have  fallen.  This  already  has  lasted  for  a 
longer period than that observed during the bubble period. Firms' stance steadily has shifted 
toward  further  raising  prices.  In  addition,  looking  at  annual  price  changes  across  all  CPI 
items, the share of price-increasing items minus the share of price-decreasing items recently 
has been increasing moderately. Of course, the reason why firms can raise selling prices is 
that households' tolerance of price rises has been increasing, albeit moderately, on the back 
of  improvement  in  the  employment  and  income  situation.  Such  improvement  has  been 
achieved especially  because the economy has  been expanding moderately and the positive 
output gap has been maintained. 
 As for the outlook, it is likely that Japan's economy will continue on an expanding trend and 
the  output  gap  will  remain  positive.  With  the  level  of  economic  activity  remaining  high, 
firms'  stance  is  expected  to  gradually  shift  toward  further  raising  wages  and  prices  and 
medium-  to  long-term  inflation  expectations  of  firms  and  households,  which  have  been 
more or less unchanged recently, are projected to rise gradually. Under these circumstances, 
 5 
the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, 
although this will take time.   
 Regarding this baseline scenario of the outlook for prices, however, risks are skewed to the 
downside.  In  particular,  recently,  slowdowns  in  overseas  economies  have  continued  to  be 
observed and their downside risks seem to be increasing. Thus, it is necessary to pay closer 
attention  to  the  risk  that  the  economic  slowdown  stemming  from  overseas  economies  will 
spread  to  prices.  I  will  elaborate  on  this  point  later  when  I  talk  about  the  Bank's  thinking 
behind the conduct of monetary policy.   
 III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy 
Now, I would like to talk about the Bank's conduct of monetary policy. 
 The  Bank  has  been  pursuing  powerful  monetary  easing  under  the  framework  of 
"Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control," aiming to 
achieve the price stability target of 2 percent (Chart 8). The main transmission mechanism 
of  monetary  easing  that  the  Bank  assumes  is  to  lower  real  interest  rates,  which  are 
calculated  by  subtracting  inflation  expectations  from  nominal  interest  rates.  Real  interest 
rates  currently  are  well  below  the  natural  rate  of  interest,  which  is  neutral  to  economic 
conditions,  and  are  stimulating  a  wide  range  of  economic  activities.  In  this  situation,  the 
inflation mechanism  driven  by  the  positive  output gap  has  been  operating,  as  I  mentioned 
earlier.  In  order  to  achieve  the  price  stability  target,  the  Bank  considers  it  important  to 
ensure  that  the  inflation  mechanism  continues  to  operate  and  thereby  maintain  the 
momentum toward achieving the target. 
 This stance of monetary policy conduct by the Bank basically has not changed from a year 
ago, when I spoke at this meeting last time. On the other hand, monetary policy conduct of 
major  central  banks  abroad  has  changed  significantly  from  last  year's  moves  toward 
normalization.  This  month,  the  European  Central Bank  (ECB)  decided to  lower  one  of  its 
policy rates and restart its asset purchases, and the Federal Reserve also decided to lower its 
policy  rate,  following  the  rate  cut  in  July.  Factors  that  lie  behind  these  decisions  are  the 
prolonged  slowdown in the  global  economy  and  heightening  uncertainties, which Japan  is 
 6 
also  facing.  At  the  press  conference  after  the  decision  to  take  monetary  easing  measures, 
President Draghi of the ECB underlined that, in an environment of prolonged uncertainties 
related  to,  for  example,  geopolitical  factors  and  the  rising  threat  of  protectionism, 
international  trade  had  been  weakening  and  downside  risks  surrounding  the  euro  area 
economy were significant. 
 The Bank of Japan has the same policy stance, in that preventing and insuring against risks 
are  taken  into  consideration  when  conducting  monetary  policy.  In  doing  so,  what  is 
essential for the Bank is assessment of the momentum toward achieving the price stability 
target  of  2  percent.  If  there  is  a  greater  possibility  that  such  momentum  will  be  lost,  the 
Bank  will  not  hesitate  to  take  additional  easing  measures.  While  various  factors  are 
considered when examining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target, the 
following two points are particularly important. First is whether the positive output gap, or 
the high level of economic activity, will be maintained, and whether firms' stance will shift 
toward  further  raising  wages  and  prices  under  such  situation.  Second  is  developments  in 
medium- to long-term inflation expectations of firms and households. Based on these points, 
the  Bank  deems  that  the  momentum  toward  achieving  the  price  stability  target  has  been 
maintained  so  far.  With  the  output  gap  remaining  positive,  moves  to  raise  selling  prices 
reflecting  cost  increases  have  been  observed  recently  in  a  wide  range  of  firms.  As  for  the 
outlook,  inflation  expectations  are  projected  to  rise  as  many  of  the  factors  that  have  been 
delaying inflation will be resolved gradually and moves to raise prices will spread widely. 
Under these circumstances, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase 
gradually  toward  2  percent.  Thus,  the  Bank  judges  it  appropriate  to  continue  with  the 
current monetary policy. 
 However, given that slowdowns in overseas economies have continued to be observed and 
their downside risks seem to be increasing, it is becoming necessary to pay closer attention 
to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost. 
Developments in the output gap warrant particular attention. If downside risks to overseas 
economies  materialize,  there  is  a  possibility  that  the  growth  rate  of  Japan's  economy  will 
decelerate  substantially  through,  for  example,  the  prolonged  weak  exports  and  firms' 
investment stance becoming cautious. If this happens, the momentum toward achieving the 
 7 
price  stability  target  could  be affected  through  shrinkage  of  the  output  gap. Attention also 
should be paid to the fact that the impact of the so-called adaptive formation mechanism is 
large  in  Japan,  in  which  the  actual  inflation  rate  affects  inflation  expectations.  Although 
crude  oil  prices  temporarily  rose  somewhat  due  to  increased  geopolitical  risks,  they  have 
declined  to  some  extent  from  a  somewhat  longer-term  perspective,  mainly  against  the 
background of the slowdown in overseas economies. If crude oil prices decline further and 
the actual inflation rate decreases clearly, inflation expectations also may be affected. 
 Considering that it is becoming necessary to pay closer attention to the possibility that the 
momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost, the Bank will thoroughly 
reexamine economic and price developments at the next MPM, when it releases the Outlook 
Report.  It  will examine economic  and  price  developments  from  a  broad  perspective  at the 
next MPM, based on observations that will be available by the time of the meeting, such as 
various  economic  indicators,  the  reports at the  meeting  of  general managers  of  the  Bank's 
branches, and developments in financial markets. Recently, the situation has been changing 
rapidly, with investors' risk aversion abating somewhat due to  expectations for progress in 
U.S.-China  trade  negotiations.  Let  me  also  add  that  the  Bank  does  not  have  any 
preconception at this point regarding the outcome of its examination. 
 Before  closing  my  speech,  I  would  like  to  elaborate  on  the  Bank's  basic  thinking  on  the 
current conduct of monetary policy. There are three points. 
 First,  the  Bank's  conduct  of  monetary  policy  will  continue  to  be  based  on  the  current 
framework of "QQE with Yield Curve Control," which is highly sustainable and enables the 
Bank  to  make  flexible  adjustments  according  to  developments  in  economic  activity  and 
prices as well as financial conditions. Possible measures for monetary easing include cutting 
the short-term policy interest rate, lowering the target level of 10-year Japanese government 
bond  (JGB)  yields,  expanding  asset  purchases,  and  accelerating  the  expansion  of  the 
monetary  base.  Combinations  or  applications  of  these  various  measures  would  also  be  an 
option.  The  Bank  will  take  appropriate  measures  depending  on  the  situation,  but  in  any 
event, the policy effects will be exerted basically through real interest rates and risk premia 
of asset prices. 
 8 
Second, the Bank considers that the conclusion reached in the Comprehensive Assessment 
released  in  September  2016,  in  which  it  assessed  the  policy  effects  and  their  transmission 
mechanism  since  the  introduction  of  QQE,  is  still  valid  even  in  the  present  situation.  For 
example, there  is  no  change  in  our  recognition  regarding  the  impact  on  economic activity 
and  prices  of  the  term  structure  of  interest  rates,  in  that  short-  and  medium-term  interest 
rates have a larger impact than longer-term rates. On the other hand, the Bank continues to 
take  the  view  that  an  excessive  decline  in  super-long-term  interest  rates  could  lower  the 
rates  of  return  such  as  on  insurance  and  pension  products,  and  this  may  exert  a  negative 
impact on economic activity through a deterioration in people's sentiment. 
 And  third,  it  is  important  to  consider  appropriate  monetary  policy  measures  while 
thoroughly  weighing  their  benefits  and  costs.  As  I  mentioned  earlier,  "QQE  with  Yield 
Curve  Control"  has  been  exerting  its  effects  firmly  by  stimulating  a  broad  range  of 
economic  activities  through  the  decline  in  real  interest  rates.  That  said,  if  the  low  interest 
rate environment is prolonged further, it will become necessary to pay closer attention to the 
costs  of  policy  measures,  including  the  impact  on  the  functioning  of  financial 
intermediation  and  market  functioning.  Thus,  the  Bank  recognizes  that  there  remains  an 
important  challenge  to  consider  what  is  required  to  further  enhance  the  sustainability  of 
policy measures.   
 The  Bank  will  continue  to  pursue  policy  conduct  in  an  appropriate  manner  without 
preconception,  taking  account  of  developments  in  economic activity  and  prices  as  well  as 
financial conditions, while carefully examining various risks. It also will continue to make 
its utmost efforts as a central bank and strongly support firms' activity in Japan. 
 Thank you very much for your attention.

Note: In the right chart, figures for the employee income, Q1 = March-May, Q2 = June-August, Q3 = September-November, Q4 = December-February. Employee income = total cash
earnings ("Monthly  Labour Survey") × number of employees ("Labour Force Survey"). Figures for the "Monthly Labour Survey" from 2013/Q1 are based on corrected figures
adjusted for establishments in Tokyo with 500 or more employees. Figures from 2016/Q1 are based on continuing observations following the sample revisions of the "Monthly 
Labour Survey."
