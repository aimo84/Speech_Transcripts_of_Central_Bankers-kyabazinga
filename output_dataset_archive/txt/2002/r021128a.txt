 Svein Gjedrem: Transatlantic economic partnership - Nordic and American 
perspectives 
Speech  by  Mr  Svein  Gjedrem,  Governor  of  Norges  Bank  (Central  Bank  of  Norway),  at  the  Nordic 
Investment Bank Economic Colloquium, New York, 19 November 2002. 
Please note that the text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation. 
 The Nordic countries and the US have long historic ties. I believe, Mr. Chairman, that the number of 
Norwegians and their descendants living  in the US today  is larger than the population of Norway. I 
think similar numbers can be found for the other Scandinavian countries. I will attempt to show here 
today that even in economic terms, the ties have never been closer. I will mainly concentrate on the 
Nordic perspective, but I also have few specific remarks about Norway.

 The  Nordic  economies  are  small,  open  and  mature  economies.  At  least,  Norway,  Iceland  and 
Denmark  compare  roughly  with  US  income  levels.  In  the  case  of  Norway,  the  income  differential 
against the US is mainly explained by shorter working hours.

 Business productivity growth has been high throughout the 1990s. The chart shows development of 
productivity per working hour in Norway and the US. Unfortunately, I don’t have comparable figures for 
the other Nordic countries. I do, however, believe that they all, with the possible exception of Iceland, 
have had stronger productivity growth than the US over the period.

 Most Nordic countries have large public sectors, reflecting the fact that many services such as health 
and education are produced within the public sector. This is especially the case in Denmark, Norway 
and Sweden.

 Another prominent feature is that, except for Iceland, the Nordic countries have a twin surplus in the 
public sector and on the current account. This implies a net outflow of capital from the region.  
The facts I have mentioned may lead outsiders to regard the Nordic region as one group, made up of 
similar economies. However, there are also some striking differences.

  We differ in our relations to the EU and with respect to monetary policy regimes. Sweden, Denmark 
and Finland are members of the EU. Finland is also a member of EMU. The Danish krone is linked to 
the euro through a fixed exchange rate, while Sweden, Iceland and Norway have inflation targets and 
a floating exchange rate.  
Our financial markets differ in size and structure.

 Government bond markets are generally small, even in relation to GDP. There is, however, a relatively 
large market for private bonds, especially in Denmark. The bond market in Denmark is twice the size 
of the stock market.

 Finland has the largest stock market relative to the economy. This reflects, I believe, the rise of Nokia 
as the world’s leading mobile phone company. We see that the Finnish and Swedish markets have 
followed the US market more closely than the other Nordic markets. 
This also reflects differences in industry structure. The sector composition of the three Scandinavian 
stock  exchanges  provides  an  illustration.  The  Oslo  Stock  Exchange  is  heavily  dominated  by  the 
energy sector, which is practically absent on the other Nordic exchanges. Norway has small traditional 
industries,  but  the  IT  and  telecom  sector  is  comparable  to  the  other  countries’  in  relative  size.  The 
different sector composition of the stock exchanges also illustrates the potential for diversification by 
investing across the Nordic countries. 
The difference in sectoral composition may in part explain the differences in correlation of Nordic stock 
exchanges with the world economy.

 The links with the US economy are many and complex. The US is one of our major trading partners. 
But  the  ties  are  perhaps  even  more  evident  in  the  capital  markets.  All  the  Nordic  countries  have 
relatively large direct investments in the US economy. In addition, US capital markets today have a 
decisive  impact  on  developments  around  the  globe.  American  capital  has  also  been  important  for 
investments in the Nordic economies.

 US companies have been pioneers in developing the Norwegian petroleum sector, which is crucial for 
us. Last year, Norway was the world’s third largest exporter of oil. Even today, two thirds of US direct 
investments in Norway are linked to our petroleum sector.

 Revenues from the petroleum sector have generated an annual fiscal surplus of some 10-15 per cent 
over the last few years. Since 1995, the fiscal surplus has been invested in the Government Petroleum 
Fund. The Fund invests only in foreign markets. Investments – all portfolio investments - are spread 
between  equities  and  fixed  income  instruments,  as  well  as  across  countries.   Approximately  29  per 
cent of the fund is invested directly in the US stock market and in dollar-denominated bonds. 
The size of the fund has increased rapidly over the last few years, and will reach approximately 90 per 
cent  of  GDP  by  the  end  of  this  decade,  according  to  estimates  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  This 
implies further investments of considerable amounts, also in the US market. While the US economy 
has  always  been  an  important  trading  partner,  our  investments  abroad  and  the  globalisation  of  the 
financial system will further increase our interest in the US economy in the  years ahead. The links, 
already important, will expand further.
