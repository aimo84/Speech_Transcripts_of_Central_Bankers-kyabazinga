Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy 
Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Yamaguchi 
Masayoshi Amamiya 
Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
  Introduction 
It  is  my  pleasure  to  have  the  opportunity  today  to  exchange  views  with  administrative, 
financial,  and  business  leaders  in  Yamaguchi  Prefecture.  I  also  would  like  to  take  this 
opportunity  to  express  my  sincere  gratitude  for  your  cooperation  with the activities  of  the 
Bank of Japan's Shimonoseki Branch. 
 At  the  Monetary  Policy  Meeting  (MPM)  held  last  week,  the  Bank  updated  its  projections 
for  Japan's  economic  activity  and  prices  through  fiscal  2020  and  released  them  in  the 
January 2019 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report). Today, I would 
like  to  explain  the  Bank's  outlook  for  Japan's  economic  activity  and  prices  as  well  as  the 
recent conduct of monetary policy, while outlining the Outlook Report. 
 I. Financial and Economic Developments 
The stock and foreign exchange markets saw large fluctuations at the start of this year. The 
Nikkei  225  Stock  Average  marked  the  highest  level  seen  for  the  first  time  in  27  years  in 
October  last  year  but  thereafter  decreased  substantially  in  late  December  through  the 
beginning of January. In the foreign exchange market, the U.S. dollar/yen rate continued to 
be  relatively  stable  throughout  the  second  half  of  last  year,  being  in  the  range  of  110-115 
yen; however, it dipped briefly to the range of 104-105 yen in the early morning of January 
3 amid the low trading volume in the market. Thereafter, although stock prices recovered to 
the  20,000  yen  level  and  the  U.S.  dollar/yen  rate  returned  to  the  range  of  109-110  yen 
through  mid-January,  financial  markets  both  at  home  and  abroad  have  remained  volatile 
(Chart 1). However, as I will explain later, the real economies of Japan as well as the United 
States and Europe have  continued to recover steadily on the whole so far, and the outlook 
for corporate profits has remained firm. Therefore, developments in financial markets in the 
meantime  may  partly  reflect  market  participants  responding  somewhat  sensitively  to 
heightening  uncertainties regarding  the  outlook.  At  the  same  time,  however,  it  is  said  that 
financial  markets  act  as  a  mirror  that  reflects  the  real  economy.  Thus,  it  is  important  to 
carefully  examine  economic  developments  while  also  bearing  in  mind  the  signals  emitted 
by  financial markets. In what follows, I would  first like to explain the current  situation of 
and  outlook  for  Japan's  economy,  and  then  examine  the  risks  to  the  outlook,  particularly 
regarding developments in overseas economies. 
 1 
 To  begin  with,  I  will  talk  about  economic  developments  in  Japan.  The  economy  is 
expanding moderately, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in 
both the corporate and household sectors. In order to grasp the overall picture of economic 
activity,  let  us  first  take  a  look  at  an  indicator  called  the  output  gap,  which  represents  the 
balance between demand and supply in the economy as a whole (Chart 2). While a positive 
output gap shows excess demand and a negative output gap indicates excess supply, the gap 
has  been  clearly  positive  over  the  past  two  years.  Under  these  circumstances,  the  current 
economic  recovery  phase,  which  began  in  December  2012,  has  already  lasted  for  a  long 
period of about six years, almost reaching the longest post-war recovery on record. 
 Next, let me explain developments by economic entity. In the corporate sector, exports and 
production  have  maintained  their  increasing  trend  (Chart  3).  Although  they  were  pushed 
down  by  the  successive  natural  disasters  in  the  July-September  quarter  last  year,  such 
effects  were  only  temporary,  and  exports  and  production  have  turned  to  an  increase  since 
October.  In  this  situation,  corporate  profits  have  been  at  high  levels  and  business  fixed 
investment has continued on an increasing trend (Chart 4). Looking at fixed investment by 
sector,  in  manufacturing,  there  has  been  a  notable  increase  in  research  and  development 
investment  in  cutting-edge  technologies  such  as  self-driving  systems  and  artificial 
intelligence  (AI),  in  addition  to  investment  intended  for  enhancing  capacity.  In 
nonmanufacturing,  investment  also  has  been  increasing  in  a  wide  range  of  fields,  such  as 
that in office buildings accompanying urban redevelopment projects and in the construction 
of  accommodation  facilities  to  meet  demand  from  inbound  tourism.  Investment  aimed  at 
improving  efficiency  and  saving  labor  in  order  to  deal  with  the  recent  labor  shortage  also 
has  maintained  its  high  growth  nationwide.  Such improvement  in the corporate  sector  has 
had  positive  effects  on  the  household  sector.  In  the  labor  market,  the  active  job 
openings-to-applicants  ratio  has  been  at  a  high  level  last  seen  during  the  period  of  high 
economic growth, and the unemployment rate has declined to around 2.5 percent, the level 
observed  during  the  bubble  period  (Chart 5).  Total cash earnings  per  employee  have  risen 
moderately  but  steadily.  Against  the  background  of  improvement  in  the  employment  and 
income  situation,  private  consumption  also  has  been  increasing  moderately,  albeit  with 
fluctuations. 
  2 
 With  regard  to  the  outlook,  Japan's  economy  will  likely  continue  on  an  expanding  trend. 
The  Bank  projects  that  the  economy  will  continue growing  at  an  annual  pace  of  around 1 
percent  throughout  the  projection  period  --  that  is,  through  fiscal  2020.  The  pace  is  about 
the same as the growth rate of Japan's economy that can be achieved in the long term, or the 
so-called potential growth rate, which the Bank estimates to be nearly 1 percent. Our main 
scenario is that Japan's economy will maintain its firm growth for the time being, at a pace 
consistent with its potential (Chart 6). 
 However, due attention should be paid to the fact that downside risks to this scenario have 
been heightening, particularly regarding developments in overseas economies. The baseline 
scenario  of  the  outlook  for  overseas  economies  at  this  point  is  that  these  economies  are 
expected  to  continue  growing  firmly  on  the  whole.  Meanwhile,  there  are  differences  in 
growth  rates  among  regions  compared  to  the  synchronous  growth  of  the  global  economy 
observed  through  the  first  half  of  last  year,  and  uncertainties  regarding  the  outlook  have 
been  heightening.  Similar  views  have  been  presented  by  international  organizations  and 
major central banks. According to the latest forecasts released by the International Monetary 
Fund  (IMF)  this  month,  the  global economy  is  projected to  register  relatively  high  annual 
growth  of  around  3.5  percent  in  2019  and  2020.  However,  these  forecasts  have  been 
somewhat revised downward from the previous ones released in October 2018 (Chart 7). In 
addition, the IMF also has pointed out that the global economy is faced with downside risks, 
mainly due to the effects of the trade friction between the United States and China. 
 With regard to this friction, negotiations have continued between the two countries since the 
turn  of  2019,  but  it  remains  difficult  to  project  developments.  Going  forward,  the  effects 
may spread, not only through a direct impact on trade activities in various economies, but 
also  factors  such  as  a  deterioration  in  firms' fixed  investment  stance  and  risk  sentiment  in 
global financial markets. In addition, an increasing number of developments imply that the 
Chinese economy is decelerating recently, reflecting not only the effects of the trade friction 
but  also  of  factors  such  as  authorities'  measures  to  prevent  overheating  on  the  credit  side. 
Taking into account the timely conduct of fiscal and monetary policy by China, the risk that 
the growth pace of the Chinese economy will decelerate substantially is judged to be small. 
However, as Japan -- including Yamaguchi Prefecture -- has strong economic relations with 
 3 
 China, we will monitor developments in the Chinese economy carefully. In addition, there 
are various other risks originating from overseas economies. Although it is a positive factor 
that  capital  outflows  from  some  emerging  economies  such  as  Turkey  and  Argentina  -- 
which  were  a matter  of  concern  a  while ago  --  have  calmed  recently,  uncertainties  remain 
concerning developments in negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the European 
Union  (EU).  Against  the background  of  such  heightening  uncertainties  regarding  overseas 
economies,  financial  markets  have  remained  unstable,  as  I  mentioned  at  the  outset.  The 
Bank will continue to carefully monitor developments in the domestic and overseas markets, 
including the effects on firms' and households' sentiment. 
 II. Price Developments 
Next,  I  will  move  on  to  price  developments.  The  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the 
consumer  price  index  (CPI)  in  Japan  remained  in  negative  territory  for  15  years  from  the 
late 1990s, with brief exceptions (Chart 8). In order to make a breakthrough in this situation, 
the  Bank  introduced  quantitative  and  qualitative  monetary  easing  (QQE)  in  April  2013, 
embarking on unprecedentedly powerful monetary easing. Since then, Japan's economy has 
improved  significantly,  and  on  the  price  front,  the  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI 
excluding energy and fresh food generally has been in positive territory for about five years. 
The economy is no longer in deflation, in the sense of a sustained decline in prices. 
 This trend can be observed in firms' price- and wage-setting stance. According to the Bank's 
Tankan  (Short-Term  Economic  Survey  of  Enterprises  in  Japan),  the  situation  recently  has 
come  to  take  hold  in  which  the  proportion  of  enterprises  answering  that  the  output  prices 
have  risen  exceeds  the  proportion  of  those  answering  that  such  prices  have  fallen.  This 
occurred for the first time in about 30 years since the bubble period (Chart 9). Also, on the 
wage  side,  the  practice  of  regular  increases  in  base  pay,  which  had  disappeared  under 
deflation,  returned  in  2014  and  has  taken  hold  again  since  then.  Moves  to  increase  wages 
have been spreading steadily, not only among large firms but also small and medium-sized 
firms  in  local  areas.  In  relation  to  this  point,  the  Bank  compiled  the  results  of  interviews 
conducted by its branches in the annex paper to the Regional Economic Report released in 
December, in which it introduced comments by firms in this region as well, such that there 
was a notable number of firms that were proceeding with wage increases in order to secure 
 4 
 employees. Thus, firms' stance  has shifted toward further raising wages and prices, and as 
such developments continue, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase 
toward the price stability target of 2 percent (Chart 6). 
 However, the pace of improvements in wages and prices has remained more moderate than 
expected. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been positive but has stayed in the 
range of 0.5-1.0 percent, continuing to show relatively weak developments compared to the 
economic expansion and the labor market tightening. This is likely to be mainly due to two 
reasons (Chart 10). 
 The first is that prices have not responded smoothly to excess demand stemming from the 
economic expansion. Theoretically, when demand exceeds supply, there will be shortage of 
labor  and  products,  leading  to  increases  in  wages  and  prices.  As  I  explained  earlier,  such 
increases  actually  have  been  observed,  mainly  for  wages,  but  the  pace  has  been  slow 
compared to that of economic improvement. In particular, the rate of increase in scheduled 
cash earnings of regular employees has been sluggish, and it has been taking time for a rise 
in  their  wages  to  fully  take  hold.  The  year-on-year  rate  of  increase  in  hourly  wages  of 
part-time  employees,  which  are  sensitive  to  developments  in  labor  market  conditions,  has 
continued  to  mark  relatively  high  growth  of  around  2.5  percent.  However,  prices  in  the 
services  sector,  which  is  highly  dependent  on  part-time  employees,  also  have  not  risen 
clearly. Regarding the reason why  firms can avoid price rises despite the increase in labor 
costs, it has been pointed out that, in mainly the nonmanufacturing sector in Japan, there is 
large  room  to  absorb  an  increase  in  labor  costs  by  raising  labor  productivity,  primarily 
through  labor-saving  investment.  Technological  progress  such  as  digitalization  in  recent 
years  also  has  partly  contributed  to  encouraging  firms'  efforts  to  raise  productivity.  Thus, 
even amid the economic expansion, there is a combination of various factors that makes it 
difficult  for  wages  and  prices  to  rise.  It  has  been  taking  time  to  resolve  these  factors  and 
such downward pressure on prices may last longer than expected. 
 The second reason why price rises have been sluggish is that inflation expectations have not 
risen easily. Inflation expectations refer to the outlook for prices that firms and households 
assume in carrying out economic activity, or in other words, people's mindset toward prices. 
 5 
 Inflation expectations and the actual inflation rate affect each other. For example, if current 
prices  rise,  firms  expect  that  such  a  rise  will  continue  in  the  future  and  consider  raising 
prices  of  goods  and  services  that  they  produce  and  sell.  In  addition,  if  households  expect 
future  inflation, they  are  likely  to  request  wage  increases  in line  with it.  Thus,  in  order  to 
achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, people's mindset based on the assumption that 
prices  will  not  increase  easily  --  which  became  entrenched  under  prolonged  deflation  -- 
needs to change. However, inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged so far 
despite moderate inflation, and it has been taking time for people's mindset toward prices to 
change, or in other words, for the deflationary mindset to be dispelled. 
 I would like to add one point regarding prices. In terms of the outlook for prices from fiscal 
2019  onward,  some  institutional  factors  that  will  have  certain  effects  on  the  CPI  are 
assumed,  including  the  scheduled  consumption  tax  hike  in  October  2019  and  policies 
concerning  the  provision  of  free  education.  Moreover,  a  reduction  in  charges  for  mobile 
phone services that is expected in the future also is likely to influence the CPI. Regarding 
these issues, two points hold the key from the viewpoint of monetary policy conduct. First, 
what is important is not temporary price fluctuations but the underlying trend in prices. On 
this point, the factors that were raised earlier can be characterized as temporary shocks, and 
as long as this is the case, their impact on the underlying trend in prices as well as monetary 
policy conduct can be assessed as small. Second, having said that, these shocks may not just 
remain temporary depending on the situation. As I mentioned earlier, there is a possibility 
that  people's  inflation  expectations  will  move  upward  and  downward  in  line  with  price 
fluctuations,  thereby  affecting  the  underlying  trend  in  prices.  Giving  due  consideration  to 
these  points,  the  Bank  will  assess  future  price  developments  and  communicate 
developments in such special factors to the public in an appropriate manner. 
 III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy 
Now, I would like to explain the Bank's conduct of monetary policy. As I have talked about 
so  far,  prices  have  continued  to  show  relatively  weak  developments  compared  to  the 
economic expansion and it is also taking more time than expected for inflation expectations 
to  rise.  I  feel  that  an  extended  period  of  time  is  needed  for  a  change  in  people's  mindset 
toward prices, which was formed under prolonged low growth and deflation. Moreover, we 
 6 
 are  in  a  situation  where  we  also  need  to  pay  more  attention  to  the  accumulation  of  side 
effects  accompanying  monetary  easing.  In  order  to  achieve  the  price  stability  target  under 
such  financial  and  economic  developments,  the  Bank  recognizes  that  it  is  important  to 
persistently  continue  with  the  current  powerful  monetary  easing  and  thereby  maintain  a 
positive output gap -- a driver for inflation -- for as long as possible. 
 Based on such thinking, the Bank made two main policy decisions at the July 2018 MPM. 
First, with a view to clarifying its stance to persistently continue with the current powerful 
monetary easing, the Bank introduced forward guidance for policy rates (Chart 11). This is 
a  policy  measure  that  strengthens  market  confidence  and  expectations  regarding  the 
continuation of monetary easing by making clear future policy rates in advance. Specifically, 
the Bank made clear that it would "maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and 
long-term  interest  rates  for  an  extended  period  of  time,  taking  into  account  uncertainties 
regarding economic activity and prices including the effects of the consumption tax hike." 
Second, the Bank implemented measures to enhance policy sustainability and durability. In 
order to persistently continue with the current powerful monetary easing, it is necessary to 
contain the accompanying negative effects, or the side effects. In the first half of last year, 
there was a growing concern that the functioning of the Japanese government bond (JGB) 
market had deteriorated under the Bank's large-scale JGB purchases, as seen, for example, 
in rigid interest rate formation. In view of this situation, at the July  2018 MPM, the Bank 
decided  to  conduct  market  operations  and  asset  purchases  in  a  more  flexible  manner. 
Regarding JGB purchases, while the target level of the long-term yields was maintained at 
around  zero  percent,  the  Bank  made  clear  that  the  actual  yields  might  move  upward  and 
downward  to  some  extent  mainly  depending  on  developments  in  economic  activity  and 
prices.  In  addition,  as  for  purchases  of  exchange-traded  funds  (ETFs),  the  Bank  clarified 
that it might increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions 
while maintaining the annual pace of increase in the amount outstanding of about 6 trillion 
yen. 
 Half a year has passed since the policy decision was made last July. It can be confirmed that 
the  intended  effects  of  alleviating  the  side  effects  have  been  achieved,  and  that  the  policy 
decision also has been effective to a certain extent in stabilizing financial markets. Before 
 7 
 the introduction of forward guidance, quite a few market participants held the view that the 
Bank  would  raise  policy  rates  in  the  near  future,  which  led  to  market  instability  in  some 
cases.  Since  the  July  MPM,  such  view  has  dissipated  rapidly,  and  the  Bank's  stance  of 
continuing  with  powerful  monetary  easing  has  prevailed  further.  Moreover,  the  degree  of 
JGB  market  functioning  has  improved,  as  seen,  for  example,  in  transactions  gradually 
having become more active and price movements having increased. 10-year JGB yields rose 
temporarily after the policy decision in July; however, they then fell into negative territory 
and recently have been stable at around the target level of around zero percent. The pace of 
ETF purchases on an annual basis was around 2 trillion yen in August last year, while such 
purchases marked a high pace of around 10 trillion yen in October and December, when the 
markets  fluctuated  significantly.  Such  flexible  purchases  likely  have  had  the  effect  of 
alleviating market instability in the meantime. 
 Regarding  the  effects  brought  about  by  powerful  monetary  easing,  its  relation  to  financial 
institutions'  profits  and  the  functioning  of  financial  intermediation  is  often  discussed.  The 
Bank is fully aware that prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits, with 
the  low  interest  rate  environment  and  severe  competition  among  financial  institutions 
continuing,  could  create  risks  of  a  gradual  pullback  in  financial  intermediation  and  of 
destabilizing the financial system. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this 
point,  mainly  because  financial  institutions  have  sufficient  capital  bases,  the  Bank  will 
continue  to  make  efforts  to  grasp  the  latest  situation  through  its  on-site  examinations  and 
off-site monitoring of financial institutions and encourage them to take concrete actions as 
necessary. 
 As I have outlined so far, the Bank will pursue powerful monetary easing while thoroughly 
examining both the benefits and costs of its policy effects. In doing so, the Bank will make 
policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and 
prices  as  well  as  financial  conditions,  with  a  view  to  maintaining  the  momentum  toward 
achieving the price stability target. 
 Conclusion 
To conclude, I would like to talk about the economy of Yamaguchi Prefecture.

  Despite  the  temporary  effects  of  disasters  such  as  the  heavy  rain  last  year,  which  mainly 
affected  western  Japan,  the  Bank  judges  that  the  economy  of  Yamaguchi  Prefecture 
thereafter  has  been  recovering  moderately  but  steadily.  There  is  an  accumulation  of 
manufacturing  industries  in  the  prefecture,  mainly  along  the  coast  of  the  Seto  Inland  Sea, 
and  production  and  exports  have  been  at  high  levels,  led  by  chemicals  and  transport 
equipment, where there is favorable demand for high value-added products. Mainly against 
the  background  of  these  positive  developments  in  production,  business  fixed  investment 
also  has  increased.  In  addition,  in  terms  of  tourism,  the  number  of  domestic  and  foreign 
tourists has been on an uptrend, partly because tourist attractions have become more famous, 
mainly owing to the blessed natural landscape. 
 Under these circumstances, labor market conditions in the prefecture have tightened further, 
as evidenced by the active job openings-to-applicants ratio having been at around the levels 
seen  during  the  bubble  period.  According  to  interviews  conducted  by  the  Bank's 
Shimonoseki Branch, labor shortage was pointed out by a wide range of firms, regardless of 
industry. In response to this, I heard that administrative bodies and economic organizations 
in  the  region  were  providing  various  support  programs,  such  as  for  job  seekers  who  live 
outside  the  prefecture.  Firms  also  have  been  undertaking  labor-saving  investment  and 
reviewing working conditions in line with the diversification of workers' needs. Such active 
efforts by the public and private sectors are essential in order for the prefecture's economy 
to overcome the challenge of labor shortage and achieve sustainable economic growth. 
 In the Edo era, Kokudaka -- land value expressed in terms of the estimated amount of rice 
production  --  of  the  Chōshū  clan  in  the  former  Yamaguchi  Prefecture  was  about  369,000 
koku,  which  was  not  necessarily  top  class.  Despite  that  fact,  the  Chōshū  clan  played  an 
important role in the great achievement of the Meiji Restoration. It is  often said that this is 
because  the  prefecture  turned  out  many  prominent  individuals  and  had  strong  economic 
power that substantially outweighed its Kokudaka. The Chōshū clan gathered all its force to 
powerfully promote industries and made efforts to boost production of local specialties such 
as rice, paper, salt, and wax  -- the so-called Bōchōyonpaku. Furthermore, in Shimonoseki, 
which  was  an  important  place  for  maritime  traffic,  an  institution  called  Koshinikata 
 9 
 managed  by  the  clan  was  established.  Together  with  merchants  in  the  prefecture,  the  clan 
actively developed businesses with those on the ships that passed by. These various leading 
efforts significantly enhanced the economic power of the Chōshū clan, and this became the 
driver  for  the  Meiji  Restoration.  I  heard  that,  since  2018,  which  marked  the  150th 
anniversary  of  the  Meiji  Restoration,  efforts  have  been  made  toward  making  Yamaguchi 
Prefecture  full  of  vitality  through  meeting  challenges  to  achieve  restorations  in  three 
aspects: industry, interaction, and living. I would like to close my speech by expressing my 
hope that such positive joint efforts by the public and private sectors will lead to growth in 
existing firms and creation of new work places, and that the prefecture's economy thereby 
will grow further. Thank you very much for your attention.

Reasons for a Rise in Inflation Taking Time

Chart 10
Supply Side
Mindset
 Large room for firms to raise productivity
 Technological progress in recent years
 High wage elasticity of labor supply
 Experience of prolonged low growth and 
deflation
The pace of improvement in prices and inflation expectations has remained slow
compared to the improvement in the output gap.
1. Firms' cautious wage- and price-setting stance
2. Sluggish increase in households' tolerance of price rises
3.
Intensifying competition

III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy
Strengthening the Framework for Continuous Powerful Monetary Easing
Chart 11
(Decided on 31 July, 2018)
Taking more time than expected to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent.
Maintaining the output gap as long as possible within positive territory is appropriate.
Persistently Continuing with Powerful Monetary Easing
Forward guidance for policy rates
"The Bank intends to maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an 
extended period of time, taking into account uncertainties regarding economic activity and prices including 
the effects of the consumption tax hike scheduled to take place in October 2019."
⇒ Strengthening the commitment to achieving the price stability target
Enhancing the sustainability of  "Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with 
Yield Curve Control"
Long-term interest rate: The Bank maintains the target level of around zero percent. While doing so, 
the yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on 
developments in economic activity and prices. 
Purchases of ETFs:        The Bank maintains the annual pace of increase in the amount outstanding of 
about 6 trillion yen. While doing so, the Bank may increase or decrease 
the amount of purchases depending on market conditions.                                  
etc.
