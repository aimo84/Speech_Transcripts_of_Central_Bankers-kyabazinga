Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy 
Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Aomori 
Masazumi Wakatabe 
Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
Introduction 
Good  morning.  It  is  my  pleasure  to  have  the  opportunity  today  to  exchange  views  with 
administrative,  financial,  and  business  leaders  in  Aomori  Prefecture.  This  is  my  first 
meeting  of  this  kind  since  the  start  of  the  Reiwa  era.  Aomori  Prefecture  is  blessed  with a 
rich natural environment such as the Shirakami Mountains, which are registered as a World 
Heritage site, Lake Towada, and the Hakkoda Mountains. It has a long history represented 
by a Jomon clay figurine designated as a national treasure, as well as the Sannai-Maruyama 
Site. It also is an area distinguished by a rich culture that has produced  many intellectuals 
and  artists,  such  as  Shoeki  Ando  (philosopher),  Osamu  Dazai  (novelist),  Shuji  Terayama 
(poet and playwright), and Noriko Awaya (singer). The Bank of Japan's Aomori Branch was 
established in 1946. I heard that, due to a shortage of materials at the time, there were great 
difficulties  in  constructing  the  branch  building.  Since  then,  the  branch  has  operated  to the 
present owing to support from people in the region. I would like to take this opportunity to 
express my sincere gratitude for your cooperation with the activities of the branch. 
 Today, I would like to hear your views on the current status of the local economy, as well as 
your  candid  opinions  about  the  Bank's  policies  and  activities.  First,  I  will  briefly  explain 
developments  in  Japan's  economic  activity,  and  then  talk  about  the  Bank's  conduct  of 
monetary  policy,  regional  financial  institutions  in  Japan,  and  economic  developments  in 
Aomori Prefecture. 
 I. Economic Developments 
A. Economic Improvement since 2013 
First,  I  would  like  to  take  a  look  at  how  Japan's  economy  has  changed  under  quantitative 
and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) that the Bank introduced in April 2013. 
 Looking back, Japan's economy suffered a significant downturn due to the Global Financial 
Crisis  in  2008,  and  thereafter  remained  below  the  pre-crisis  level  until  around  2012.  In 
contrast, since 2013, it has followed an improving trend under the Bank's monetary easing, 
albeit  with  fluctuations  (Chart  1).  Domestic  demand  such  as  private  consumption  and 
business fixed investment has been increasing more considerably than the previous recovery 
phase  of  around  2002-2008,  despite  slower  growth  in  external  demand  (Chart  2).  This 
 1 
suggests that, even amid a weaker tailwind from overseas, well-balanced economic growth 
has materialized as domestic demand has been stimulated strongly, partly by various policy 
measures.   
 The  well-balanced  growth  of  Japan's  economy  since  2013  also  can  be  evidenced  by  an 
improvement  in  the  employment  and  income  situation.  Labor  market  conditions  have 
continued to tighten steadily in Japan, with the active job openings-to-applicants ratio rising 
to the level seen in the 1970s and the unemployment rate declining to the level observed in 
the early 1990s (Chart 3). A notable feature of such improvement is a substantial increase in 
the  numbers  of  employed  persons  and  employees.  This  shows  that  tight  labor  market 
conditions in the current phase are attributable to an increase in labor demand, rather than 
to a decrease in labor supply that results from a  decline in the working-age population. If 
labor market conditions had tightened, due mainly to a decline in labor supply, the number 
of  employees  would  have  declined  since  the  number  of  those  who  wish  to  work  would 
decrease  with  wages  unchanged  and  the  labor  supply  curve  would  shift  to  the  left  (Chart 
4).1  In reality, the number of employees has continued to increase, along with a moderate 
rise  in  wages,  and  therefore  employee  income  has  continued  to  register  relatively  high 
growth.  Such  improvement  in  the  employment  and  income  situation,  together  with 
generally favorable corporate profits, has supported solid domestic demand. 
 B. Effects of the Monetary Easing 
I  think  that  the  Bank's  monetary  easing  has  contributed  greatly  to  achieving  economic 
growth, in which domestic and external demand have increased in a well-balanced manner 
                                                   
1  Compared  to  the  fact  that  the  numbers  of  employed  persons  and  employees  have  increased 
significantly  since  2013,  wage  increases  have  been  relatively  weak.  This  suggests  that  the  labor 
supply  curve  could  have  shifted  to  the  right  --  the  direction  indicating  that  the  labor  supply  has 
increased. Although the continued decline in the working-age population aged 15-64 can contribute 
to  shifting  the  labor  supply  curve  to  the  left,  there  is  a  possibility  that  mainly  women  and  seniors 
have become more willing to work, due to the progress in labor market reform that enabled various 
working  styles,  the  extension  of  healthy  life  expectancy,  and  the  rise  in  expectations  that  labor 
market conditions will remain tight. Firms seem to be addressing demographic changes including the 
declining birthrate and aging population proactively by, for example, taking various steps to secure 
their  labor  force  and  expanding  labor-saving  investment,  rather  than  merely  considering  these 
changes as constraints.

accompanied by the improvement in the employment and income situation. In what follows, 
I  will  explain  the  effects  of  the  monetary  easing  since  2013,  by  describing  changes  in 
financial conditions and its impact on economic and price developments. 
 Let me start with the changes in financial conditions. Since the introduction of QQE in 2013, 
Japan's interest rates have declined significantly. The decline in interest rates has stimulated 
the  private  sector's  credit  demand  and  improved  financial  institutions'  lending  attitudes. 
These have resulted in a clear increase in the amount outstanding of funding in the private 
sector  (Chart  5).  There  is  considerable  evidence  that  the  financing  environment  for  firms 
has improved considerably under the monetary easing. 
 I will move on to the effects of the monetary easing on economic activity and prices. It can 
be  said  that  it  has  led  to  an  upturn  in  the  economic  and  price  situation  by,  for  example, 
producing  accommodative  financial  conditions  and  influencing  people's  expectations,  as 
well  as  through  a  resultant  rise  in  asset  prices.  Since  the  actual  economic  and  price 
conditions  are  subject  to  various  factors,  it  is  not  easy  to  quantify  the  effects  of  the 
monetary easing alone. That being said, let me introduce one simulation of how economic 
activity  and  prices  would  have  developed  since  2013  if  the  Bank's  QQE  had  not  been 
introduced  (Chart  6).  Although  the  estimation  results  should  be  interpreted  with  a  certain 
latitude, this analysis suggests that (1) QQE has strongly stimulated economic activity and 
prices  through,  for  example,  a  decline  in  interest  rates,  and  (2)  without  QQE,  it  is  highly 
likely that the current situation where Japan's economy is no longer in deflation could not 
have been achieved amid a continuous shortage in demand.2 
                                                    
2  The simulation shown in Chart 6 is based on a vector auto-regressive (VAR) model consisting of 
the following variables: the monetary base, interest rates for different maturities, the output gap, the 
consumer  price  index  (CPI)  excluding  fresh  food  and  energy,  and  the  foreign  exchange  rate.  The 
future path of the output gap and the CPI was simulated assuming that there had not been any shocks 
on  interest rates  or  the  monetary base. The  results are generally consistent  with  those presented in 
the Bank's Comprehensive Assessment  released in September 2016, which estimated the effects of 
QQE on economic and price developments based on a large-scale semi-structural  model of Japan's 
economy. 
 3 
The  effects  of  the  monetary  easing  are  exerted  so  indirectly  through  mainly  interest  rates 
that people cannot feel them easily. However, I would like to emphasize that the monetary 
easing  in  fact  has  been  underpinning  the  economy  firmly  from  various  aspects  as  I 
explained earlier. 
 C. Current Situation and Outlook for Japan's Economy 
I  have  described  so  far  that  Japan's  economy  has  been  on  an  improving  trend  since  2013 
under  the  Bank's  monetary  easing.  However,  exports  and  production  have  been  relatively 
weak since early this year amid growing concern about deceleration in overseas economies 
(Chart 7). 
 On this point, the Bank currently assesses that Japan's economy has maintained its moderate 
expanding  trend,  although  exports  and  production  have  been  affected  by  the  slowdown  in 
overseas  economies.  The  monetary  easing  has  been  sustaining  steady  domestic  demand. 
Also,  as  for  the  outlook,  the  main  scenario  is  that  the  economy  is  likely  to  continue 
expanding  moderately  as  a  trend,  with  the  growth  rates  of  overseas  economies  rising 
somewhat and domestic demand maintaining its firmness (Chart 8). 
 More  recently,  however,  further  attention  needs  to  be  paid  to  downside  risks  to  the  main 
scenario.  The  latest  economic  outlooks  by  international  organizations  such  as  the 
International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  also  have  pointed  out  that,  although  the  global 
economic growth rate is projected to increase somewhat from the second half of 2019, this 
scenario  entails  substantial  uncertainties.  Most  notably,  the  trade  friction  between  the 
United  States  and  China  involves  significant  issues  beyond  mere  economic  problems  -- 
such  as  the  competition  in  advanced  technologies  and  national  security  --  and  it  may  be 
difficult  to  resolve  these  issues  fundamentally  in  a  short  period  of  time.  The  negotiation 
between the two countries is still underway, so we should not be too pessimistic. If the trade 
friction  becomes  prolonged  or  persistent,  however,  downward  pressure  on  the  global 
economy  may  heighten  not  only  through  the  direct  effects  of  the  tariff  hikes  but  also 
 4 
deterioration in firms' fixed investment stance and financial market sentiment.3  In Europe, 
uncertainties  over  political  developments  including  negotiations  on  the  United  Kingdom's 
exit  from  the  European  Union  (EU)  remain  high,  and  in  the  Middle  East,  for  example, 
geopolitical risks warrant careful attention. 
 If  the  slowdown  in  overseas  economies  becomes  prolonged,  downward  pressure  on 
domestic  demand  may  strengthen  gradually.  In  addition,  there  remains  a  risk  that  the 
scheduled  consumption  tax  hike  this  October  may  push  down  domestic  demand  and 
eventually economic activity and prices. 
 II. Conduct of Monetary Policy 
A. Why Is the Price Stability Target of 2 Percent Necessary? 
Next, I will talk about our conduct of monetary policy. The Bank has conducted monetary 
easing policy with a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. At my previous 
meeting with business leaders held in Niigata last December, I elaborated on why the Bank 
has set the price stability target at 2 percent.4  Setting the target level at 2 percent is a global 
standard; if we lowered the target, deflationary pressure would be exerted through changes 
in  people's  expectations  as  well  as  in  foreign  exchange  rates  and  asset  prices.  In  addition, 
the Bank does not consider it sufficient if only prices go up; rather, it thinks that achieving 
the  2  percent  target  contributes  to  the  sound  development  of  the  national  economy  --  for 
example, increases  in  nominal  GDP,  corporate  profits,  household  income,  and  the  number 
of  employees,  as  well  as  fiscal  soundness.  A  rise  in  labor  costs  has  been  pointed  out  in 
recent years as one of the factors behind price rises. Labor costs are, in other words, wages 
and salaries. Increases in wages and salaries will lead to price rises, but it also is true that 
                                                   
3  According to the G-20 Surveillance Note written by IMF staff this June, it is estimated that global 
GDP is likely to be lower by 0.5 percent in 2020,  taking into account  the impact of  an increase in 
tariffs  on  200  billion  dollars'  worth  of  United  States  imports  from  China  from  10  percent  to  25 
percent,  the  possible  25  percent  tariff  on  the  roughly  267  billion  dollars'  worth  of  United  States 
imports  from  China,  and 
the  tariff  hikes  already  conducted 
in  2018.  For  details,  see

firms are not able to raise wages and salaries in a situation where they cannot increase the 
prices of their products and services. 
 In  this  speech,  I  would  like  to  explain  the  Bank's  monetary  policy  from  a  somewhat 
different  perspective.  The  Reiwa era  has  just  started.  Most  of  the  Heisei  era,  which  lasted 
from January 1989 to April 2019,  was one of deflation, and  marked by a battle against  it. 
Unfortunately,  economic activity  also  stagnated  during  that  period. While  there  have  been 
various views to explain what caused deflation, we have to note with the utmost seriousness 
that only Japan fell into prolonged deflation among advanced economies, the rest of which 
achieved inflation of around 2 percent for most of the time.5 
 However, under the Bank's price stability target of 2 percent, Japan's economy is no longer 
in deflation. Since the introduction of QQE in April 2013 in particular, the inflation rate on 
average has increased from around 0.5 percent in negative territory to around 0.5 percent in 
positive  territory.  This  improvement  was  achieved  under  the  Bank's  clear  commitment  to 
the 2 percent target and the monetary easing pursued in line with it (Chart 9). 
 B. Cause of Low Interest Rates: Decline in the Natural Rate of Interest 
That  being  said,  the  inflation  rate  has  not  yet  reached  2  percent,  being  in  the  range  of 
0.5-1.0  percent  when  excluding  fresh  food,  and  therefore  the  Bank's  monetary  easing  has 
continued  for  a  long  period  of  time.  In  this  situation,  there  are  requests  for higher  interest 
rates. Some may think that the Bank can raise interest rates because it can control them as it 
wants. But the reality is not that simple.6

"Why Are Interest Rates So Low? Causes and Implications," remarks at the Economic Club of New 
York, October 17, 2016, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/fischer20161017a.htm.

Why  have  interest  rates  remained low  in the  first place?  Interest  rates  are  low  not  only  in 
Japan but in other advanced economies. In economics, it is said that if you want to raise a 
rate, cut it first; if you want to cut a rate, raise it first. A central bank lowers interest rates 
when  the  economy  slips  into  a  downturn  with  a  higher  risk  of  deflation.  Then,  as  the 
inflation rate goes up, reflecting the economic recovery, a central bank raises interest rates 
accordingly. 
 Let  me  elaborate  on  this. Monetary  policy  today  is  based  on  the  following  understanding. 
The  level  of  the  interest  rate  that  balances  savings  and  investment  and  neither  accelerates 
nor  decelerates  the  economy  is  called  the  natural  rate  of  interest,  or  the  equilibrium  real 
interest rate. A central bank conducts monetary policy using the natural rate of interest as a 
reference point. Specifically, at a time of an economic downturn, a central bank stimulates 
the economy by guiding the actual interest rate to a level below the natural rate of interest. 
When the economy is overheated, a central bank raises the interest rate to a level above the 
natural rate of interest. 
 As  the  natural  rate  of  interest  is  just  an  estimate  based  on  a  theoretical  model  and  entails 
uncertainties,  it  should  be  interpreted  with  a  certain  latitude.7  With  this  in  mind,  I  would 
say that the natural rates of interest  have declined in many advanced economies including 
Japan (Chart 10).   
 In the case of Japan, the natural rate of interest declined sharply in the early 1990s. In other 
advanced  economies,  the  rates  have  decreased  since  the  Global  Financial  Crisis.  This 
suggests that the natural rates of interest have been affected by the bubble burst as well as 
financial  and  economic  crises.  Generally  speaking,  the  reason  behind  a  decline  in  the 
natural  rate  of  interest  is  one  of  the  following:  an  increase  in  savings,  a  decrease  in

investment, or a combination of these two. For example, when households and firms seek to 
increase their savings in the event of an economic crisis, the supply of funds in the economy 
will increase and the natural rate of interest will decline. If growth expectations deteriorate 
due  partly  to  an  economic  crisis  or  a  decrease  in  productivity,  and  thereby  firms  become 
less  willing  to  make  investment,  actual  investment  will  decrease  and  the  natural  rate  of 
interest consequently will decline. Demographic changes such as the declining birthrate and 
aging population also are pointed out as causes of the decline in the natural rate of interest.8 
Moreover,  some  say  that  a  global  saving  glut  plays  a  major  role  and  others  point  to  the 
possibility of "secular stagnation."9 
 In a case where the natural rate of interest declines for any reason, a central bank needs to 
lower interest rates accordingly because otherwise the economy will be under deflationary 
pressure. In Japan, short-term nominal interest rates already have reached close to 0 percent 
since the 1990s. In light of this situation, the Bank has taken such measures as (1) lowering 
long-term  interest  rates  through  purchases  of  Japanese  government  bonds  (JGBs),  (2) 
introducing  a  negative  interest  rate  policy  to  guide  short-term  nominal  interest  rates  to 
negative  territory,  (3)  adopting  an  inflation-overshooting  commitment,  under  which  the 
Bank will continue expanding the monetary base  until the  year-on-year rate of increase in 
the observed CPI exceeds 2 percent and stays above that level in a stable manner, and (4) 
                                                   
8  The following study examines the effects of demographic changes on the natural rate of interest. 
Assuming  that  a  decline  in  labor  force  lowers  the  economic  growth  rate  and  that  the  extension  of 
longevity  results  in  an  increase  in  savings,  this  study  estimates  that  about  270  basis  points  can  be 
attributed to demographic changes out of the 640 basis points decline in real interest rates over the 
past 50 years in Japan.  Nao  Sudo and Yasutaka Takizuka,  "Population Aging and the Real Interest 
Rate  in  the  Last  and Next  50  Years:  A Tale Told  by  an  Overlapping Generations  Model,"  Bank  of 
Japan  Working  Paper  Series,  no.18-E-1,  January  2018,  https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev 
/wps_2018/data/wp18e01.pdf. However, attention should be paid to the fact that the study does not 
take  into  account  the  effects  of  financial  crises  as  factors  causing  a  decline  in  the  natural  rate  of 
interest. 
9  Secular stagnation refers to a situation where aggregate demand in an economy remains below its 
potential  supply  capacity  for  a  long  time,  resulting  in  a  further  decline  in  the  capacity.  For  more 
details on the decline in the natural rate of interest and secular stagnation, see a collection of papers 
by  Lawrence  H.  Summers,  Ben  S.  Bernanke,  Paul  Krugman,  and  Alvin  H.  Hansen  in  Keiki  no 
kaifuku  ga  kanjirarenai  no  wa  nazeka:  Chōki  teitai  ronsō,  ed.  and  trans.  Hiroo  Yamagata  (Kyoto:

introducing  forward  guidance  stating  that  the  Bank  intends  to  maintain  the  current 
extremely low levels of  short- and long-term interest rates  for an extended period of time. 
Once  an  economy  falls  into  deflation,  households  and  firms  will  strengthen  their 
expectations that deflation may continue. Especially when deflation lasts for a long time as 
in  Japan,  such  expectations  will  heighten  further.  In  that  case,  firms  and  households  will 
perceive interest rates as higher than the actually low level of nominal interest rates. We call 
such  perceived  interest  rates,  which  take  into  account  inflation  expectations,  real  interest 
rates.  The  Bank's  price  stability  target  of  2  percent  is  expected  to  encourage  firms  and 
households to strongly hold expectations that prices will rise steadily, resulting in a decline 
in real interest rates. 
 The  word  "normalization"  is  often  used  with  regard  to  monetary  policy,  but  it  is  an 
ambiguous term with an unclear definition. The ultimate objective of monetary policy is the 
sound development of the national economy. In other words, it is not until the economic and 
price situation is normalized that monetary policy also will be normalized.10  The Bank will 
continue with the monetary easing for as long as it is necessary to achieve the price stability 
target of 2 percent in a sustainable manner.   
 C. Discussions over the Monetary Policy Framework 
Amid  low  interest  rates  and  low  inflation  observed  globally,  central  banks  and  academics 
have  had  discussions  that  mainly  regard  the  monetary  policy  framework.  The  Bank  of 
Canada  reviews  its  monetary  policy  framework  every  five  years;  the  Federal  Reserve 
                                                   
10  Arguments  for  raising  interest  rates  include  the  "theory  of  ammunition."  According  to  this,  a 
central bank should raise interest rates in advance -- as if loading a gun with ammunition -- because 
otherwise it cannot lower interest rates when the next economic downturn occurs. Of course, when 
the  price  stability  target  is  achieved  in  a  sustainable  manner,  interest  rates  are  likely  to  increase 
reflecting  inflation.  However,  interest  rate  hikes  before  the  price  stability  target  is  achieved  will 
instead bring about an economic downturn, which will be counterproductive. 
 9 
recently  has  discussed  whether  to  update  its  framework.11  Key  points  of  such  discussions 
including these can be summarized as the following.12 
 First, through the experience of Japan's battle against deflation and the U.S. and  European 
economies  following  the  Global  Financial  Crisis,  policy  tools  such  as  QQE,  a  negative 
interest rate policy, and forward guidance have been added to the central banks' "arsenal." 
They will be used going forward depending on the situation. 
 Second,  the  inflation  target  framework  has  been  proved  effective  even  in  the  time  of  the 
Global Financial Crisis and its aftermath, but it has been pointed out that, even in the United 
States,  where  economic  and  price  developments  are  relatively  firm,  interest  rates  have 
remained  lower  and  room  for  monetary  policy  response  has  become  smaller  than  before. 
Under  these  circumstances,  there  are  ongoing  debates  in  the  United  States  and  other 
economies on what monetary policy framework should be adopted with a view to achieving 
the medium- to  long-term  price  stability.  Various  approaches  have  been  proposed,  such as 
setting  a  higher  inflation  target  and  introducing  average  inflation  targeting,  price-level 
targeting, the inflation target range, and nominal GDP targeting (Chart 11). Every approach 
has its own advantages and challenges. Of course, Japan cannot be treated the same as other 
economies such as the United States, where the inflation rate is already at around 2 percent. 
The Bank judges at present that it is appropriate to maintain the current policy framework in 
which it clearly commits to the price stability target of 2 percent and pursues the monetary 
easing  to  achieve  the  target.  That  being  said,  I  think  it  is  necessary  for  the  Bank  to  work 
sufficiently on studies toward better monetary policy.

12  With regard to the challenges of and outlook for monetary policy at present, the following paper 
by  Ben  S.  Bernanke,  former  Chair  of  the  Federal  Reserve,  is  informative.  See  Ben  S.  Bernanke, 
"Monetary  Policy  in  a  New  Era,"  in  Evolution  or  Revolution?  Rethinking  Macroeconomic  Policy

Press, 2019), pp.3-48.

III. Regional Financial Institutions in Japan 
Next, I would like to talk about regional financial institutions in Japan. Needless to say, they 
play an extremely useful role in regional economies. With accommodative monetary policy 
lasting for a long period of time, the challenges faced by the regional financial institutions 
in  Japan  and  the  impact  of  such  monetary  policy  on  them  have  come  to  draw  attention. 
Japan's financial system can be characterized as follows. First, indirect financing has  been 
dominant. Indirect financing is a form of finance  in which depositary financial institutions 
such  as  banks  play  a  significant  role  in  firms'  funding.  Second,  particularly  in  regional 
financial institutions, the ratio of deposits to overall financial liabilities is high while that of 
corporate  bonds  and  equities  is  low.  Third,  regional  financial  institutions  in  particular 
depend on deposit-taking and lending activities. 
 However,  financial  institutions,  not  only  in  regions  but  in  Japan  as  a  whole,  are  now 
entering  a  phase  of  drastic  changes.  Structural  changes  are  taking  place,  such  as  the 
declining  population  and  aging,  globalization,  as  well  as  technological  innovation 
evidenced  by  new  entries  to  the  settlement  business  from  outside  the  financial  sector. 
National  accounts  data  show  that  the  corporate  sector  has  become  a  net  lender  of  funds 
since  the  mid-1990s  (Chart  12).  This  also  is  related  to  the  decline  in  the  natural  rate  of 
interest that I mentioned earlier. Even among small and medium-sized firms, the ratio of the 
so-called  de  facto  debt-free  firms  --  defined  as  firms  with  cash  and  deposits  that  exceed 
their  total  amount  of  borrowings  --  has  continued  to  increase,  recently  exceeding  40 
percent.13 
 Structural  factors  such  as  these  lie  behind  the  decline  in  financial  institutions'  profits. 
Interest rates used to be high worldwide, reflecting high inflation and  high natural rates of 
interest. However, unfortunately, it is unlikely for such an environment to be realized again 
soon. At regional financial institutions, although net income has remained high in the long 
run,  pre-provision  net  revenue  (PPNR)  has  continued  to  follow  a  declining  trend.  The 
Financial System Report released this April shows profit simulation for the next 10 years. 
The  results  suggest  that  more  than  half  of  domestic  regional  banks  are  expected  to  run

deficits in 10 years if the borrowing demand of the corporate sector continues to decline at 
the  same  pace  as  in  the  past.  Of  course,  it  should  be  noted  that  these  results  need  to  be 
interpreted with a latitude as they are calculated based on certain assumptions (Chart 13). 
 Here, it is worth referring  to the case of financial institutions in Europe, where a negative 
interest rate policy has been introduced, as in Japan. The Financial System Report compares 
financial  institutions  in  Europe  with  those  in  Japan.  Under  a  negative  interest  rate  policy, 
the former have made higher profits than the latter. This is partly because funding costs of 
financial institutions in Europe have decreased against the background that the low interest 
rate environment has lasted for a shorter period than in Japan, and therefore there has been 
room  for  a  further  decline  in  deposit  interest  rates.  Also,  in  Europe,  the  share  of  deposit 
funding  to  overall  financial  liabilities  is  low,  and  the  costs  of  market  financing  such  as 
issuing  corporate  bonds  have  been  declining.  Moreover,  financial  institutions  in  Europe 
have secured various sources of revenue  that are unsusceptible to changes in interest rates 
by, for example, diversifying fees on services (Chart 14). 
 For higher profitability going forward, it is hoped that regional financial institutions will (1) 
set  lending  rates  that  reflect  risks  appropriately,  (2)  depart  from  excessive  dependence  on 
deposit-taking and lending activities by, for example, increasing fee-based income, and (3) 
drastically  improve  their  business  efficiency. 14  To  push  forward  with  these  initiatives 
strongly  and  effectively,  the  use  of  digital  technology,  integration  or  partnering  among 
financial institutions, and alliances with firms outside the financial industry can be effective 
options. The Bank will continue to support these efforts by financial institutions. 
 IV. Economic Developments in Aomori Prefecture 
Now,  I  would  like  to  talk  about  the  economy  of  Aomori  Prefecture.  Looking  at  current 
developments,  economic  activity  in  Aomori  Prefecture  has  been  on  a  moderate  recovery 
                                                   
14  For discussions based on the comparison of financial institutions in Japan with those overseas, see 
Hiroshi  Nakaso,  "New  Frontier  of  Macroprudential  Policy:  Addressing  Financial  Institutions'  Low 
Profitability  and  Intensified  Competition,"  speech  at  the  Kin'yu  Konwa  Kai  (Financial  Discussion 
Meeting)  hosted  by  the  Jiji  Press,  November  29,  2017,  http://www.boj.or.jp/en/announcements 
/press/koen_2017/ko171129a.htm/.

trend,  albeit  at  a  slower  pace.  The  production  growth  has  decelerated,  reflecting  weaker 
overseas  demand.  Business  sentiment  of  primarily  manufacturing  firms  has  become 
cautious,  and  thus  business  fixed  investment  has  been more  or  less  flat.  Meanwhile,  labor 
market  conditions  have  continued  to  tighten,  and  private  consumption  has  maintained  its 
recovery trend with employee income improving. 
 Let me touch on the economic structure of the prefecture. The prefecture has experienced a 
continued decline in population for 20 years longer than Japan overall and faced shrinking 
internal  demand.  During  this  time,  it  has  taken  initiatives  such  as  inviting  firms  and 
managed  to  maintain  its  economic  scale  by  attracting  demand  from  other  prefectures  -- 
mainly the Tokyo metropolitan area -- and from overseas. It does not seem easy, however, to 
keep  its  economic  scale  going  forward  as  the  population  already  has  started  to  decrease 
across the country. That being said, I also have felt during this visit that the prefecture has 
many advantages in terms of overcoming the challenges. Also, it is not constructive to only 
focus  on  the  negative  side  of  the  declining  population.  Declining  birthrates  and  aging 
populations  are  now  advancing  worldwide.  As  I  mentioned  earlier,  Japan's  economy  has 
continued  to  improve  moderately  since  2013  despite  a  prolonged  declining  trend  in 
population.  Even 
though 
the  population  continues 
to  decrease,  we  can  prepare 
countermeasures  if  we  factor  that  in  beforehand.  As  aging  population  has  progressed,  the 
healthy  life  expectancy  has  become  longer.  As  evidenced  by  the  fact  that  drones  and 
artificial intelligence (AI) already have started to be used in agriculture here, the declining 
population can promote innovation.15 
 For  example,  Aomori  Prefecture  has  abundant  resources,  such  as  one  of  the  largest 
agriculture,  forestry,  and  fishery  industries  in  Japan,  manufacturing  firms  of  worldwide 
prominence, as well as a natural environment and culture that attract attention from all over 
                                                   
15  At the G20 Symposium co-hosted by the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance on January 
17, 2019, the theme of the  discussion was "demographic changes and macroeconomic challenges." 
In the session, Toshitaka Sekine, Director General of the Research and Statistics Department at the 
Bank of Japan, discussed the extension of healthy life expectancy accompanied by that of longevity, 
and  Yasuyuki  Sawada,  Chief  Economist  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  discussed  the 
possibility  of  the  declining  population  promoting  innovation.  For  more  information,  see 
https://www.g20fukuoka2019.mof.go.jp/en/meetings/20190117.html.

the world. As a big fan of Jomon culture, I feel very encouraged to hear about the efforts to 
register  Jomon  Archaeological  Sites  on  the  World  Cultural  Heritage  List.  I  met  people 
working  on  vitalizing  the  local  economy  by  making  the  most  of  these  advantages.  In 
addition,  Aomori  Prefecture  has  diverse  cultures,  history,  and  economic  structures, 
depending  on  the  area.  To  make  use  of  such  diversity,  I  hope  that  not  only  existing  firms 
will make active efforts, but also startups aiming at achieving new growth will be provided 
with  coordinated  support  by  the  industries,  the  administration,  academics  and  research 
institutions,  as  well  as  financial  institutions.  Such  initiatives  are  expected  to  help  the 
prefecture make further progress toward its goal of realizing a self-sustaining economy. As 
the  central  bank  of  Japan,  we  also  will  support  the  local  economy  by,  for  example, 
analyzing the situation and disseminating information through the Aomori Branch. I would 
like  to  ask  for  your  continued  cooperation  regarding  the  activities  of  the  branch  going 
forward. 
 Conclusion 
Mitsuru Yoshida, known as the author of Senkan Yamato no saigo (Requiem for Battleship 
Yamato), once worked as General Manager of the Bank's Aomori Branch from 1965 through 
1968.  Yoshida,  who  was  very  fond  of  Aomori  Prefecture,  placed  high  expectations  on  its 
potential, saying that Aomori could be the Norway of Japan, and that Aomori was a "future 
prefecture."16  He  also  stated  that,  if  all  the  potential  could  be  exploited,  there  would  be  a 
bright  future  ahead,  and  that  we  could  not  just  keep  waiting  to  firmly  grasp  those  big 
dreams in our hands. These words apply not only to Aomori Prefecture but also to Japan's 
economy as a whole. 
 As I already mentioned, most of the Heisei era was one of deflation, and marked by a battle 
against  it.  Unfortunately,  Japan's  economy  stagnated  in  that  deflationary  era.  While  other 
advanced economies achieved inflation of around 2 percent, we have to take seriously the 
fact that only Japan fell into deflation for a long period. As price stability is stipulated as the 
principle  of  the policy  conduct in the  Bank of  Japan  Act, the  Bank  has a  responsibility  to 
                                                   
16  Yoshida's essays on Aomori Prefecture were first compiled in Aomori sanka (Aomori: To-o Nippo 
Press  Co.,  Ltd.,  1967),  and  are  now  included  in  Yoshida  Mitsuru  Chosakushū,  vol.  2  (Tokyo: 
Bungeishunju Ltd., 1986).

avoid  deflation.17  The  Bank  will  firmly  pursue  policy  conduct  so  that  the  economy  will 
never fall into deflation in the new Reiwa era. 
 Thank you very much for your attention. 
                                                    
17  "The  responsibility  for  deflation  basically  lies  in  monetary  policy.  This  is  because  central  banks 
are obliged to avoid deflation or inflation and stabilize prices." See Haruhiko Kuroda, Zaisei kin'yū 
seisaku no seikō to shippai (Tokyo: Nippon Hyōron sha Co., Ltd., 2005), p.182.
