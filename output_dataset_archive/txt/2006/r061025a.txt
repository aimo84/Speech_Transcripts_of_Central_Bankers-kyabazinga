Jean-Pierre Roth: Prospects and limitations of Switzerland as a business 
location 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Swiss 
National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the 
Annual General Meeting of the Swiss Marketing Association, Zurich, 24 October 2006. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bankâ€™s website (www.snb.ch). 
 In  the  economy  and  in  politics,  there  is  optimism  in  the  air  again.  In  addition  to  the  favourable 
economic  conditions,  the  performance  of  Swiss  companies  on  the  global  markets  has  also  been  a 
driving  force.  Working  from  their  Swiss  business  base,  companies  have  taken  advantage  of  the 
opportunities afforded by globalisation and are expanding all over the world. Ensuring price stability is 
the most important contribution a central bank can make to a business location and thus to the growth 
potential  of  a  country.  Significant  progress  has  been  made  globally  in  this  area  in  recent  years.  A 
number of factors suggest that increased competition has had an impact on this development in that it 
has  changed  the  political  environment  for  central  banks.  Competition  has  become  stiffer  in  recent 
years, also in Switzerland. Not only market forces, but also economic policy reforms have played a 
role. There continues to be a need for action here, however. If we can succeed in implementing the 
reforms that are still outstanding, there is a chance that economic growth can be propelled to a level 
beyond the current economic upswing.
