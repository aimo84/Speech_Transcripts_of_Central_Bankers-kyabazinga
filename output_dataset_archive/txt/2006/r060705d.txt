Krzysztof Rybiński: Globalization versus financial markets 
Address  by Mr  Krzysztof Rybiński, Deputy  President  of  the  National  Bank  of  Poland,  at  the “Index” 
Students’ Association for Capital Markets and the Department of Capital Markets series of seminars, 
Cracow University of Economics, Cracow, 20 April 2006. 
 Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Whilst preparing for today’s address, I entered “globalne, Kraków” into the Google search engine. The 
following websites, among others, have been found: the website of the Regional Examination Board 
that provides information on lower secondary school graduation exams, the TVP3 regional service that 
informs of an increase in the number of Ryanair flights from Cracow, Wrocław and Poznań, and the 
website of the most beautiful cities of Europe, where Cracow is duly mentioned next to Florence and 
London. The Google search has found 97,400 websites containing the sought phrase in 0.49 seconds. 
A  similar  attempt  for  other  cities  has  resulted  in  the  following:  Poznań  75,000,  Gdańsk  68,900, 
Białystok 20,500, Warszawa 163,000 and Wrocław 306,000. A search for “global London” results in 
236  million  websites,  “global  Berlin”  –  67.6  million,  “global  Bangalore”  –  12  million  websites,  and 
“global Krakow / Kraków / Cracow” – 3.6 million websites. 
Obviously, the results are incomparable – for numerous reasons. The English language is much more 
popular than Polish – it is the online lingua franca and at the same time spoken in India and the UK. 
Moreover,  whilst  searching  for  “globalne,  Kraków”  one  would  have  to  enter  the  words  in  various 
declinations. Nonetheless, this exercise shows that Cracow and the entire Poland have fast become a 
part  of  the  global  economy.  Dissemination  of  information  and  telecommunication  technologies  is 
bound  to  drive  the  acceleration  of  the  globalization  process,  which  will  in  turn  enhance  labour 
productivity. At the same time, a search for “derivatives” gives 55 million websites, “global markets” – 
287 million, “currencies” – 97 million and “stocks” – 244 million. This shows that financial markets are 
global. Let us consider the reasons behind and the effects of globalization of financial markets. 
Globalization on financial markets 
Globalization  of  financial  markets  is  part  of  a  wider  phenomenon  of  globalization  of  national 
economies.  The  rapid  growth  of  the  international  trade  in  goods  and  services,  which  has  been  in 
progress since the beginning of the 1960s, has entailed an increase in capital flows. Between 1970 
and 2000 the value of world exports of goods and services increased twenty-five fold, accompanied by 
a fifty-fold increase in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) (Chart 1 and Chart 2). Many countries, having 
realized  that  the  FDI  is  an  important  factor  that  accelerates  the  economic  growth,  have  introduced 
changes to their legal regulations, aimed to attract foreign capital (Table 1). The globalization process 
on the financial markets started following the decline of the Bretton Woods system. Globalization of 
the  financial  markets  exhibited  a  pronounced  acceleration  in  the  1980s  and  1990s.  Since  1973, 
international trade has been growing on average by 11% per annum (from 22% of the GDP in 1973 to 
over 40% of the GDP in 2002), whereas the capital flows1 increased from 7% of the global GDP in 
1973 up to over 20% of the GDP in 2002. 
                                                      
1  Capital flows are defined here as a total of the FDI, portfolio investments and other investments recognized in the financial 
account of the balance of payments statement, exclusive of changes in receivables and liabilities of monetary authorities 
and the central government.

Along with an increase in the value of international trade, enterprises have become active participants 
of  the  FX market.  Between  1989 and 2004  the  turnover  in  the global  spot  FX  market  increased  by 
nearly 100% (Chart 3).

An  increase  in  international  capital  flows  and  the  development  of  information  and  communication 
technologies  have  triggered  portfolio  investments  on  international  markets.  On  the  other  hand, 
enterprises and banks have increasingly frequently raised capital abroad. For instance, between 1989 
and  2000,  the  value  of  cross-border  investments  in  shares  increased  over  twelve-fold,  whereas 
between  1994  and  2005,  the  value  of  debt  securities  issued  on  foreign  markets  increased  six-fold 
(Chart  4  and  Chart  5).  Non-bank  financing  of enterprises  has  also  gained  in  significance.  In  1980, 
enterprises  raised  USD  4.5  trillion  on  the  capital  market,  whereas  in  2004,  the  figure  stood  at  over 
USD 60 trillion (Chart 6).

As  opposed  to  green-field  investments,  the  portfolio  capital  is  very  mobile  and,  depending  on  the 
situation (macroeconomic or political) it may move easily among local markets. This may lead to high 
instability  on  the  FX  market  causing  significant  exchange  rates  fluctuations.  One  of  the  methods  of 
hedging against the risk of currency appreciation or depreciation is taking positions in derivatives. A 
dynamic growth of the derivatives market is the result of an increase in the cross-border flows in the 
financial markets. Between 1995 and 2004, the turnover on the global derivatives market grew nearly 
two-fold, whereas during the same period the activity on all exchange-traded derivatives grew almost 
three-fold (Chart 7).

 Reasons for globalization of financial markets  
The key factors that brought about the aforementioned changes in capital flows and in the structure of 
the global financial market comprise the following:  
• 
liberalization  of  national  financial  markets  and  the  related  growing  competition  among 
financial institutions, 
technological progress in IT and telecommunications,  
faster flow of information and its standardisation, 
globalization  of  national  economies  in  their  various  aspects  (commerce,  institutions, 
ownership structure, capital and knowledge). 
 The  liberalization  of  national  financial  markets  has  eliminated  restrictions  in  the  operations  of  both 
domestic and foreign financial entities. Regulations regarding the range of services performed by the 
banks and other financial institutions have been changed. Legal framework has been established to 
facilitate  the  activities  of  non-banking  financial  institutions.  Last  but  not  least,  restrictions  on  non-
residents’ access to domestic financial markets have been reduced or removed. However, the factor of 
the  greatest  significance  from  the  point  of view  of  globalization  of  financial  markets  was  the 
liberalization  of  capital  flows.  First  and foremost,  it  consisted  in  the  removal  of  restrictions  that 
impaired free capital flow among countries, including in particular:2
• 
• 
removal of restrictions related to FDI and trade in goods and services with non-residents, 
transition  of  the  developed  countries  to  the  floating  exchange  rate  regimes,  establishing 
of the euro area, and other supranational integration initiatives, 
reduction of tax on cross-border transactions (Chart 8). 
• 
In some countries, liberalization of capital flows and financial markets ensued from the implementation 
of stability programmes recommended by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. As a 
consequence, a group of countries named emerging markets have appeared on the world economic 
map. These countries play a vital role both in the global financial system and in the global economy.

The  technological  progress  in  IT  and  telecommunications,  in  particular  the dynamic  growth  of  the 
Internet  and  database  systems,  has  significantly  impacted  the globalization  of  financial  markets. 
Technological changes would not have been possible without a huge reduction in the cost of computer 
memory and data transmission. At present, the cost of manufacturing of a microprocessor is nearly 
1,000 times lower than it was 30 years ago, and the cost of data transmission (1 byte over a distance 
of 1 km) is over a hundred-fold lower. Modern technologies have enhanced the capacity of creating 
and  marketing  new,  less  expensive  goods  and  services.  The  increased  computing  power  has 
facilitated valuation of complex financial instruments, such as options, swaps and convertible bonds, 
which has contributed to a rapid development of derivatives market.  
The development of IT and telecommunications has streamlined prompt acquisition and processing of 
information necessary for operations on the financial market. Information used on the financial market 
has become as much of a commodity as any other (e.g. washing powder). It is produced according to 
specific standards and is comparable (the format of data on inflation, balance of payments or quarterly 
performance of a listed company are presented in a similar manner, irrespective of the country that 
publishes the data).  
Today,  we  all  take  it  for  granted.  Whereas  only  in  1997,  when  I  became  the  chief  economist 
responsible  for  the  analysis  of  the  Polish  economy  with  a  large  international  financial  institution, 
releases of the macroeconomic data were not scheduled. Data on inflation or output simply appeared 
in information services at certain times. The NBP used to send the data on the balance of payments 
by  fax  to  those  analysts  who  requested  for  them.  When, as  the  first  financial  markets  economist  in 
Poland, I launched a weekly macroeconomic service for customers, an analysis, which was one or two 
pages long, would be put on the pre-programmed fax machine, and it was not until the afternoon that 
the transmission was accomplished. At present, nearly every bank in Poland has its chief economist 
supported by a team of analysts who send hundreds or thousands of e-mails every morning, which 
reach tens of thousands of investors worldwide (banks, investment funds, arbitrage funds, company 
managements, wealthy private banking customers, decision-makers and central bankers). At present, 
the management of a large fund may receive hundreds of e-mails daily that contain analyses of listed 
companies, currencies, or macroeconomic and political developments. Nowadays, the problem does 
no  longer  involve  access  to  information,  but  pertains  to  the  excessive  amounts  of  information  and 
analyses that must be skilfully selected.  
In response to these – and other – challenges3 international standards have been elaborated in the 
recent years. Not only the quantity, but also the quality of information and the comparability of data 
have been increasingly appreciated. In addition, unification of principles that govern the functioning of 
individual financial market areas has been a precondition for the development of effective competition 
in  the  international  financial  system.  Uniform  and  commonly  applicable  standards  lower  the  cost  of 
acquisition and analysis of information and reinforce the financial system stability. The most significant 
standards include, inter alia, the following:  
• 
the principles of effective banking supervision, drawn up by the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision (BCBS), 
international  accounting  standards,  over  100  countries  have  adopted  or based  their  own 
accounting  standards  on  the  International  Accounting  Standards  (IAS)  or  the  International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), 
master agreements on executing transactions on the interbank market ― ISDA, ISMA, 
statistical methodologies elaborated by, inter alia, the IMF, the BIS, and the WB that ensure 
compliance  of  the  data  gathered  with  the  statistical  guidelines  and  their  international 
comparability, 
the principles of best practice, elaborated by professional associations of financiers. 
• 
The development of the modern financial market infrastructure has also covered regulatory changes 
(e.g. the bankruptcy law) and the establishment of modern transactional systems, payment systems, 
settlement  systems,  risk  management  systems,  and  information  services  –  such  as  Reuters  or 
Bloomberg.  Stock  exchanges  and  brokers  have  created  modern  trading  platforms  which  enable

prompt  offer-matching,  executing  transactions  and  straight  through  processing.  Development  of  the 
infrastructure has removed barriers to further market globalization. For instance, a factor that impeded 
the FX market development in the 1990s was the settlement risk. In response to that, the banks that 
were the most active on the FX market created CLS – a new settlement system that operates based 
on the payment versus payment principle.4 The new, supranational system has significantly reduced 
the credit risk and liquidity risk of FX operations, and thus increased banks’ activity on the FX market. 
At present, 15 currencies are settled in the CLS Bank. The system has also lowered costs incurred by 
the  banks,  as  it  helped  decrease  the  number  of  payment  instructions  and  the  value  of  funds 
transferred in local payment systems.5
In view of the fast progressing globalization of financial markets, it seems reasonable to raise 
the  question whether  the world  has  benefited  from  the  globalization  of  financial  markets,  or 
whether it has become more risky. 
The  effects  of  globalization  of  financial  markets  are  diverse.  The  openness  of economies  and  free 
capital flows induce investors to deposit their funds where they can generate the highest rate of return, 
which prompts financial institutions to execute transactions on new, poorly developed and non-liquid 
markets. It favours the increase in the liquidity of financial markets6 and the decrease in the cost of 
transactions.  
Globalization  has  a  significant  impact  on  the  lower  cost  of  capital  acquisition  by  enterprises.  They 
increasingly  often  use  forms  of  raising  capital  alternative  to  the  bank  loan,  especially  the  issue  of 
securities  on  the  financial  markets.  The  reasons  behind  this  phenomenon  are  the  decreasing 
expectations of investors as to the expected rate of return that compensates the assumed risk. At the 
same time, better transparency of enterprises (monitoring of the senior management, supervision over 
shareholders,  and  making  them  subject  to  the  market  discipline)  entails  a  decrease  in  the  agency 
costs  that  result  from  the  mismatch  of  investment  objectives  between  the  management  and  the 
shareholders.  As a consequence,  enterprises  can  more  easily  raise  funds  for  financing  their 
initiatives.7  Large  companies  are  more  inclined  to  promote  regulations  and  laws  that  improve  the 
transparency  of  financial  markets  and  reduce  the  asymmetry  of  information  among  market 
participants. In addition, institutional reforms that improve the market transparency and the quality of 
communicated information are implemented, under the influence of investors. The deregulation that is 
taking  place  removes  artificial  market  entry  barriers  and  facilitates  their  smooth  operation.  Thus, 
globalization  stimulates  the  financial  market  development,  which  in  turn  gives  enterprises  easier 
access to capital. Higher availability of funds may impact investments and in this way stimulate the 
economic growth.8
Introduction  of  the  euro  has  eliminated  the  FX  risk  and  contributed  to  abolition  of investment  limits 
related to the items of securities portfolio denominated in foreign currency. This has lowered the cost 
of raising capital from 0.5 to 3 percentage points. At the same time, the convergence of those costs 
took place among the EU-15 within the same economy sectors.9
The  global  financial  market  enables  business  entities,  including  banks,  to  raise  funds  for  business 
development from a larger number of investors than it would have been possible on domestic markets. 
For instance, in many smaller EU countries, a significant number of bank transactions is carried out 
with foreign partners.10
Access to the international capital market for banks and other financial institutions translates not only 
to the possibility of development, but also to the pressure on improvement of efficiency. The growing

efficiency and better risk management improves the security of deposits placed with banks. Foreign 
competition  is  also  an  important  catalyst  for  dissemination  of  financial  innovations.11  Moreover, 
domestic banks that compete with foreign banks exhibit more interest in introducing new accounting 
standards and financial reporting requirements, so that better quality of information on the companies 
financed  allows  them  to  extend  more  profitable  loans.  Domestic  financial  institutions  are  becoming 
more  efficient,  due  the  new  technologies  and  best  practice  provided  to  the  market  by  foreign 
companies. 
Integration of financial markets worldwide enables better risk diversification. Residents do not have to 
invest their savings in their own country and thus they are not exposed to the business cycle risk. They 
are free to invest in many countries and could obtain a better ratio of expected return to assumed risk.  
Globalization of financial markets also entails new challenges and threats. The lack of transparency, 
resulting  from  asymmetry,  raises  the  risk  of  speculative  bubbles  and  herd  behaviour  of  investors. 
Uneven access to information in the global markets environment may lead to a negative selection in 
the financing of the enterprise sector and the moral hazard in a situation where the bankruptcy of a 
given institution would jeopardize the banking sector.12
Economic  reforms  and  opening  the  country  to  international  trade  in  the  emerging  markets  attract 
foreign capital, which, however, in the case of deteriorating economic situation, is withdrawn quickly. 
This invokes FX crises, which, as a result of an increase in interest rates, may turn into bank crises.13 
Additionally,  international  links  of  institutions  and  the  speed  of  transmission  of  information  among 
markets streamline the spreading of such crises over other economies. International financial crises 
that started in Thailand in 1997, in Russia in 1998 and in Brazil in 1999 and subsequently spread over 
to other countries in the region and even as far as to other continents, may serve as an example.  
Frederic  Mishkin  gives  other  examples  of  threats  posed  by  globalization.14  Financial  liberalisation 
reduces the number of instruments which discipline the banking activities. This has led to credit booms 
in many countries, often financed by foreign entities and in foreign currencies. Credit booms have thus 
become  a  frequent  source  of  banking  crises.15  Banking  crises,  on  the  other  hand,  have  generated 
significant costs for the economy, inter alia, through the necessity of liquidity injections to some banks 
or through limiting the supply of loans to companies. 
Increased share of foreign capital in local financial markets raises their sensitivity to the developments 
on  foreign  markets.  For  instance,  an  increase  in  interest  rates  in  another  country  may  cause  an 
outflow of short-term capital, and in consequence lead to an increase in interests rates and a decrease 
in  liquidity  on  a  local  market.  Banks  operating  on  the  global  financial  market  are  subject  to  higher 
competition, also due to the fact that investors compare the banks’ performance results on an ongoing 
basis.  As  noticed  by  Raghuram  Rajan, banks  nowadays  focus  more  than  ever  on  maintaining  their 
income on a high level, at the cost of assuming higher risk.16 Financial instruments traded by banks 
are becoming increasingly complex and thus less liquid and carrying higher risk.  
The effect of globalization is the establishment of international financial conglomerates. In the case of 
an  economic  crisis,  the  conglomerates  may  channel  it  through  to  other  markets.  Such  companies 
could be very important for the stability of the financial system in a country or region. Their bankruptcy 
may evoke a crisis, even in a steadily growing economy and even in the situation when the financial 
problems have stemmed from a foreign market. The lack of standard procedure for solving problems 
of  international  financial  institutions  impairs  prevention  and  solving  of  financial  crises.  The  existing 
safety net established by national economic authorities is frequently a source of moral hazard for large

financial institutions,17 which apply less restrictive policy of financing business entities, expecting that 
when problems arise, the taxpayers of a given country will pay part of the bill. 
Last but not least, an unfavourable effect of globalization is the centralisation of risk management and 
sometimes even of liquidity management at the bank group level. The process results in transferring 
operations from small, local markets to more developed ones. This phenomenon has been observed 
e.g. in Poland. Owners of foreign banks operating in Poland more and more often decide to transfer 
their activity on the zloty market and the FX options market to London (Chart 9). It reduces the liquidity 
of the domestic market, and the zloty exchange rate becomes ever-more dependent upon investment 
decisions of non-residents.18

 Does globalization really take place: well-known economic puzzles 
The  data  and  mechanisms  presented  above  illustrate  the  fast  progressing  globalization  of  financial 
markets. Nevertheless, numerous studies have shown phenomena that should not occur in a situation 
of  growing  commercial  and  financial  links.  For  instance,  if  there  existed  a  global  financial  market, 
capital  should  flow  from  the  developed  countries  to  the  developing  ones.  This  is,  however,  not  the 
case,  as  noted  by  Robert  Lucas19,  and the  “Lucas  puzzle”  named  after  the  author was  formulated. 
There have been numerous works that attempted to resolve this puzzle. One of the most recent works, 
which presents a panel analysis of nearly a hundred countries in the period 1970-2000, has shown 
that the prevailing reason for the lack of capital flow from wealthy to poor countries are institutional 
factors.20  or instance,  improving  the  quality  of  operation  of  institutions  in  Peru  to  catch  up  with 
Australia would mean a four-fold increase in foreign investment, and improving the quality of operation 
of institutions in Turkey to catch up with the UK would increase foreign investment by 60%.  
Another puzzle, which over some time made challenging the fact that globalization of financial markets 
was actually taking place possible, was the “Feldstein-Horioka puzzle.”21 Both authors in their famous

work of 1980 estimated the correlation between the national savings rate and the investment rate in 
the  years  1960-1974  at  0.89.  This  correlation  for  the  years  1990-1997  was  estimated  at  0.60,  and 
having included South Korea – at 0.76. Despite a pronounced fall, the correlation between the national 
savings and investment remained high.22 his constituted a peculiar puzzle, as in the global world of 
finance there were no good reasons for which investments were to be financed with residents’ savings 
rather  than  with  loans  drawn  on  the  global  financial  market.  As  in  the  case  of  the  “Lucas  puzzle”, 
numerous works have been  written  to  explain  this  phenomenon.  In  the most  recent  work by  Martin 
Feldstein  regarding  this  subject,23  the  newly  estimated  correlation  rate  gradually  decreased  over 
subsequent  decades  to  reach  a  mere  0.19  in  the  decade  ending  in  2002.  The  decreases  regard 
mostly smaller countries, but the estimates for large countries also show that the correlation rate fell 
from 0.92 down to 0.59. Therefore, it seems that over 10 recent years the process of globalization of 
financial markets exhibited a pronounced deepening. 
One  may  wonder  why  the  recent  years  have  witnessed  acceleration  and  deepening  of the 
globalization process, given that some phenomena that are universally deemed the reasons behind 
globalization, started a few decades ago. It seems that apart from the – growing for a few years now – 
role  of  the  global  financial  markets  and  the  liberalization  of commerce,  new  factors  have  emerged, 
such as taking advantage of the technological progress in the ICT and joining the global economy by 
China  and  India.  Thomas  Friedman,  author  of  the  famous  book  entitled  “The  World  Is  Flat:  A  Brief 
History  of  the  Twenty-First  Century”,24  hows  how  radical  the  changes  in  the  organization  of  the 
manufacturing process and service performance have been over the recent years, as a result of, inter 
alia,  the  use  of  new  communication  technologies,  such  as  the  Internet,  mobile  phones,  or  the 
appearance of such techniques of gaining and processing information as the Google search engine. I 
may share my personal thought with you. I have just completed my work on the first draft of a paper 
discussing global imbalances. Owing to the Internet and new websites providing specialist information 
and knowledge in the area of economy, it took me three months to write the article. I worked on it only 
in my free time, of which I do not have much as the deputy president of the central bank. Ten years 
ago,  over  a  three–month  period,  I  would  probably  not  have  been  able  to  collect  even  half  of  the 
literature, not to mention the ongoing monitoring of speeches delivered at all important conferences 
dedicated to global imbalances. It goes without saying that progress in the ICT has contributed to the 
deepening of the globalization process and significantly enhanced labour productivity in many sectors.  
Global imbalances 
One  of  the  manifestations  of  globalization  in  recent  years  are  global  imbalances.  In 2005,  the  US 
current account deficit approached 6.5% of the GDP, and many forecasts of investment banks point to 
its  further  increase  in  2006  and  2007.25 The  negative  net  investment  position of  the world’s  largest 
economy has moved towards 30% of the GDP in 2005 and, according to all available forecasts, it is 
bound to deteriorate at a high rate. 
The  large  current  account  deficit  in  the  US  is  related  to  the  negative  savings  of households  and  a 
strong growth in real property prices. These phenomena have occurred in the recent years not only in 
the  US  but  also  in  all  Anglo-Saxon  countries.26  Moreover,  the current  account  deficit  in  the  US  is 
financed in a great measure by purchases of American debt securities by the Asian central banks. It 
entails a significant increase in the exchange reserves of the said banks. For instance, the reserves of 
the People’s Bank of China went up from USD 166 billion in December 2000 to USD 819 billion in 
December 2005 and over USD 850 billion in March 2006. It means that China is now ahead of Japan

deficit will amount to USD 759 billion in 2005 and will increase to USD 805 billion in 2006. Both values correspond to 6.1% 
of  the  forecasted  GDP.  Some  forecasts  by  investments  banks,  however,  indicate  an  increase  in  the  forecasted  current 
account deficit to 6.5% of the GDP in 2005 and to 7-8% of the GDP in 2006 and 2007.

The situation where the world’s largest economy and at the same time the issuer of the global reserve 
currency  has  such  a  large  savings  deficit  financed  in  such  an  unusual  way  has  triggered  a  hot 
economic debate on the two following issues. Firstly, attempts are being made to explain how global 
imbalances  have  come  into  being.  Secondly,  both  academic  economists  and  strategists  with 
investment  banks  are  trying  to  assess  the  possible  scenarios  of  further  developments.  Are  global 
imbalances a regular phenomenon in the global economy and can they increase further without any 
harm  to  the  outlook  for  the  long-term  global  growth?  Can a radical  adjustment  of  these  imbalances 
occur – and if yes, what will be the mechanism of such an adjustment and what will its consequences 
for the global growth be? 
Let  us  begin  with  the  presentation  of  the  main  hypotheses  that  explain  the phenomenon  of  global 
imbalances. In 2003, three economists presented a hypothesis that an informal Bretton Woods regime 
had been reactivated.28 The original Bretton Woods system was established after WWII and consisted 
in  a  formal  commitment  of  its  participant  countries  to  maintain  foreign  exchange  rates,  determined 
against  a  gold  parity,  at  a  specific  level,  with  acceptable  deviations  not  exceeding  1  percent.  The 
system  ceased  to  exist  in  1971,  after  president  Nixon  had  taken  a  decision  that  the  US  would  no 
longer  exchange  dollars  for  gold  according  to  the  parity  determined.  The  nature  of  the  reactivated 
Bretton Woods, often called Bretton Woods 2, is well conveyed in the motto used by the authors of this 
concept: 
“(…) if I had an agreement with my tailor that whatever money I pay him returns to me on the 
very same day as a loan, I would have no objection at all to ordering more suits from him” 
(Jacques Rueff, 1965, after Dooley et al. (2003).  
                                                      
27   Taking  into  account  the  fact  that  China  has  already  used  USD  60  billion  of  its  foreign  exchange  reserves  for  capital 
injections to two commercial banks, the People’s Bank of China has a level of reserves that exceeds USD 900 billion. 
28   A series of articles on the topic was commenced with the work of M.Dooley, D.Folkerts-Landau and P.Garber „An Essay on 
the Revived Bretton Woods System“, NBER Working Paper 9971, September 2003.

 BIS Review 60/2006
The  hypothesis  of  the  existence  of  an  informal  Breton  Woods  2  says  that  a  system  has  been 
established in which it is profitable for the Asian countries to finance the US current account deficit, 
because  it  enables  them  to  increase  their  exports  to  this  market.  Thus, it supports  the  economic 
growth of the Asian countries and makes it possible for them to create new jobs, which is particularly 
important in China, where – according to various estimates – each year between 10 and 20 million of 
jobs must be created, due to migration of the population from rural areas to cities. In order to maintain 
the competitiveness of their exports, the Asian countries intervene on the FX market, thus preventing 
appreciation of their currencies. The purchased US dollars are invested in American bonds, and thus 
the American current account deficit is financed. 
Another  hypothesis  that  explains  the  mechanism  of  occurrence  of  global  imbalances  has  been 
formulated  by  the  current  Chairman  of  the  Federal  Reserve,  Ben  Bernanke.29  His major  concept  is 
that the large US current account deficit cannot be explained solely by internal factors. In the opinion 
of Bernanke, external factors, which he has defined as the global savings glut, have played a key role. 
The hypothesis says that a significant surplus of savings over investments in the Asian countries, in 
combination with the structurally high savings in Germany and Japan, have caused the global savings 
glut. The savings glut has in turn had a contribution into the increase in prices on the stock exchanges 
in  the  US,  and subsequently  to  the  increase  of  property  prices, which  has  in  turn  lowered  the  level 
of savings of American households. 
The International Monetary Fund argues against the hypotheses of Bretton Woods 2 and the global 
savings glut by  stating  that  the source  of  the  current  account surplus  is an exceedingly  low  level  of 
investments  in  Asia,  except  for  China.  Therefore, one  should  speak  of  a  global  investment  draught 
rather  than  anything  else,30  as  over  the  five  years  following  the Asian  crisis  in  1997-1998,  the 
investment level was by 7 percentage points lower than in the five-year period preceding that crisis. 
Considering the above, an appropriate recommendation for those countries is not limiting their savings 
rate, but rather improving their investment climate.  
There are numerous theories that attempt to explain the occurrence of global imbalances. According 
to  some  of  them,  the  major  reason  behind  global  imbalances  is  the  low  level  of  savings  in  the  US 
household and public sectors,31 i.e. the fact that Americans spend more than they earn, and that the 
budget deficit, from a substantial surplus in the year 2000, turned into a level estimated at 4.7% of the 
GDP in 2004. Other hypotheses suggest that the factor that induces global imbalances is the change 
in  the  economic  policy  of  the  Asian  countries  after  the  crisis  of  1997-1998,  when  the  decision  was 
taken  in  many  countries  to establish  huge  foreign  exchange  reserves  for  the  purpose  of  hedging 
against similar changes in the sentiment on financial markets in the future.32 Economists also state 
that the factor that invokes global imbalances is the higher investment attractiveness of the US region 
as compared to other regions, measured with, among others, higher potential economic growth rate.33 
here exists another hypothesis, according to which such a high current account deficit is optimal,34 in 
the face of the expected higher future growth rate of the American economy in comparison to that of 
other  developed  economies.  According  to  that  hypothesis,  Americans  increase  their  consumption 
financed from loans, anticipating high future earnings that will allow them to pay off the loans, which is 
perfectly correct. Finally, there are papers which try to prove that there is … no deficit. An article by 
                                                      
29   The hypothesis of the global savings glut was formed for the first time in the speech by Ben Bernanke at the meeting of 
Virginia economists’ association in March 2005. 
30   E.g.  in  speeches  by  Rodrigo  Rato,  head  of  the  IMF,  and  Raghuram  Rajan,  head  of  the  IMF  Research  Department  in 
January and February 2006.

Hausmann and Sturzenegger35 that argues the existence of the “dark matter” is an example of this 
approach. 
In spite of many attempts to prove that the US current account deficit is in fact lower than it is believed 
to be, and that it is even desirable, a vast majority of academic economists and many central bankers 
are seriously alarmed by the scale of global imbalances. Many papers have been written which show 
what  may  be  the  consequences  of  the  scenario  in  which  the  financial  markets  –  in  view  of  no 
adequate  measures  undertaken  by  economic  decision-makers  –  initiate  adjustment  processes  by 
themselves.36 If the financial markets come to the view that the investment risk premium for American 
debt  securities  has  increased,  the  outflow  of  capital  from  this  market  –  or  even  decreased  capital 
inflows  –  may  lead  to  a  fall  in  bond  prices,  i.e.  to  a  sharp  increase  in  long-term  interest  rates, 
a slowdown  on  the  housing  market,  depreciation  of  the  dollar  and,  as  a  result,  stagnation  or  even 
recession, which may be observed globally.  
In  order  to  mitigate  the  probability  of  such  a  scenario,  structural  reforms  should  be  implemented  in 
many  countries.  The  US  should  substantially  reduce  its  budget  deficit  and  –  via  a  reform  of  the 
pension  system  and  the  healthcare  system  –  increase  the  household  savings  rate.  In  the  EU  and 
Japan a series of structural reforms should be accelerated to raise the flexibility and competitiveness 
of the labour market and the market of goods and services. In the Asian countries, and first of all in 
China, the exchange rate regime needs to be made more flexible, which should be preceded by the 
reforms  that  would  strengthen  the  financial  system,  also  via  a  greater  openness  to  foreign  capital 
inflows.  
At present, it is difficult to assess the likelihood of the scenario involving a serious slowdown in the 
global growth; nevertheless, implementation of necessary reforms proceeds slowly.  
Should monetary policy take into account speculative bubbles? 
The  globalization  process  is  a  great  challenge  for  central  banks  and  financial  market  regulators. 
Following the increase in global workforce resources, relative to the capital resources, the workforce 
costs decreased and resulted in the fall of costs of manufacturing of many goods and services. Having 
deducted the cost of fuel, whose increase also results from the globalization process, inflation remains 
very  low  in many  countries,  whereas  a  surge  in the  global  labour  supply  mitigates  the possibility  of 
occurrence of the second-round effects i.e. wage increases in response to a rise in current inflation. 
On the other hand, the global surplus of savings over investments causes the capital to be deposited 
on various asset markets entailing an increase in assets prices. Increases in stock exchange indices, 
bond  prices  or  real  property  prices  in  the  Anglo-Saxon  countries  may  serve  as  examples  here. 
Naturally,  a question  arises  what  monetary  policy  should  be  conducted  in  such  conditions.  In 
particular, the question is whether it should respond to the increase in the asset prices, despite the fact 
that inflation of consumer goods and services is low or very low. A debate continues over that issue, 
where both arguments in favour of the necessity to respond to the bubbles on the asset markets,37 nd 
those against it, are raised.38  
The  issue  of  response of  monetary  policy  to  changes  in  assets  prices was  raised  by Donald  Kohn, 
member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, in his speech delivered in the previous 
month.39  According  to  Kohn,  two  approaches  are  possible.  In  one  of them,  described  as  the

 BIS Review 60/2006
conventional monetary policy, the central bank focuses on stabilising the inflation, treats changes in 
asset prices as an exogenous process, and does not attempt to influence asset prices whatsoever. 
The other option, described by Kohn as the “extra action” policy, provides for a deviation of current 
inflation  from  a  level  determined  as  stable,  in  return  for  an  improvement  of  the  perspectives  of 
achieving  price  stability  in  the  future.  However,  the  extra  action  policy  does  not  mean  bursting 
speculative bubbles by central banks. It rather means “buying” additional insurance against possible 
negative shocks, which may happen in the future. In Kohn’s opinion, the extra action policy may be run 
very rarely and only where the three conditions are met: 
• 
the central bank must be able to identify bubbles on the asset market in a timely manner and 
with high certainty as to the correctness of conclusions from the analysis, 
the  probability  that  a  slight  tightening  of  monetary  policy  will  be  able  to  stand  against  the 
speculative activity on a given asset market must be high, 
the  expected  improvement  of  the  future  economic  situation  resulting  from  a  smaller 
speculative bubble must be significant and higher than the costs incurred by the economy in 
the aftermath of running the additional action policy. 
  In view of the available studies, it may be stated that it is extremely difficult to sufficiently fulfil the three 
abovementioned conditions. It may not be excluded, however, that in the future, the understanding of 
economic processes will improve as much as to enable running the additional action policy in justified 
cases.  
In the discussion over the correct relation of economic policy to the bubbles building up on the asset 
market, there is a dominant conviction that the supervisory policy is a much better response. For this 
very reason, supervision over financial markets should be independent of politicians, as it may turn out 
necessary to take up actions aimed at limiting the rate of building up of the speculative bubble at a 
time when it is not convenient for politicians, considering the elections cycle. 
New challenges for regulators/supervisors 
Globalization of financial markets changes the operation conditions of financial institutions by opening 
new development opportunities for them, but also by creating new types of risk for the stability of the 
financial systems.  
Globalization creates new opportunities in the area of risk management, including but not limited to the 
most important banking risk, i.e. the credit risk. Development of new risk transfer instruments (credit 
derivatives and securitisation) and increase in the number of their purchasers enable more effective 
use of banks’ capital. New instruments, however, pose some threats.40 Both market participants and 
markets  supervisors  indicate  the issues  of  progressive  complexity  of  derivatives,  and  difficulties  in 
complete  understanding  and  estimating  the  risk  related  thereto.41  Difficulty  in  evaluating  risk  flow 
directions  and  lack  of  basic  data  on  some  unregulated  financial  institutions,  which  are  becoming 
increasingly active on the derivatives market, are also a problem. What I mean here are in particular 
the hedge funds, which manage increasing funds. 
New services offered by banks on the FX market, such as the prime brokerage, also create difficulties. 
Under a prime brokerage agreement, the bank makes its credit limits available to other institutions that 
speculate on the FX market, most frequently to hedge funds. As the product becomes widely used, 
supervisors  are  faced  with  a  growing  difficulty  in monitoring  the  credit  risk  and  liquidity  risk  of 
operations  concluded  on  the  FX  market,42  where  the  average  daily  net  turnover  amounts  to  USD 
1,900  trillion.  This  creates  quite  a  challenge  for  supervisors,  who  must  have  human  and  financial 
capital available to properly assess the risk in the increasingly global and complex world of finance. 
The understanding of the mechanics of financial markets is a never-ending challenge for supervisors.

The response  of  bank supervisors  gathered  in  the Basel Committee  on  Banking  Supervision  to  the 
increasing complexity of financial instruments in banks’ portfolios is the New Capital Accord (“Basel 
II”),  which  is  to  replace  the  regulations  currently  applicable  in over  100  countries.  The  new  capital 
regulation is an attempt of precise risk measurement, including but not limited to the credit risk, and its 
reflection in the capital requirements.  
Newly  emerging  institutions  operating  in  several  segments  and  on  several  markets  increase  the 
operational risk. It seems that the scale of threats related thereto grows in line with the technological 
development. Globalization of financial markets and relations among institutions of various segments 
trigger  a  disruption  that  may  bear  consequences  not  only  for  individual  institutions,  but  which  may, 
through the payment system, spread over to many other entities, including those in the real sector.43 
The operational risk problem has been noted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which 
for the very first time has included it in its supervisory regulations (the New Capital Accord). Banks and 
investment  funds  have  been  obligated  to  gather  information  on  operational  risk  incidents  and  to 
estimate capital to cover this risk. 
Capital mobility  and  business  activity  of  large,  international  financial  corporations also  translate  into 
institutional  changes  on  local  markets  and  challenges  to  be  faced  by  supervisory  authorities 
responsible for financial stability. Financial markets of the new EU Member States, whose large share 
is held by foreign investors, i.e. institutions operating globally or regionally, may serve as an example. 
In addition to the capital necessary for the development of the institutions and markets on which they 
operate, the presence of industry institutional investors has brought about a number of other positive 
results. These include better risk management, a modern range of products offered to customers, or 
the development of new distribution channels, to name just a few. 
Regional  integration  within  the  EU,  however,  means  that  the  application  of  a  uniform  bank  or 
insurance licence (i.e. taking up activity in any Member State under a licence obtained in the home 
country)  may  cause  certain  asymmetry  in  the  availability  of  data  and  a  conflict  of  interest  between 
supervisors  of  the  host  country  on  the  one  hand,  and  institution  owners  and  supervisors  from  the 
home  country  on  the  other.  Such  conflict  may  occur  as  a  result  of  transformation  of  foreign  bank 
subsidiaries, operating under local laws and fully supervised by the supervisory authorities of the host 
country, into branches supervised by foreign supervisory authorities. Individual foreign bank branches 
operating in the new EU Member States frequently constitute a vital element of the banking system, 
both in terms of the value of assets and deposits, operations on the domestic interbank market and the 
share in settlements in the payment system. Therefore, they are described as institutions of systemic 
importance  for  the  domestic  market.  At  the  same  time,  they  are  not  always  equally  important 
components of an international banking group, in terms of their size and the profit generated. In such a 
case, a relatively low importance of an institution may result in less focus on its supervision, both by 
the  foreign  bank  and  the  supervisory  authority  of  the  home  country  in  which  the  given  bank  has 
obtained its licence. 
As  I  have  mentioned  before,  supervisory  authorities  of  the  home  country  are responsible  for  direct 
supervision.  However,  supervisory  authorities  of  the  host  country  are  always  responsible  for  the 
financial  system  stability.  Responsibility  for  the  financial  stability  translates  not  only  to  preventive 
measures, but also to crisis management, including financial support to institutions or – in a broader 
sense – to markets that have lost their liquidity, but remain solvent. Appropriate authorities of the host 
country should thus have access to comprehensive information that enables a proper assessment of 
risk and financial standing of large financial institutions operating in its territory. The need to provide 
information has not been adequately articulated so far by international organisations that shape the 
supervisory architecture; however, the recent years have brought changes in this respect. The idea to 
transform the Nordea Bank, operating in the Baltic countries, into the so-called European company, 
and the subsequent transformation of its subsidiaries into branches, has supported the changes. For 
some  countries,  this  operation  means  a  loss  of supervisory  control  over  a  significant  part  of  the 
                                                      
43   An example of one of the first major incidents of operational nature were the problems of the Bank of New York. As a result 
of  a  computer  system  error  in  November  1985,  the  bank  was  unable  to  transfer  to  customers’  accounts  the  Treasury 
securities purchased for them, and enforce payments. In the meantime, the bank’s account was debited with payments for 
the securities. This caused a gigantic deficit on the current account held with the central bank and a necessity of emergency 
support from the FED. The financial consequences of a computer system error were incurred not only by the Bank of New 
York,  but  also  by  many  of  its  counterparties.  Illing  M.  “A  Review  of  Notable  Financial  Stress  Events”,  in:  “Essays  on

banking system, and dilemmas regarding the crisis support and the deposit guarantee system.44 The 
question whether the taxpayers of the host country, or solely those of the home country, should pay for 
possible bankruptcy of a bank, remains open. 
Conducting  operations  in  various  countries  and  segments  of  the  financial  market  (including  but  not 
limited to combination of the banking and insurance activities) leads to creation of complex structures 
of financial groups. This phenomenon has been included in the banking supervision organisation. At 
the EU level, this fact is reflected in the Directive on supplementary supervision of credit institutions, 
insurance  companies  and  investment  firms  in  a  financial  conglomerate,45  and  in  Poland  –  by  the 
Supplementary Supervision Act.46 The merit of the Act is a complex risk analysis within a single capital 
group  and  coordination  of  control  and  supervisory  activities  by  a  leading  supervisor,  with  the 
collaboration of authorities that supervise other entities in the financial conglomerate.47 The Act sets 
forth cooperation with foreign supervisors. 
Globalization  of  financial  markets  brings  about  new  challenges  for  central  banks  as  regards  crisis 
management. The terrorist attack of 11 September 2001 has revealed how far-reaching implications 
for  the  international  payment  system may  be  brought  about  by  switching  off  a  large-value  payment 
system  in  a  single  country.  In  the  circumstances  of the increasingly  integrated  financial  markets, 
central banks must also cooperate more closely and have their contingency plans in place to inject 
liquidity  to  the  global  financial system in a crisis situation.48  The  private  sector goes  even  further  to 
suggest that in a crisis situation central banks should extend intraday credit facility to all banks (not 
only  the  domestic  ones).  Intraday  credit  could  be  collateralized  by  foreign  currencies  or  securities 
denominated in foreign currencies – cross-border collateral pool facilities.49
Conclusions  
Ladies  and  Gentlemen,  globalization  of  financial  markets,  trade,  manufacturing,  services  and 
knowledge  is  a  great  opportunity  for  the  global  economy.  Owing  to  this  process,  the  developing 
countries may modernise and grow faster than they have ever done before. On the other hand, both 
manufacturers and consumers in the developed countries take advantage of the access to the huge 
global  labour  market,  which  makes  it  possible  to  lower  the  costs  of  manufacturing,  enhance 
productivity and – consequently – lower the prices of many goods and services. Both consumers and 
producers are also beneficiaries of globalization of the financial markets, which offer a wide range of 
products  and  enable  a better  adjustment  of  the  risk  profile  and  the  expected  return  or  cost  to  the 
preferences of investors and borrowers.  
Globalization also has its drawbacks. It generates new types of risk, which constitute challenges to 
central banks and supervisors of financial markets. Globalization of financial markets and the related 
rapid  growth  of  turnover  in  credit  derivatives,  such  as  CDOs  or  default  swaps,  force  a  focus  on 
understanding, what types of risk are generated in particular market segments. Such risks should be 
continuously analysed by central banks and supervisory authorities.  
It may happen in the future that the social groups which incur losses in the process of globalization will 
force the decision-makers to take up protectionist actions, which may contribute to significant lowering 
of  the  future  economic  growth,  through  limiting  the  benefits  from  international  trade.  Therefore, 
economic  policy,  especially  in  the  countries  with  a large  share  in  the  global  product,  should  be

conducted in a manner that would enable to avoid the scenario of protectionism growth. After all, one 
of  the  greater  threats  which  are  difficult  to  evaluate  is  the  risk  of  adjustment  of  global  imbalances, 
especially where it results from market forces without support from adequate reforms.  
So  far,  globalization  has  served  humanity  well.  I truly  hope  that  the  ever-greater  knowledge  of  risk 
types related to globalization will make it possible for us to conduct economic policy that will facilitate 
benefiting from globalization to the future generations the homo sapiens globalus.
