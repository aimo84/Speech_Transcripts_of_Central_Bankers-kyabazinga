Jean-Pierre Roth: Once a student, always a student 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Swiss 
National Bank, at the University of Bern, Switzerland, 9 February 2006.  
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bankâ€™s website (www.snb.ch). 
 Like  all  decisions  relating  to  the  future,  monetary  policy  decisions  involve  numerous  uncertainties. 
Economic researchers are divided as regards both the effects of monetary policy and the form that this 
policy  should  take.  There  are  a  number  of  competing  models  in  economic  theory,  and  their  policy 
recommendations often vary. Relationships that have been stable in the past may change at any time, 
due to the fact that the structural equations used in economic models are not based on the laws of 
nature. The Swiss National Bank's monetary policy concept takes account of these uncertainties. Our 
inflation forecast is a key element in this concept and combines the results obtained by a variety of 
different  models.  Research  is  extremely  important  in  our  changing  world.  We  can  only  be  sure  of 
identifying new developments as early as possible and basing our monetary policy decisions on a solid 
foundation if we engage in constant research.
