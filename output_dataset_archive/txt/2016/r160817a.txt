  Jorgovanka Tabaković: Overview of recent monetary and 
macroeconomic trends in Serbia 
Introductory speech by Dr Jorgovanka Tabaković, Governor of the National Bank of Serbia, 
at the presentation of the Inflation Report - August 2016, Belgrade, 17 August 2016. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, 
Welcome to the presentation of the August Inflation Report. As always, we will give you an 
overview  of monetary  and  macroeconomic  trends for  the  period  since the  previous  Report 
and set out our expectations for 2016 and 2017. 
However, before we move on to this, I would like to share with you a few thoughts about a 
much  longer  period,  because  recently  it  was  four  years  since  my  appointment  as  the 
Governor  of  the  National  Bank  of  Serbia.  Together  with  us  you  were  witnesses  to  the 
numerous challenges we faced, particularly from the international environment. Despite the 
challenges, the National Bank of Serbia has achieved admirable results – inflation is low and 
stable today as it has been for three years straight, which was not the case earlier. Our good 
results are not only due to global circumstances and low inflation abroad, because inflation in 
the international environment was around 2% rather long, while at the same time it was much 
higher  and  more  volatile  in  Serbia.  It  was  the  reduction  in  Serbia’s  internal  and  external 
imbalances  and  the  maintaining  of  relative  stability  of  the  exchange  rate  that  were 
instrumental to bringing inflation in Serbia to a level comparable to that of other countries. At 
the same time, deflation was averted. Expectations of market participants that inflation will 
remain low for the next two years represent another indicator of confidence in the National 
Bank of Serbia and the measures it implements.

In  conditions  of  relatively  high  euroisation  of  the  financial  system  which  has  grown  strong 
roots in Serbia and is inherited from the hyperinflation period, we all feel very strongly about 
the relative stability of the exchange rate. It is important to us because relative stability of the 
exchange  rate  means  lower  pressure  on  the  prices  of  imported  products  and  in  turn  on 
inflation  at  home.  Moreover,  it  has  shown  to  be  the  cornerstone  of  the  overall  financial 
stability  and  business  predictability.  I  believe  that  over  the  past  four  years  we  have 
demonstrated  not  only  the  desire  but  also  the  capacity  to  achieve  and  maintain  relative 
stability of the exchange rate, even in difficult times, when many other countries failed to do 
so. I use the word “capacity” because the value of the dinar was preserved owing to greater 
effectiveness of the National Bank of Serbia’s interventions in the foreign exchange market, 
whereas overall stability was attained through full coordination of monetary and fiscal policy

  measures. You can judge for yourselves whether it truly is so based on the fact that over the 
past four years the dinar depreciated by less than 3.5%.

  Having reduced the key policy rate from 11.75%, where it was in May 2013, to the current 
4.0%, which is its lowest since the introduction of the inflation targeting regime, the National 
Bank of Serbia, beyond any doubt, has provided critical support to the country’s economic 
recovery. As a result, interest rates on dinar loans to corporates and households dropped by 
more than 10 percentage points. We find it encouraging that the number of your questions 
about dinarisation is increasing because this means that you too recognise that dinarisation 
is gradually and unquestionably growing in the household sector. Dinar savings have risen 
almost threefold since end-2012, which we interpret as growth of confidence in the domestic 
currency,  as  well  as  in  the  activities  of  the  NBS.  When  compared  to  savings  in  foreign 
currencies, savings in dinars do not measure up, but they are constantly increasing. In the 
first half of the year, 75% of new loans to households were denominated in dinars. We are 
pleased  to  see  that  the  results  achieved  by  the  National  Bank  of  Serbia  –  such  as  low 
inflation, relative stability of the exchange rate and halved interest rates in the dinar market – 
are  encouraging  both  household  saving  and  borrowing  in  dinars.  Aware  of  how  deep  the 
roots of euroisation are, it was clear to us that the process of dinarisation would be a long 
one, and yet we decided to go ahead with it. It is equally important that the household sector 
is not the only one to record an upturn in lending – overall lending activity has been on the 
mend  since  the  second  half  of  2015,  and  in  June  domestic  lending  to  corporates  and 
households recorded growth of 3.5% year-on-year.

  I have been serving as Governor during a period marked by anything but certainties. More 
than that, it has been a period of unpredictable and turbulent developments. And yet, in such 
circumstances,  we  have  managed  to  achieve  and  safeguard  stability  –  both  price  and 
financial. We have recently had another opportunity to see for ourselves how important the 
role  of  a  central  bank  is,  namely  when  the  United  Kingdom  voted  to  leave  the  European 
Union  and  Brexit  caused  havoc  among  investors  in  the  global  financial  market.  However, 
owing  to  our  well-timed  response,  the  Serbian  foreign  exchange  market  calmed  down 
promptly  and  the  dinar  weakened  by  0.1%  that  day.  The  following  week,  appreciation 
pressures on the dinar built up and our foreign currency purchases in July outstripped the 
sales in the entire second quarter. The result of such an approach by the National Bank of 
Serbia  was  relative  stability  of  the  exchange  rate  and  the  EUR  85  million  inflow  to foreign 
exchange reserves on account of interventions in the foreign exchange market since the start 
of 2015.  
Ladies and gentlemen, dear guests, 
I  am  hopeful  that  the  results  we  have  achieved  undeniably  attest  to  the  National  Bank  of 
Serbia’s commitment to preserving low and stable inflation and a sound financial system in 
the coming period, as this is the best way for a central bank to support economic recovery 
and further strengthening of domestic macroeconomic fundamentals.  
In a few moments, my colleagues from the Directorate for Economic Research and Statistics 
will inform you about the details of our latest projections, but I too would like to underline that 
Serbia’s macroeconomic outlook is even more favourable than it was when we last met in 
May.  We  expect  economic  growth  to  accelerate  to  2.5%  this  and  3%  next  year.  Strong 
improvement  of  fiscal  prospects  continued  into  the  second  quarter,  driven  mainly  by 
sustainable increase in tax revenues. We estimate that budget deficit will be even lower this 
year,  and  that  it  will  equal  2.5%  of  GDP.  Year-on-year  inflation  was  1.2%  in  July,  and 
according to our forecast, it will return within the target tolerance band in the first half of 2017 
and remain within the band thereafter. We expect a further reduction in the current account 
deficit – from 4.8% in 2015 to 4.2% this year, as well as that it will be fully covered by the 
inflow of foreign direct investment.  
Internal and external imbalances continue to narrow. Owing to full coordination of monetary 
and fiscal policy measures, Serbia is now much more resilient to external shocks – it boasts 
much stronger macroeconomic fundamentals and a high level of foreign exchange reserves. 
We  rarely  have  an  opportunity  to  repeatedly  revise  our  economic  projections  upward, 
therefore we are particularly pleased that the past 18 months were chiefly marked by such 
successive upward revisions. 
In the period ahead, the National Bank of Serbia will continue to closely monitor and analyse 
developments  in  the  international  financial  and  commodity  markets,  and  make  its  future 
decisions on those grounds with the aim of preserving the stability that it has achieved. 
Last but not least, having recognised the importance of communication with the public for the 
success of the bank’s policy, we are aspiring to improve it further. As the number of central 
banks  using  social  networks  as  a  communication  channel  is  increasing,  last  week  the 
National Bank of Serbia created profiles on Twitter and Facebook. I am inviting you to join 
our Twitter and Facebook pages to keep abreast of our activities by following us on these 
networks.  
Thank you for your attention.
