Assalamualaikum Wr. Wb.,
Greetings to all,
Om Swastiastu,
Namo Buddhaya,
Praise	be	to	Allah	SWT,	God	the	Almighty,	as	it	is	upon	His	blessings	that	we	may	all	
gather here today, in a good health, at the “2016 Annual Meeting of Bank Indonesia”.
I	am	grateful	and	deeply	honoured	by	the	presence	of	His	Excellency	the	President,	
and all other distinguished guests, here at the the “2016 Annual Meeting of Bank 
Indonesia”.	 The	 presence	 of	 His	 Excellency	 the	 President	 and	 of	 distinguished	
guests  testify  to  our  commitment  to  create  synergy,  to  develop  the  national 
economy,	and	to	strive	towards	equitable	welfare	for	for	the	nation.
This	commitment	will	hopefully	encourage	the	optimization	of	the	potentials	and	
the resilience of our economy, and to further promote a more efficient, productive 
and competitive national economy. 
This	evening,	allow	me	to	present	the	Bank	Indonesia’s	perspectives	on	the	latest	
economic  condition  and  the  prospects,  under  the  theme “Optimizing Potential, 
Strengthening Resilience”.	 In	 our	 view,	 the	 theme	 is	 relevant	 as	 response	 to	 the	
unfavourable global economic development, and the positive achievements of the 
domestic economy.

Developments in Global Economies
Our	 latest	 assessment	 concludes	 that	
the  the  global  economy  continues 
to	 weaken,	 which	 is	 followed	 by	 the	
continuation	 of	 the	 low	 commodity	
prices,	and	the	declining	of	capital	flows	
to	emerging	countries.	The	momentum	
for	 global	 economic	 recovery	 that	 we	
initially	 anticipated	 would	 begin	 this	
year	has	yet	to	materialize	and	is	visibly	
weakening	in	a	number	of	areas.	
We	 estimate	 global	 economic	 growth	
in	2016	to	be	at	around	3.0%,	which	is	
lower	than	in	2015	of	3.2%	(Figure	1).	In	
the  developed  countries,  the  United 
States	 (US),	 which	 was	 previously	
expected	 to	 be	 the	 engine	 of	 global	
economic	 growth,	 has	 yet	 to	 be	 solid	
in	its	development	up	to	the	First	Half	
of	2016.	Recovery	in	Europe	and	Japan	
has	 also	 yet	 to	 strengthen.	 The	 Brexit

Developments  in  Global  Economies 
including those of the emerging markets 
(Figure	4).	
 
One	 structural	 problem	 of	 the	 global	
economy	 that	 we	 need	 to	 highlight	
and  affects  emerging  markets  such  as 
Indonesia,  is  the  diminishing  impacts 
of	 the	 global	 economic	 growth	 on	
the	 world	 trade.	 Data	 shows	 that	 the	
relationship	 between	 world	 GDP	 with	
the	 volume	 of	 world	 trade	 is	 not	 as	
strong	as	it	was	in	previous	years	(Figure	
5).	 World	 economic	 growth	 elasticity	
towards	 world	 trade	 that	 since	 early	
2000	was	within	the	range	of	around	1.3	
has	weakened	and	in	the	last	five	years	
elasticity	that	occured	was	only	around	
0.9. 
Various studies have argued that there 
are  a  number  of  factors  that  led  to 
this	 condition.	 One	 of	 these	 states	
that	 this	 phenomenon	 was	 caused	 by	
the  decline  in  global  investment  and 
increased  global  trade  protectionist 
issues.  Moreover,  declining  Global 
Value	 Chain	
(GVC),	 which	 among	
others	 was	 brought	 on	 by	 a	 maturing	
process,  mastering  technology  and 
reshoring process, also further receded 
the	 relationship	 between	 the	 both	
elements. 
Structural	 global	 issues	 subsequently	
needs to be further monitored due to its 
implication on the completion process, 
which	 certainly	 cannot	 be	 carried	
out	 within	 the	 short-term.	 In	 other	
words,	 we	 will	 continue	 to	 face	 global	
economic	 downturn	 within	 a	 longer	
timeframe,	which	may	risk	spreading	to	
the  emerging  markets,  including  Asia. 
The	 global	 economic	 recovery	 up	 to	
2020	is	expected	to	continue	to	remain	
below	4%	(Figure	6).	
. 
1	The	production	maturing	process	in	a	number	of	major	countries,	such	as	China	and	the	US,	is	a	result	of	technological	mastery	that	allows	
for	foreign	input	goods	substitution	by	domestic	input.	Meanwhile,	the	reshoring	process	mainly	occuring	in	the	US	is	driven	by	the	impact	of	
increased	manufacturing	sector	labor	costs	outside	of	the	US	and	declining	energy	costs	within	the	US.

Data	 shows	 that	 the	 flexibility	 of

(Figure	 11).	 This	 condition	 is	 driven	 by	
the  positive  impact  of  the  economic 
transition taking hold in these regions, 
from  a  previous  dependence  on

Inflation also continues to be maintained 
within	a	low	and	stable	level.	We	project	
inflation	 for	 2016	 will	 be	 in	 the	 target	
range	 of	 3.0-3.2%,	 which	 is	 lower	 than	
that	 achieved	 in	 2015	 of	 3.4%	 (Figure	
9).	 This	 low	 inflation	 is	 also	 attributed	
to  the  consistency  of  monetary  policy 
and	coordination	with	the	Government	
to  control  prices  of  volatile  foods 
and  strategic  commodities.  In  spatial 
terms,	 inflation	 is	 also	 low	 with	 Java,	 a	
number  of  areas  in  Eastern  Indonesia 
and	 Lampung	 registering	 inflation	 of	
below	 3%	 (Figure	 12).	 Meanwhile,	 high	
inflationary  pressure  mainly  occured  in

registered	rates	of	above	5%.	
Two	aspects	at	the	very	least	drove	the	
national	economy’s	flexibility	in	response	
to	 the	 global	 economic	 downturn.	 The	
first	 factor	 deals	 with	 consistency	 in	
maintaining	 economic	 stability.	 The	
outcome of this consistency is reflected 
in	inflation	that	continues	to	be	low	and	
stable	(Figure	11),	the	Rupiah’s	exchange	
rate that continues to be under control, 
the	 current	 account	 deficit	 (Figure	 10)	
and  2016  budget  deficit  that  remains 
to	 be	 within	 a	 healthy	 level,	 as	 well	
as  the  banking  sector’s  resilience  and 
a  strong  financial  system.  Apart  from 
these  consistency  factors,  economic 
stability  also  attributed  to  a  stable

The	 strengthening	 and	 optimalization	
of 
the  domestic  potential  does 
not	 mean	 that	 we	 retreat	 from	 the	
global	 constellation.	 This	 means	 that	
we	 need	 to	
improve	 and	 prepare	
ourselves	 by	 utilizing	 the	 existing	
domestic potential, thereby serving as 
a  firm  basis  to  leverage  the  domestic 
economy  once  the  global  economy 
recovers. 
In	 terms	 of	 the	 domestic	 sector,	 we	
need  to  continue  to  build  a  strong 
national  industry  so  that  once  the 
global	 economy	 recovers	 we	 will	 get	
the benefit for our economy. In terms 
of	 the	 external	 sector,	 we	 need	 to	
prepare  some  leading  sectors  that 
are  competitive  in  the  global  market.

Economic Potential
We	registered	that	there	are	at	least	3	
(three)	economic	potential	that	needs	
to	be	optimized	to	support	Indonesia’s	
economic	resilience.	The	first	potential	
is  the  high  level  of  trust  and  strong 
confidence  of  the  economic  agents 
to the government and policy makers. 
We	believe	that	the	results	of	the	Tax	
Amnesty  program  is  unlikely  to  be 
accomplished	 without	 the	 high	 level	
of  trust  on  the  government’s  policy 
direction  and  Indonesia’s  economic 
prospects.

management	with	a	realistic	target	and	
medium	 to	 long-term	 vision,	 as	 well	
as  monetary  policy  that  is  committed 
to  maintain  macroeconomic  stability 
in	our	view	serves	as	one	of	the	main	
elements  for  trust  and  confidence  of 
these  economic  agents.  In  addition, 
the confidence of the economic agents 
is  also  driven  by  the  implementation 
of  the  government’s  structural  reform 
policies.
14
The	second	potential	that	has	surfaced	
and  deserves  special  note  in  2016  is 
the  emergence  of  ample  sources  of 
economic	 financing.	 We	 extend	 our	
appreciation  to  the  Government  for 
its  success  to  unravel  this  potential 
through	the	Tax	Amnesty	program.	Up	
to 14 November 2016, this program has 
successfully	 collected	 tax	 payments	
amounting	 to	 Rp94.8	 trillion,	 with	
repatriated 
to 
Rp142.7	 trillion	 and	 declared	 funds	 of	
Rp3,773.2	trillion.	The	accomplishment	
deserves  to  be  appreciated  since  the 
Tax	 Amnesty	 program	 is	 the	 most	
succesfull	program	in	the	world.	
funds  amounting 
for 
the  solid  momentum 
We	 view	 that	 this	 potential	 can	 serve	
as 
the 
Government	to	accelerate	tax	reforms	
in	Indonesia.	The	broadened	tax	base	
is	 expected	 to	 be	 followed	 by	 tax	
intensification in order to boost the role 
of	 tax	 as	 the	 source	 of	 development	
financing. 
In	 Indonesia,	 the	 role	 of	 tax	 in	 the	
development  financing  only  reached 
11%	 of	 GDP	 in	 2015,	 which	 is	 lower	
compared  to  that  achieved  by  a 
number  of  countries  in  the  region 
such  as  Singapore  and  Malaysia  that 
achieved	 around	 14%	 of	 GDP.	 We	 are	
Economic Potential
confident	 that	 the	 tax	 intensification	
through	 the	 benefit	 of	 a	 wider	 tax	
basis,	 will	 serve	 as	 a	 solid	 ground	 for	
the	 efforts	 to	 widen	 fiscal	 space	 to	
support	 economic	 growth,	 without	
jeopardizing	 the	 sustainability	 of	 its	
prospects.
The	third	potential	is	digital	technology	
that	has	rapidly	developed.	In	2016,	we	
witnessed	 that	 the	 sharing	 economy	
and  digital  economy  has  sharply 
increased  as  reflected  in  Fintech  and 
e-commerce	 activities.	 This	 positive	
development	will,	if	it	is	used	properly,	
enhance  efficiency  and 
support 
domestic economic activities. 
These	three	potentials	that	emerge	in	
2016	will,	if	it	is	effectively	and	optimally	
empowered,	strengthen	and	boost	the	
benefits	 from	 the	 existing	 domestic	
resource  potential,  specifically  human 
and natural resources.
The	 sizeable	 population	 represents	
a  huge  market  potential  to  support 
domestic demand through household 
consumption.  Moreover, 
this  huge 
market	 potential	 will	 readily	 serve	 to	
be	the	driver	for	more	sizeable	added	
value	if	it	is	subsequently	followed	by	
an  increase  in  domestic  production 
activities.

Basic Function and Principle of Policy
Going	 forward,	 we	 need	 to	 continue	
to	promote	economic	growth	so	as	to	
avoid  the  emergence  of  vicious  circle 
risk.	 The	 economic	 downturn	 poses	
a  risk  that  may  affect  corporate  and 
financial  sector  performance,  thereby 
requiring	 efforts	 to	 strengthen	 the	
economic	resilience	(Diagram	1).
Optimization	 of	 various	 domestic	
potential 
to  promote  economic 
resilience  should  refer  to  to  the  three 
basic function of public policy, namely 
(I)	stabilization	function,	(II)	allocation	
function,	
function.	
These	 three	 functions	 needs	 to	 be	
supported  by  policy  makers  through 
strengthening the regulations. 
(III)	 distribution	
17
Within	this	context,	various	policies	that	
are  aimed  at  resource  allocation  can 
be	utilized	as	instrument	of	economic	
stabilization	 through	 countercyclical	
policies and also as a tool to promote 
equitable	 distribution	 of	 economic	
development outcomes. 
We	 support	 the	 government’s	 efforts	
to	 maintain	 a	 balance	 between	
strengthening  the  role  of  government 
spending  as  a  countercyclical  policy 
instrument	 with	 efforts	 to	 maintain	
fiscal	 sustainability.	 In	 this	 context,	
we	 view	 that	 efforts	 to	 increase	 the	
composition	 of	 capital	 expenditure,	
particularly	
infrastructure	 projects,	
should	 be	 maintained.	 This	 step	 is	
needed to preserve economic stability, 
while	 simultaneously	 ensuring	
the	
resource allocation efficiency. 
In	the	short	term,	infrastructure	projects	
will	boost	the	purchasing	power	of	the	
society,  including  the  bottom  layer 
group,	 as	 the	 projects	 can	 absorb	
sizeable	amounts	of	labor.	In	line	with	
this,  vocational  education  to  address 
labor  demands 
infrastructure 
projects	as	well	as	industry,	also	needs	
for 
to be reinforced. In the medium to long 
term,	we	believe	that	the	emphasis	on	
infrastructure	 spending	 will	 positively	
improve the economy’s efficiency and 
productivity. 
In	 line	 with	 the	 spirit	 to	 maintain	
stability and promote efficient resource 
allocation,  the  spending  aiming  to 
strengthen the social safety net policy 
through the fulfillment of basic needs 
in  health  and  education  also  needs 
to	 continue.	 This	 policy	 will	 sustain	
the	 purchasing	 power	 of	 middle	 and	
lower	 layers	 of	 society.	 In	 line	 with	
this,	we	believe	that	strengthening	the	
institutions that are responsible for the 
implementation  of  the  social  safety 
net	 program	 will	 support	 government	
efforts to provide social protection. 
The	 various	 steps	 mentioned	 above	
will	 lead	 to	 improvements	 if	 it	 is	 also	
coupled	 with	 the	 policy	 aiming	 to	
promote distribution to reduce income 
gap	 and	 expand	 labor	 absorption.	
Recently,	
the	 Gini	 Ratio	 disparity	
indicator	has	already	shown	a	sloping	
trend in recent years thereby posing a

We	 believe	 that	 these	 policies	 will

on	 a	 technical	 level,	 which	 can	 be

the	need	to	harmonize	policy	between	
authorities in formulating interest rates, 
such as monetary policy rates, deposit

and	
This	 policy	 direction	 will	 be	 carried	
out	 by	 optimizing	 Bank	 Indonesia’s

monetary,	 macroprudential,	 as	 well	
as	 payment	 systems	 and	 Rupiah

In  regards  to  monetary  operations

Macro  prudential  policy 
in  2017 
will	 constantly	 be	 directed	 towards

To	 support	 these	 priority	 initiatives,	
Bank

support  from  the  related  authorities. 
The	 first	 is	 to	 align	 tax	 regulations

of	 micro	 credit	 (KUR).	 Bank	 Indonesia	
supports	 the	 channeling	 of	 the	 new

Nevertheless,	 we	 see	 that	 there	 is	
considerable  room  for  improvement 
to  appropriately  and  accurately  make 
KUR	more	well-targeted.
Among	 the	 few	 things	 that	 require	
attention  is  the  tendency  of  shifting 
small	business	borrowers	of	commercial	
banks,  rural  banks,  cooperatives,  and 
other non banking financial institutions 
to	the	KUR	program.	This	shifting	may	
result	in	the	KUR	goal	to	provide	eased

Policy Coordination
We	 are	 fully	 aware	 that	 sharing	 a	
common	 view	 and	 harmonious	 steps	
is  needed  to  achieve  our  common 
aspirations.	In	line	with	this,	the	various	
policies that Bank Indonesia intends to 
carry	 out	 will	 likely	 be	 synergized	 and	
coordinated	 with	 the	 various	 policy	
makers,	both	in	the	central	as	well	as	in	
the regional levels, so as to ensure its 
effective implementation.
We	 intend	 to	 intensify	 coordination	
that	 we	 have	 effectively	 implemented	
to  date  through  various  forms  of 
coordination	such	as	the	Round	Table

Bank Indonesia has carried out various
