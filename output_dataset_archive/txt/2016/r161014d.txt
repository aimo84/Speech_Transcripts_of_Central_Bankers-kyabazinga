 Abstract 
In this paper we explore the nexus between cross-border trade integration and monetary 
policy. We first review the evidence that trade liberalization has increased the degree of 
integration in North America and conclude that, while robust structural inferences remain 
elusive,  there  is  sufficient  supporting  evidence  for  central  banks  to  treat  the  issue 
seriously.  The  paper  then  discusses  several  channels  by  which  increased  integration 
might  affect  macroeconomic  models.  We  introduce  modifications  to  the  Bank  of 
Canada’s  main  policy  model,  ToTEM,  to  capture  some  of  the  impacts  of  integration 
suggested in the literature and generate stochastic simulations to compare versions of the 
model  with  low  and  high  integration.  The  main  conclusion  is  that  increased  integration 
may  make  it  more  challenging  for  central  banks  to  control  inflation,  in  the  sense  that 
doing so will require more variability in interest rates, exchange rates and the output gap.

Résumé 
Dans  le  présent  document,  nous  étudions  le  lien  entre  l’intégration  du  commerce 
transfrontalier  et  la  politique  monétaire.  Nous  examinons  d’abord  les  indications  d’un 
accroissement du degré d’intégration en Amérique du Nord induit par la libéralisation des 
échanges  et  concluons  que,  si  des  inférences  structurelles  robustes  restent  difficiles  à 
cerner,  la  preuve  recueillie  est  suffisante  pour  inciter  les  banques  centrales  à  prendre  la 
question  au  sérieux.  Puis,  nous  décrivons  plusieurs  canaux  par  lesquels  l’intégration 
accrue  peut  se  répercuter  sur  les  modèles  macroéconomiques.  Nous  donnons  un  aperçu  
des  modifications  apportées  à  TOTEM,  le  principal  modèle  macroéconomique  de  la 
Banque du Canada, pour tenir compte de certains des effets de l’intégration mentionnés 
dans  la  littérature,  puis  générons  des  stimulations  stochastiques  pour  comparer  des 
versions  du  modèle  comportant  un  degré  d’intégration  faible  ou  élevé.  La  conclusion 
principale est que l’intégration accrue pourrait compliquer la tâche des banques centrales 
lorsqu’il s’agit de maîtriser l’inflation, car une plus grande variabilité des taux d’intérêt, 
des taux de change et de l’écart de production serait alors nécessaire.

 Introduction 
 
Paul Storer was a special fellow. We met back in 1984 when he was fresh out of the 
Master’s program at the University of Toronto, and I was fortunate that he chose to 
accept an appointment in my group at the Bank of Canada. I know I helped influence his 
decision to go back to school three years later for his PhD, and his choice of the 
University of Western Ontario, now known somewhat ironically as Western University. 
While he was there, I was able to visit him from time to time, and it was a pleasure 
watching him grow. 
 
Sincere, dedicated, thoughtful, skeptical—these are some of the words I would readily 
use to describe Paul. But most importantly, he was a very nice person, highly likeable 
and a joy to work with. It never seems fair when we lose someone like Paul, but, to me, 
this loss seems especially so, for we barely managed to stay in touch after he and his 
wife Tina moved to Bellingham. Email from time to time, and a beer or dinner when he 
and Tina were in Ottawa, it was always great to catch up, and now I treasure those 
memories even more. 
 
I’m very touched to have been invited to give today’s lecture in Paul’s memory, and I 
wanted badly to do something that Paul would have appreciated. Fortunately, Paul had 
wide-ranging research interests, so I had a lot to choose from. But he had clearly settled 
onto Canada–US relations, particularly trade issues, as a core interest. And, his first full-
time job was in monetary policy. So, today I have chosen to explore an issue he cared 
about deeply—cross-border trade integration—and to do so through the lens of a 
monetary policy practitioner. 
 
Let me offer a quick sketch of my narrative. Paul had a strong interest in whether the 
trade liberalization of the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA), and the later 
move to NAFTA, had actually led to increased integration of our two economies. His 
work, often with Steven Globerman (see, for example, Globerman and Storer 2004), 
finds little definitive evidence of increased integration of the Canada-US economies in 
the wake of either CUSFTA or NAFTA. This seems to be the case whether you investigate 
trade flows, investment flows, labour mobility, or the convergence in prices or factor 
input prices. 
 
At the same time, some of their findings suggest that the issue may be too complex and 
the demands on the data too great to support rigorous empirical inference. In 
particular, there are some large shifts in trade patterns at the sectoral level, suggestive 
of increased specialization and more trade in components—in short, “supply chaining.” 
Moreover, as Globerman and Storer themselves observed, periodic significant 
fluctuations in the Canada–US exchange rate, combined with a degree of domestic price 
stickiness, are likely to pose challenges for empirical work around integration.  
 
 1 
 In what follows I will build on some of those observations and argue that there is more 
(albeit soft) evidence of increased trade integration when the definition of trade is 
broadened to embrace all the dimensions of international business. This includes 
widespread supply chaining and the establishment of foreign affiliates selling directly to 
host markets or third markets; in other words, globalization in its various forms. Indeed, 
it is important not to restrict attention to the three NAFTA partner countries, since 
additional countries (for example, China) may be important facilitators of integration 
within North America. Statistical agencies are still catching up to these business trends, 
so, by necessity, much of the evidence we will bring to the matter will be indirect. We 
make no rigorous empirical claims, especially related to the effects of specific trade 
agreements, but suggest that the evidence of increased integration is sufficient for 
monetary policy to take it seriously. 
 
This issue intersects with monetary policy along at least two dimensions. First, monetary 
policy formulation depends heavily on empirical economic models, and the evolution of 
international business is certain to have consequences for model structure and for key 
model parameters. For example, domestic inflation may come to be driven more by 
global demand and supply, and less by domestic forces. As well, the effects of 
fluctuations in domestic interest rates and exchange rates on the domestic economy 
may diminish as economies become more integrated.  
 
The second dimension relates to monetary policy strategy, including both the 
appropriate choice of target for the central bank to aim at and the time horizon over 
which it should attempt to exert control. In attempting to smooth real economic 
fluctuations—with the goal of achieving an inflation target—the central bank creates 
interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations. These fluctuations may need to be greater 
in a world where increased cross-border integration has weakened some of the key 
macroeconomic linkages relied upon by central banks. These shifting trade-offs need to 
be well understood in order to frame appropriate policy choices. We will explore these 
policy issues using a state-of-the-art macro model of the Canadian economy. 
 
Trade Evolution and Economic Integration 
 
We begin by describing the various ways in which trade has evolved in North America 
during the past 30 years. The concept of “trade penetration” is one useful proxy for the 
importance of international trade for the domestic economy since it goes beyond the 
traditional concept of exports. We use a country’s nominal exports plus its imports as a 
share of nominal GDP to measure the importance or “penetration” of trade into 
domestic value creation, focusing on trade in goods for convenience. In a globalized 
world, where production processes are often geographically fragmented, the 
competitiveness of a country’s exports depends increasingly on inputs imported from 
other countries, since that facilitates the division of labour between lower-wage and 
higher-wage workers. Clearly, this fragmentation boosts international trade for a given 
level of GDP. In effect, we trade parts, and then we trade the final products, which 
 2 
 implicitly means trading the parts again (Hummels, Ishi and Kei-Mu 2001; Yi 2003; Chen, 
Kondratowicz and Kei-Mu 2005). 
 
Chart 1 offers some data on trade penetration of goods for the world and for the three 
NAFTA economies. At the global level, trade penetration rose steadily from the early 
1990s through to the collapse in trade after the global financial crisis in 2007–08. There 
was a recovery in trade penetration after the ensuing global recession, but since 2010 
total trade has been flat or even declining slightly in importance to global GDP. 
 
The weakness of global trade growth in the past few years has attracted considerable 
attention (Francis and Morel 2015; Poloz 2016). A key reason seems to be that 
globalization has happened in waves that cannot be expected to be repeated. Early 
development of global value chains (GVCs) was mainly the product of technological 
improvements and falling tariffs and other costs, such as transportation and logistical 
support costs. GVC development received a major boost when China joined the World 
Trade Organization (WTO), which, again, can only happen once (Ferrantino and Taglioni 
2014; Constantinescu, Matoo and Ruta 2015). A second reason is that the world has 
entered a phase of subdued business investment because of the weight of post-crisis 
uncertainty, and investment spending is a very trade-intensive activity. Accordingly, soft 
investment has a disproportionate effect on global trade flows (Morel 2015). A third 
reason, offered by Stratford (2015), is that emerging markets generally have lower 
import elasticities than advanced economies; consequently, as the relative contribution 
of emerging economies to global GDP growth rises, the global income elasticity of trade 
has been declining. It is therefore reasonable to expect global trade to pick up as the 
world economy gathers momentum; but it seems less likely to exceed global GDP 
growth to the same extent as in the past. 
 
This global pattern in trade penetration has been mimicked by the US economy. Canada 
and Mexico have had different experiences, however. Mexico has seen a steady rise in 
trade penetration for more than 30 years, with a big acceleration coming on the heels of 
NAFTA in 1994. There was a minor decline in trade in the wake of the global financial 
crisis, but the uptrend resumed right afterward. In contrast, Canada saw no rise in trade 
penetration in the immediate aftermath of CUSFTA in 1988 (indeed, trade penetration 
was in a downtrend) but then saw a rapid rise in trade penetration from 1991–2000. 
NAFTA may have contributed to this rise after 1994, but the fact that much of the 1990s 
increase in trade penetration was unwound during the following decade suggests that 
other forces may have been at work. One contributing factor was the global telecom 
boom and subsequent bust, in which certain Canadian companies were active 
participants. Another was the steady appreciation of the Canadian dollar from 2002 to 
2008, and its persistent strength in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. This 
resilience was mainly the product of high oil prices, which led to considerable 
restructuring in many export sectors, including automobiles and forestry products, and 
the outright exit of large numbers of exporting companies. The US business cycle was 
 3 
 also a contributor. Since 2010, a modest uptrend in trade penetration has resumed in 
Canada.

By this simple measure then, one would conclude that the three NAFTA countries have 
become more integrated with the global economy during the past 30 years, especially 
Mexico. The latter observation fits one’s priors that smaller countries tend to have the 
most to gain from trade liberalization. It is also consistent with empirical evidence in 
Romalis (2007), showing that export volumes between these countries increased 
significantly because of NAFTA. See also Caliendo and Parro (2015), who develop a 
calibrated model suggesting that NAFTA augmented intra–North American trade by  
118 per cent for Mexico, 41 per cent for the United States, and 11 per cent for Canada.  
 
The implications of these trends for goods exports in the three NAFTA economies are 
illustrated in Chart 2. Exports as a share of GDP have almost doubled in the United 
States in the past 30 years but have been showing weakness recently. Mexico has seen a 
steady rise in exporting, particularly in the wake of NAFTA, and today has an export-to-
GDP ratio approaching 35 per cent. In contrast, the export sector trauma of the 2000s 
has taken Canada’s export-to-GDP ratio from a high of 37 per cent to about 26 per 
cent—albeit resuming a modest uptrend—today.

Last observation: 2015 
  
The concept of total trade penetration embodies the idea that countries trade not just 
in final goods but in the components that go into them. Indeed, this is the essence of 
the benefits of globalization. A given product can be fragmented into various 
components, some of which require highly skilled, highly paid workers and some which 
can be mass produced at low cost in lower-wage locations. Trade connects these 
fragments together into GVCs and permits better matching between skills and products 
and therefore lower overall costs and higher productivity. GVCs clearly boost 
conventional trade statistics for a given unit of GDP and make interpretation of those 
statistics more difficult. 
 
One way to tackle this issue and gain insight into the degree of cross-border integration 
is to examine the flow of intermediate goods between countries. After all, consumers 
are not interested in intermediate goods, only the finished product. Trade in 
intermediate goods is, therefore, business to business and productivity-enhancing. 
Chart 3 shows the trends in global trade in intermediate goods for the NAFTA countries. 
 
These data show that there has been a strong tendency for trade in intermediate goods 
to grow in all three countries. While all three have seen an uptrend since NAFTA, the 
large acceleration after 2000 suggests that the bigger influence may have been China’s 
accession to the WTO. The level of intermediate goods trade for the United States 
dwarfs that for Canada and Mexico by factors of four and seven, respectively. The 
importance of intermediate goods trade to the US economy is consistent with its role as 
a global hub for multinational enterprises (MNEs) that develop GVCs spanning multiple 
countries, including its NAFTA partners. Although it would be difficult to disentangle 
 5 
 these data, they are at least consistent with a rising degree of North American 
integration over the past 20 years.

Last observation: 2014 
  
Trade in intermediate goods goes far beyond refined raw materials or minor parts to 
include full subsystems. Trade in automobiles provides an illustration: a very large 
portion of the total value added in an automobile comes from the parts and subsystems 
made by manufacturers in the supply chain, whether they are building engines, 
transmissions, electronic systems or even glass. Final assembly of vehicles is in fact a 
relatively low value-added activity today—amounting to well under 10 per cent of the 
final value of the automobile—with much more value added embedded in the parts and 
subsystems made by suppliers. Aircraft manufacturing is broadly similar in this respect. 
 
Supply-chain trade often happens within the same firm, the trade-facilitated version of 
vertical integration. Thus, the MNE creates (or purchases) entities that supply it, thereby 
increasing reliability, maximizing efficiency and perhaps internalizing the value added 
(and profitability) that lies in the supply chain. Such arrangements are very clear in the 
manufacturing sector of the NAFTA countries. For the United States, some 40 per cent 
of manufactured exports to Canada are intra-firm, and about 50 per cent of imports 
from Canada are also intra-firm. Similarly, around 40 per cent of US manufactured 
exports to Mexico are intra-firm, but a much higher proportion of US imports from 
Mexico—70 per cent—are intra-firm. These data point to a very high level of cross-
border integration, at least in certain manufacturing sectors, including automobiles, 
aerospace and telecommunications equipment. 
 
 6 
 As noted earlier, trade through a value chain creates some double-counting, or perhaps 
more appropriately multi-counting, of trade flows, because the same items cross 
borders more than once. Consider a mobile phone, designed and engineered in one 
country, assembled in another country from components produced in several other 
supplier countries and then sold to the entire world. Even in this relatively simple 
example, parts of the phone cross borders more than once, and each time that value is 
recorded as someone’s export. What this means is that any change in the structure of 
global value chains can either inflate or depress normal “gross” trade flows. 
 
In an effort to understand these phenomena better, the Organisation for Economic  
Co-operation and Development (OECD) has developed indicators of “trade in value-
added terms,” which attempt to capture the value added in each country’s participation 
in a value chain. Viewed from the domestic lens, building a global value chain means 
outsourcing content of the final product, thereby reducing its domestic content. The 
OECD data show that 45 of 61 economies have seen a decline in the domestic content of 
their exports over the past 20 years (Chart 4). This includes Mexico, where the 
maquiladoras (suppliers clustered near the Mexico–US border) have captured 
considerable offshoring activity from US and Canadian firms. Indeed, the maquiladoras 
today account for over 25 per cent of manufacturing employment in Mexico (Bergin, 
Feenstra and Hanson 2009), while at the same time incorporating imported inputs from 
Asia and elsewhere in Latin America.

While these observations fit our hypothesis of increased integration across a large 
number of economies, two exceptions are worth noting. One is Canada, where there 
has been a modest increase in domestic value added to total exports. The reason for 
this is that Canada’s growth engine during much of the 2002–12 period was in the 
commodity sector—primarily oil—and this is of course largely domestic value added. 
Data from Canada’s manufacturing sector clearly show a declining portion of domestic 
value added, reflecting a globalization trend (Chart 5). The other interesting exception is 
China, which has been by far the most important recipient of GVC business, often in 
very labour-intensive forms. This means that the explosion of global trade in the wake of 
China’s accession to the WTO has contained a large share of Chinese domestic value 
added. Over time, however, China has been creeping up the value-added chain, 
particularly in manufacturing, as Chart 5 illustrates.  
 
Yet another indicator of rising cross-border integration is the growing importance of 
foreign affiliates in facilitating trade. A domestic company has a choice of producing at 
home and shipping abroad, or locating abroad and shipping directly to that host country 
and to third countries. Either arrangement may be supported by a global value chain. 
Importantly, both CUSFTA and NAFTA liberalized and offered legal protection of cross-
border investment, so to understand the effects of these agreements we need to look 
beyond the cross-border flows of goods and services. 
 
Data on the operations of foreign affiliates with domestic majority ownership are less 
widely available and reported with a substantial lag. That being said, by 2013, sales by 
Canadian-owned foreign affiliates almost matched the amount of total exports sold 
from Canada, at Can$510 billion versus Can$573 billion, respectively. In effect, there is 
 8 
 almost as large a Canadian economy operating in foreign countries as there is in the 
domestic export sector, creating jobs and GDP both domestically and abroad. Canadian-
owned affiliates operating in the United States account for about half of this total 
activity and employ some 600,000 people in the United States; Canadian operations in 
Mexico generate sales of about Can$15 billion and employ nearly 70,000 people in that 
country. The number of associated jobs in Canada is much more difficult to estimate. 
 
Importantly, the corresponding US figures are an order of magnitude greater. US 
affiliates operating abroad generate annual sales of some US$6 trillion, with over 
US$600 billion of that taking place in Canada, and over US$200 billion in Mexico. These 
are very large numbers; at a minimum, they imply that standard export and import data 
provide a very incomplete picture of the complexity of international business 
relationships. 
 
While these observations are not definitive, they collectively support the view that 
cross-border integration has increased in North America over the past 20 years. As 
mentioned above, deeper structural evidence of increased integration is harder to come 
by, especially related to specific trade agreements. This is probably because the effects 
of trade agreements are highly sector-specific, often even firm-specific, and there are 
always numerous other forces that affect macro statistics. For example, some sectors 
may have been more protected than others before a trade agreement, so outsized 
adjustments may be masked in the aggregate data. Shifts in industry composition or in 
factor intensity can easily distort micro phenomena when aggregated into macro 
statistics. And, there may be subsequent shocks that hit particular industries. 
 
Nevertheless, the literature has built a number of insights on the effects of specific trade 
agreements over time. For example, in the wake of CUSFTA, Canada’s manufacturing 
sector saw a 5 per cent drop in employment and a 6 per cent increase in productivity. 
Looking at a finer level of detail, those industries with the deepest tariff cuts saw a drop 
in employment by some 12 per cent and a rise in productivity of around 15 per cent. 
Importantly, these employment effects were erased over the longer term, as job gains 
were made in other manufacturing companies (Trefler 2004; Lileeva 2008). In related 
work, Lileeva and Trefler (2008) show that improved access to foreign markets induces 
productivity-enhancing investment. McCalman and Spearot (2013, 2015) provide 
evidence that US firms in the auto sector re-configured their GVCs in response to 
NAFTA. Mexico was an important beneficiary. Many of these changes are most dramatic 
at the firm level, which underscores the role of intra-industry reallocation in facilitating 
structural adjustment to trade liberalization (Melitz 2003).   
 
As for convergence in factor pricing, Caliendo and Parro (2015) find that NAFTA lowered 
the terms of trade for Canada by 0.1 per cent and for Mexico by 0.4 per cent, while 
raising the US terms of trade very slightly. Although real wages increased for all three 
economies, Mexico showed the largest gains—weakly suggestive of some degree of 
factor price convergence. The generally positive income effect of trade liberalization 
 9 
 highlighted in the basic model of trade (Krugman 1980) receives surprisingly little 
attention. The main channel for this effect is falling import prices, and the positive effect 
of lower import prices on domestic purchasing power can be easily lost in the debate 
about how domestic producers will compete and how many domestic jobs may be lost. 
Job losses may not be well captured by import price indexes when a central result of 
trade liberalization is an increase in the number and variety of products that become 
available to domestic consumers (Feenstra 1994; Kehoe and Ruhl 2013). Another 
complicating factor in this research is the possibility that profit margins may not be 
constant, which may weaken the pass through of decreases in costs that come from 
trade liberalization to domestic consumers (De Loecker et al. 2012).  
 
Summing up, a broad-brush review of data on international business and the empirical 
literature demonstrates substantial evidence that that cross-border trade integration 
has increased in the past 20 years. At the same time, it remains possible to be skeptical 
of the depth of the integration hypothesis, especially attempts to credit either CUSFTA 
or NAFTA specifically with the observed trends in the trade data, since definitive 
structural empirical evidence to support it is limited. Certainly, the impact of the two 
agreements on trade seems to have fallen short of predictions made by proponents 
during pre-agreement debate. 
 
Furthermore, some would point to recent evidence of integration reversals, as certain 
industries have “reshored” back to the United States. However, it is important to keep 
such anecdotes in perspective; globalization was never likely to take us to an idyllic end-
state of pure integration, since the realities of international commerce continue to 
intrude. These realities include the limited availability of trade finance in many smaller 
countries, the costs of building and maintaining global logistics networks, geopolitical 
risks, the preference to have suppliers closer to buyers, and long-distance after-sales 
service and maintenance, just to name a few. 
 
Most importantly, perhaps, the trend to factor equalization—although not proven, it is 
easy to see rising wages in China or Mexico, for example—creates a new optimization 
problem for MNEs with GVCs whenever a company undertakes periodic strategic 
reviews of its cross-border structure. Such reviews can lead (and have led) to decisions 
to re-shore parts of the supply chain back to the home country—in short, the optimal 
supply-chain arrangement can vary considerably over time as underlying conditions 
evolve. This means that the degree of integration may also vary significantly over time, 
in both directions, making it risky to treat it as a permanent state of the world. 
 
My overall reading is that the evidence of increased international integration is 
sufficiently compelling for policy-makers to take it seriously, since it may affect their 
policy models and decision-making frameworks. These issues are explored in the next 
section.

 Integration and the Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism 
 
It is easiest to think about the implications of these trends in international trade in the 
context of a textbook open-economy model with inflation driven by a Phillips curve and 
the central bank targeting inflation. In this framework, a macroeconomic shock moves 
projected inflation off target and the central bank adjusts interest rates in a manner that 
brings inflation back to target over the next six-to-eight quarters. For ease of exposition, 
assume a negative shock to foreign demand, prompting the central bank to cut interest 
rates to keep inflation on target. 
 
The interest rate response of the central bank works mainly through intertemporal 
substitution by both consumers and firms, who borrow more and spend more on goods, 
housing and investments. Meanwhile, the cut in interest rates is associated with some 
depreciation in the domestic currency, which boosts exports and dampens imports, 
broadening the policy effect on aggregate demand. The weaker currency may also have 
partially offsetting effects on consumer spending and investment spending because of 
the higher cost of imports. The depreciation of the exchange rate boosts domestic 
inflation temporarily. However, the increase in domestic aggregate demand combined 
with these other effects offsets the drop in foreign demand and brings inflation 
sustainably back to target. 
 
The monetary policy transmission mechanism relies in the first instance on two key 
reduced-form parameters: the interest elasticity of aggregate demand and the exchange 
rate elasticity of aggregate demand. The issue to consider is how the evolution of 
international trade may have influenced these parameters over time, either directly, or 
through more subtle changes in the underlying structure of the economy. The ultimate 
effects on inflation will depend on the interaction between the domestic output gap and 
domestic inflation (the Phillips curve). Each of these relationships may be altered by an 
increase in cross-border integration. 
 
To illustrate, let’s compare a world in which entire products are produced in individual 
countries and exported to others, with one that is “integrated” or “globalized,” 
dominated by MNEs with suppliers scattered around the world. In both states, global 
demand for a given product is the ultimate demand shock variable. However, the 
investment decisions of an MNE will be driven more by global variables than individual 
domestic variables. This could include interest rate fluctuations—assuming the MNE has 
access to global capital markets, its decision making may be less influenced by domestic 
interest rates and more by global interest rates. To date, however, there is very little 
empirical evidence for or against this conjecture, so we have set it aside. 
 
Similarly, a fluctuation in an individual exchange rate may have a more muted impact on 
MNEs in a globalized world, because for any given MNE built on GVCs, the depreciation 
of one currency means an appreciation of another, both of which could be in the firm’s 
portfolio of demand and supply. In concrete terms, as a country becomes more 
 11 
 integrated into GVCs, a depreciation of the exchange rate improves its competitiveness 
by only a fraction of the value of final goods exports, rather than the whole bundle 
(Ahmed, Appendino and Ruta 2015). Furthermore, notice that the process of building a 
GVC involves increasing the degree of specialization at each point in the supply chain. 
This specialization presumably reduces the substitutability of producers across 
countries, thereby providing a second structural reason why the exchange rate elasticity 
of exports may decline with increased trade integration. 
 
In related literature, Caselli et al. (2015) show that sectors that are more open to trade 
are less exposed to domestic supply and demand shocks and tend to be less correlated 
with the rest of the economy. Further, sectors that are more open to trade tend to be 
more specialized and more volatile (di Giovanni and Levchenko 2009). And, countries 
that trade more tend to exhibit higher business-cycle synchronization (di Giovanni and 
Levchenko 2010; Liao and Santacreu 2015). Given these inferences, it is not surprising to 
find that globalization has made domestic inflation more sensitive to global demand 
developments and less sensitive to domestic disturbances (BIS 2016, 68). In other 
words, the global output gap may become a more important determinant of domestic 
inflation, at the expense of the domestic output gap. 
 
Another important structural channel to consider is the linkage between cross-border 
integration and income distribution. It is generally understood that increased trade 
penetration and specialization leads to the offshoring of labour-intensive, lower-
productivity fragments of the supply process. This leads to higher average productivity 
levels and higher incomes domestically. Logically, it may also lead to an increase in 
domestic income dispersion, a widely observed stylized fact of the past 20 years and 
much discussed in the United States. 
 
Based on a model developed by Krugman (2008), Bivens (2007) concludes that trade 
restructuring may account for about 15 to 20 per cent of the observed increase in 
income dispersion. Others have found evidence that this linkage may be even more 
pronounced for developing countries; for example, Mexico experienced a significant 
increase in income inequality soon after trade liberalization (Goldberg and Pavcnik 
2007). It is evident that the situation varies tremendously from one country to another, 
in part because the implications of trade liberalization for a given country depend on 
what other policies are implemented concurrently or subsequently. Further, income 
distribution outcomes that are sometimes attributed to globalization are often driven by 
other factors, particularly technological change (Autor, Dorn and Hanson 2015; 
Harrigan, Reshef and Toubal 2016). 
 
Chart 6 shows one summary income distribution statistic, the ratio of the income share 
of the top 10 per cent to that of the bottom 10 per cent, for the NAFTA countries. All 
three showed an increase in income dispersion during the 1990s. This trend has 
continued into the 2000s for the United States, but has partly reversed in Canada and 
has more than fully reversed in Mexico. Of course, since other elements of the policy 
 12 
 architecture that affect income distribution have not remained constant through this 
period, we make no claim that these patterns are driven by trade.

Shifts in income distribution could have implications for the standard open-economy 
models that policy-makers rely on. Since they may have less access to credit, low-
income groups are more likely to be credit constrained and therefore less likely to be 
influenced by intertemporal substitution than high-income groups. Meanwhile, high-
income groups tend to make their spending plans independently of the level of interest 
rates. An increase in income dispersion, then, could increase the share of the population 
that is less influenced by interest rate fluctuations, perhaps pointing to a lower interest 
elasticity of consumption in aggregate. 
 
There is limited empirical evidence of this conjecture to date. However, it is important 
to acknowledge that the level of empirical confidence in estimates of the interest 
elasticity of aggregate demand is not high to start with. There is evidence that low-
income households have a higher marginal propensity to consume out of their 
disposable incomes than high-income households (Blundell, Browning and Meghir 1994; 
Guvenen 2006; Parker et al. 2013). While weakly supportive of the conjecture of a lower 
sensitivity to interest rate movements in partial equilibrium, this evidence also suggests 
that once the income effects from interest rate movements are factored in, low-income 
households won’t necessarily adjust their spending by less than their high-income 
counterparts. Indeed, Kaplan and Violante (2014) offer a model in which increased 
income dispersion may actually increase interest sensitivity of consumption indirectly 
through a higher average income elasticity. 
 
 13 
 In principle, the interest elasticity of aggregate demand represents an amalgam of a 
spectrum of actors, not a representative agent. The importance of this issue depends on 
how significant the underlying heterogeneity might be. A more promising line of inquiry 
might be to model income distribution explicitly, and to simulate the effects of an 
increase in income dispersion due to globalization in the model. A rough attempt to do 
so is explored in the next section. 
 
Monetary Policy Implications of Rising Integration 
 
In this section we use the Bank of Canada’s macroeconomic policy model, ToTEM (for 
Terms-of-Trade Economic Model) to investigate how increased cross-border integration 
may affect monetary policy transmission. 
 
ToTEM is a large-scale multi-sector dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium (DSGE) 
model that reflects the consensus view of the key macroeconomic linkages in the 
Canadian economy (Murchison and Rennison 2006; Dorich et al. 2013). It contains 
sufficient detail to allow us to illustrate the range of possible interactions between 
cross-border integration and monetary policy. This includes separate modelling of the 
commodity and non-commodity export sectors and the production of domestic 
consumer goods and services. ToTEM also models consumption behaviour with two 
groups of consumers, one of them credit constrained. Members of the latter group 
consume all disposable income each period and therefore do not react directly to 
changes in interest rates, but instead react only to secondary movements in income that 
are induced by interest rate fluctuations. Although the trade literature does not suggest 
that increasing the share of credit-constrained consumers is an implication of increased 
trade integration, it can serve as a crude proxy for increased income dispersion and yield 
a preliminary insight into the matter. 
 
To study the effects of rising cross-border integration then, we compare a base version 
of the model with a version featuring five changes to the model structure. These 
changes reflect the conjectures of the preceding section and are as follows: 
 
1.  A lower exchange rate elasticity of non-commodity export demand 
2.  A higher share of imported inputs into the production of non-commodity 
exports, reflecting the development of GVCs 
3.  A higher share of imported inputs into the production of domestic consumer 
goods, reflecting the development of GVCs 
4.  A lower elasticity of substitution between domestic inputs and imported inputs 
into the production of non-commodity exports, reflecting increased 
specialization 
5.  A higher share of credit-constrained consumers, to proxy for an increased 
dispersion of income 
  14 
 We subject the two versions of the model to the same series of exogenous shocks and 
compare the model responses. Throughout, monetary policy is guided by the 
maintenance of the inflation target. Our conjecture is that increased integration will 
make the economy less responsive to both interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations, 
thereby making inflation targeting more challenging. In both versions of the model, the 
central bank is equally successful in offsetting fluctuations in inflation relative to its 
inflation target, so we compare the variability in interest rates, exchange rates and the 
output gap that are necessary to ensure this outcome. 
 
Our conjectures are shown in Chart 7 based on the response of the two versions of the 
model to an exogenous decrease in global demand. The specific form of the shock is a 
decline in foreign demand that builds to -1.2 per cent after six quarters and then 
gradually returns to control over the next five years. The deviations of inflation from 
target in the two versions of the model are very similar and modest, since the central 
bank policy objective is the same in both models. As expected, the central bank cuts 
interest rates in response to the shock somewhat more aggressively in the version of 
the model with higher cross-border integration. In contrast, the reaction of the real 
exchange rate to the shock is much greater in the high-integration version of the model, 
and the domestic real economic downturn much deeper and more prolonged.  
 
These observations are generally in line with our conjectures and are aligned with the 
results of Woodford (2007), that a more highly integrated global economy will make it 
more challenging for central banks to stabilize economic growth while pursuing inflation 
targets. In effect, rising integration loosens the connection between the domestic 
output gap and domestic inflation. Both versions of the model see a significant decline 
in exports when foreign demand falls, albeit more so in the high-integration version. 
This decline produces a deterioration in the current account balance, and the resulting 
wealth effects cause the path of consumption and therefore GDP to remain below 
control for an extended period of time. In short, it takes the economy several years to 
adjust fully to the shock, regardless of the level of cross-border integration. 
 
These insights may be generalized by calculating unconditional variances for the model’s 
key variables for a given array of historical exogenous shocks. In effect, we generate 
macroeconomic data by running the same historical shocks through both versions of the 
model and compare the resulting variances of key variables between versions. Table 1 
summarizes the results of this exercise.

The results from ToTEM suggest that higher trade integration may be associated with 
higher variability of interest rates, real exchange rates and the output gap, although the 
effect on interest rate variability is quite modest. The relatively large increase in real 
exchange rate variability is related to the complexity of stock-flow interactions in the 
model. In ToTEM, any shock that leads to a deterioration of the current account will put 
downward pressure on the real exchange rate until the country’s net foreign asset 
position stabilizes, and this process requires a bigger exchange rate movement when 
the economy is more integrated. 
 
ToTEM also suggests that the output gap will be more variable when trade integration is 
high. Since the variability of inflation is the same in both versions of the model, this 
means that greater trade integration also changes the nature of the trade-off between 
output and inflation stabilization, in effect making it more challenging to stabilize the 
economy while pursuing an inflation target. Increasing globalization, then, may be an 
argument for allowing more flexibility in inflation targets in order to produce less 
variability in the real economy. 
 
We also performed this exercise with versions of the model looking at the five model 
changes separately and then decomposed the changes in variance associated with 
globalization into the five components. These results are provided in Table 2.

Description of model changes: 
Change 1: A lower exchange rate elasticity of non-commodity export demand  
Change 2: A higher share of imported inputs in the production of non-commodity exports 
Change 3: A higher share of imported inputs in the production of domestic consumer goods 
Change 4: A lower elasticity of substitution between domestic inputs and imported inputs in the production of  
non-commodity exports 
Change 5: A higher share of credit-constrained consumers 
 
 17 
 As expected, the reduction in the exchange rate elasticity of export demand plays an 
important role in generating higher variances in interest rates, exchange rates and the 
output gap. Comparatively speaking, increases in the share of imported inputs in 
domestic production of either non-commodity exports or domestic consumption goods 
has only modest effects on the variances. Increased specialization in domestic 
production, modelled as a lower elasticity of substitution between domestic and import 
inputs, generated significantly higher exchange rate variability but has limited effects on 
the variance of interest rates or the real economy. Finally, higher income dispersion—
modelled here crudely as an increase in the share of credit-constrained consumers—has 
its primary effect by reducing the economy’s interest elasticity, as expected. This 
generates higher variability in both interest rates and the output gap but leads to very 
little change in exchange rate outcomes. 
 
The relative variances generated by ToTEM offer trade-offs that could be considered 
strategically when designing macroeconomic policies. In particular, the relative 
variances could be influenced through the complementary use of policy instruments 
other than monetary policy, such as automatic fiscal stabilizers or macroprudential 
policies. Alternatively, policy-makers could consider allowing additional flexibility in the 
central bank’s inflation objective—a widening of inflation-target bands, for example, or 
allowing a longer period to pass before a complete return to target after a shock. Such a 
change would allow the variance of inflation to increase and the variances of the other 
key variables to decrease. Such trade-offs would be very difficult to formalize ex ante, 
however, and may best be considered within the risk-management problem faced by all 
central banks. This is especially true given that such risk management must occur in a 
forward-looking fashion in the presence of considerable uncertainty regarding model 
structure and the nature of shocks. 
 
Conclusion  
 
It is an article of faith among most economists that trade liberalization will lead firms 
and households to reoptimize their behaviour and will manifest itself in increased 
integration of economies. The aggregate economic gains from such a shift are widely 
acknowledged, as are the potential effects on income distribution. 
 
Nevertheless, the real world is sufficiently complex, and so many things are not being 
held constant, that proving such conjectures empirically can be very difficult. My good 
friend Paul Storer held that faith but wore his skepticism like a comfortable suit, for a 
number of good reasons. I’ve argued here that seeking rigorous empirical proof may be 
too much of a burden for the data to bear. By taking a broader lens to international 
business activity, what we see is highly suggestive that trade liberalization has increased 
integration within the NAFTA economies—and this constitutes sufficient evidence for 
policy-makers to take the issue seriously. 
 
 18 
 We conjecture that rising integration will appear in parameter bias or even structural 
misspecification in workhorse forecasting and policy models, posing a real issue for 
central bankers. Ultimately, policy models can be revised to capture these evolutions in 
behaviour, subject to the caveat that the degree of integration need not be constant 
through time. The Bank of Canada’s model, ToTEM, is capable of capturing such shifts, in 
theory, but model respecifications need to be based on reliable empirical work, which is 
not extensive. For the present, it may have to suffice for policy-makers to acknowledge 
the risks posed by shifts in integration and consider how to insulate policy decisions 
from those risks. 
 
Our model simulations suggest that models that do not recognize rising integration are 
likely to predict that monetary policy actions will be more effective at stabilizing the 
economy and controlling inflation than they will prove to be in practice. In other words, 
a central bank that relies on a model that does not take rising trade integration into 
account when it should do so will tend to react too gradually and perhaps insufficiently 
to external shocks. This would run the risk of inflation deviating from target for longer 
than desired. 
 
On the other side of this risk is a modicum of comfort—by all counts, it would appear 
that trade integration is not headed for infinity. Rather, the optimal level of cross-border 
integration is a complex decision by individual companies that depends on logistics, 
transportation costs, geopolitical risk and evolving cost structures in foreign economies. 
As such, we have every reason to believe that the bias that globalization may be 
introducing into our models evolves gradually, probably in both directions, and has 
natural limits. Nevertheless, policy-makers need to acknowledge that international 
developments will have an influence on their economies and on the volatility of their 
financial markets.
