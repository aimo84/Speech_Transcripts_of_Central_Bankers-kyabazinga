  Raghuram Rajan: Strengthening free enterprise in India 
Notes for the 13th Nani A Palkhivala Memorial Lecture by Dr Raghuram Rajan, Governor of 
the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai, 4 February 2016. 
 I did not have the privilege of meeting Nani Palkhivala, but every citizen of India has been 
affected  in  some  way  by  his  life’s  work,  and  owes  him  a  debt  of  gratitude.  Born  in  1920, 
Mr. Palkhivala was not only a jurist of the highest caliber, he was also a tireless champion of 
constitutional  liberties,  of  human  rights  and  individual  freedom,  and  of  economic  freedom. 
Nani Palkhivala fought the Kesavananda Bharati case that established the principle that the 
Indian Parliament cannot alter the basic structure of the constitution. This, by itself, would be 
enough to enshrine him as a founder of modern India. But he did much more. He stood up to 
the  Emergency,  one  of  the  few  voices  raised  against  authoritarianism,  when  the  very 
character of India’s democracy was in question. And recognizing that political and economic 
freedom go hand in hand, in his regular post budget speech, he enthralled thousands with 
his views on the economic policies of the country. 
Mr. Palkhivala was a lonely voice against the socialism practiced in India then, arguing that it 
was  a  fraud  –  transferring  wealth  from  the  honest  rich  to  the  dishonest  rich.  Instead,  he 
championed free enterprise. It bears remembering that he was chairman of TCS, one of the 
brightest stars of the Indian economy today. No wonder Rajaji once called him “God’s own 
gift to India”. 
Towards the end of his life, Nani Palkhivala soured on the Indian experience. In a speech in 
Australia, dejected by the leak of the IIT entrance exam papers, reflecting the weakening of 
yet another once-sacrosanct institution, he said, “I do not think India, in its entire history of 
5000 years, has ever reached a lower level of degradation than it has reached now.” But in 
that  speech,  he  also  said  that  India  always  seemed  to  find  a  way  of  coming  out  of  the 
morass. I will argue in my talk today that Palkhivala’s optimism about India eventually finding 
the way was probably more warranted than his pessimism. Yes, we have our weaknesses 
and  our  excesses,  but  our  democracy  is  self-correcting,  and  even  while  some  institutions 
weaken,  others  come  to  the  fore.  India’s  is  a  dynamic  society,  ever  changing,  ever 
rejuvenating.  Indeed,  the  possibilities  for  free  enterprise  in  India  today  are  probably  better 
than ever before in its history. 
Conditions for free enterprise to flourish have historically thought to be two: 
1. 
2. 
Let me first discuss these conditions, then I will add two more that I think important for free 
enterprise to be politically viable. 
3. 
4. 
Level playing field with easy entry and exit, and 
Protection of property rights. 
Broadening access to capabilities, and 
A basic safety net. 
a) 
• 
 Level playing field with easy entry and exit. 
Competition leads to efficient outcomes when anyone can enter, set up a firm, and 
compete. The best entity wins leading to economy wide efficiency. 
Free enterprise and competition combats prejudice and social biases.

 Government  and  regulators  are  needed  to  set  the  rules  of  the  game  and  enforce 
behavior.  Biased  government/regulation  distorts  the  playing  field.  Not  that  there 
should be no handicaps but not unequal handicaps. 
o  Work I did on entry regulation: Italian firms small. But low entry. Why? Work I 
did  Rajan,  Laeven  and  Klapper  (2006).  Italian  firms  need  greater  size  to 
overcome fixed costs of entry but grow more slowly. Slower economic growth.

License-Permit Raj: Remedy: Liberalization of the 1990s. 
 
Resources Raj: Privileged access to mines, spectrum, etc. Remedy: Auctions 
and transparency. 
Inspector Raj: Remedy: Start up India, reducing red tape, entry barriers. 
 
Continuing clean-up of laws gives hope, especially as states compete for 
simplifying regulations. 
RBI master directions. 
 Some continuing infirmities that especially hurt new firms: 
o 
Roads, ports, airports, power, internet marketplaces 
Infrastructure plus logistics: Weighted against the small. 
 
Land: Weighted against the new. 
 
Competition between states 
Finance:  Weighted  against  new  and  untried.  Changing  with  technology  and 
new institutions.

Protection of property rights

Broadly protected in India 
Is it too well protected – land for infrastructure 
Private property protection needed to incentivize activity: I eat what I kill.

Moderate  and  predictable  taxes  and  estate  duties  –  Government  has 
delivered. 
 
 
Retrospective  taxation:  Clear  government  statement.  However,  base  erosion 
and profit shifting – worldwide issue that large corporations need to answer – 
equal  requirement  of  transparency  on  corporate  side:  Need  for  global 
agreements. 
Administrative steps to rein in unnecessary tax demands 
Automation of significant parts of the tax process 
Broadening access to capabilities

Aam aadmi attaches no value to free enterprise if he cannot participate. 
Increasingly,  enterprises  of  the  future  require  employees  to  have  decent 
education and health. 
Malnutrition curses an individual for life, as does poor early education. 
Effective  delivery  of  social  programs  so  that  everyone  has  the  ability  to 
compete is absolutely necessary. 
Capitalism starts at age 21! 
o

o 
A basic safety net 
o 
Competition can be ruinous despite one’s best efforts.

o 
 Unemployment insurance, basic healthcare, old age pensions 
Need a basic safety net, not focused on firms but on individuals: 
 
Should not be prohibitively costly for government. 
 
 
 
Cost entitlements and incorporate into budget liability projections 
Charge reasonable premiums for the insurance 
Recognize  that  if  insurance  is  not  explicit,  it  will  be  implicit  in  a 
democratic society. 
o 
Safety net can also encourage people to take risks they would shy away from 
otherwise. 
In conclusion 
o

o 
o 
India has come a long way in encouraging free enterprise. 
From  tiny  shops  to  large  internet  start-ups,  the  spirit  of  entrepreneurship  is 
alive. 
Graduates  increasingly  want  to  start  businesses  or  work  for  start-ups  rather 
than go to an established consultancy or bank. 
Doing business is more reputable, as is getting rich. 
But a lot more work is needed to improve the environment so that everyone 
has a chance. Rather than looking for special dispensations, business has to 
push  for  improving  the  business  environment  for  everyone.  Glad  business 
associations are increasingly doing this. 
As Palkhivala said, India always seems to find the way, perhaps not quickly 
and not linearly, but in due course.
