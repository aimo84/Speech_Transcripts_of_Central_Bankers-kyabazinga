REMARKS ON THE CHILEAN ECONOMY 
 Mario Marcel1/ 
Governor, Central Bank of Chile 
April 2017 
 
 
 
1.  The last few months have brought mixed signals for the Chilean economy. Recent data 
suggest the  global outlook appears more favorable, particularly  for emerging  economies. 
On the one hand,  activity  data  and expectations  in advanced economies  have been more 
upbeat,  marked  by  better  than  expected  performance  by  the  manufacturing  sector  and  a 
more  positive  outlook  following  years  of  stagnation.  As  a  result,  deflationary  risks  have 
dissipated, as inflation is expected to return to  more normal levels. The Federal Reserve 
(Fed) has continued to normalize monetary policy and monetary authorities in Europe and 
Japan appear to have set aside the possibility of additional stimulus measures. Markets have 
incorporated  these  changes  in  their  expectations  avoiding  any  serious  disruptions.  Along 
with better signs in advanced economies, activity in China has remained relatively stable, 
which contrasts with what had been observed one year ago.  
 
2.  In this context, there has been a generalized increase in willingness to take on risk in 
financial markets, increasing stock market indices, reducing sovereign risk premiums and 
increasing  capital  flows  to  emerging  markets.  Commodity  prices  have  also  benefitted. 
Copper,  our  main  export  product,  has  been  trading  at  prices  near  its  two  year  highs  and 
prospects for the next few years have improved, which has had a material impact on the 
Chilean  terms  of  trade.  Thus,  based  on  better  growth  prospects  for  our  trading  partners, 
favorable external financial conditions and increased terms of trade, the baseline scenario 
included in our Monetary Policy Report published the first days of this month, considered 
that, for the next two years, the Chilean economy will receive an external impulse higher 
than considered at the end of 2016, when our previous report was published (figure 1).

3.  On  the  domestic  front,  inflation  has  been  consistent  with  what  was  expected  in 
December. The annual variation of the CPI index fell to 2.7% in March, a significant drop 
compared  to  the  4.5%  figure  of  a  year  ago.  The  behavior  of  the  nominal  exchange  rate, 
which has appreciated relative to its level one year ago, has been a fundamental driver of 
inflationary dynamics. The appreciation has had a greater impact in the decline of the goods 
component of the CPIEFE index (our core inflation measure). In fact, the goods component 
of core inflation dropped from nearly 5% at the beginning of 2016 to 0.3% in March. The 
services component has been stickier, and has dropped from the same levels the first few 
month of last year to 3.3% in March. An explanation for this is that approximately ¾ of the 
prices included in this component are administered prices or are indexed to past inflation, a 
fact  that  enhances  their  inertia  and,  as  such,  makes  them  less  sensitive  to  exchange  rate 
fluctuations (figure 2).

4.  Although in our baseline scenario headline inflation is expected to continue declining in 
the coming months, reaching levels in the lower bound of our tolerance range, it is foreseen 
to return to 3% by the end of 2017 and fluctuate close to our target towards the end of the 
forecast  horizon  in  the  first  quarter  of  2019.  Market  expectations  are  very  similar  to  the 
forecasts included in our latest Report, and also point to CPI inflation fluctuating around 
our  3%  target  starting  the  end  of  this  year.  Convergence  of  inflation  rests  on  two  main 
assumptions. The first one, that our RER will remain relatively stable at its current levels; a 
level we believe is consistent with fundamentals. And the second one, that the output gap 
will gradually close by the end of this year (figure 3).

 5.  Actually, activity has been worse than expected. According to recent data the output gap 
is currently somewhat larger than we anticipated in December. GDP grew by 1.6% in 2016, 
in line with what was anticipated then. However, revised national account data —including 
the  publication  of  the  new  Benchmark  Compilation,  with  base  year  2013—  suggest  the 
economy was somewhat stronger towards the beginning of 2016 and weaker towards the 
end of the year, leaving a low starting point for 2017 and a higher base of comparison for 
the beginning of the year. The new data also point to weakness in investment-related areas 
and in sectors that tend to be more persistent, such as business services (figure 4).

 6.  On  the  expenditure  side,  domestic  demand—excluding  changes  in  inventories—also 
tended  to  decelerate  throughout  last  year.  Weakness  was  most  evident  in  investment  in 
construction and other works, which contracted by 4.9% in annual terms during the fourth 
quarter (average growth of 0.5% between the first and third quarters).  
 7.  Private  consumption,  in  line  with  its  behavior  in  the  previous  years,  supported  the 
economy, growing by more than 2% annually throughout 2016. Private consumption has 
been enhanced by wage growth and a low unemployment rate. However, it must be noted 
that while consumption of non-durables and services has remained relatively stable, durable 
goods consumption has recovered, partly due to the appreciation of the peso during the last 
year,  and  the  necessary  replenishment  of  inventories  following  several  years  of  weak 
growth  and  even  contraction.  Something  similar  is  observed  with  gross  fixed  capital 
formation  in  machinery  and  equipment.  Excluding  the  purchase  of  non-regular  transport 
machinery, this component of investment has improved in recent months. 
 
8.  In our baseline scenario, gross fixed capital formation will experience a slightly positive 
growth in 2017, after three consecutive years of contraction. A key factor in the negative 
figures we have seen the last few years is the end of the mining investment cycle, which 
reached  its  peak  in  2012.  More  recently  the  deterioration  of  housing  construction  has 
added, as the boom triggered by tax incentives finished and a modification of loan-to-value 
norms reduced home sales. Going forward, our forecasts rely on an increase in non-mining 
and  non-residential  investment  (mainly  machinery  and  equipment).  While  mining 
investment will eventually return to positive territory during 2018, the gradual adjustment 
in residential investment is expected to continue during the following quarters (figure 5).

9.  The  labor  market  continues  to  gradually  adjust  and  could  become  a  drag  on 
consumption. Wage employment declined by 2% annually in the moving quarter that ended 
in February, and annual wage growth moderated. In addition, the number of hours worked 
declined,  at  a  time  when  an  increasing  number  of  workers  suggest  their  workdays  are 
shorter  than  desired.  In  any  case,  this  has  not  translated  into  an  increase  in  open 
unemployment, due to flexibility in the Chilean labor market: the unemployment rate is still 
low from an historic perspective. In fact, despite being more precarious, self-employment 
has acted as a significant buffer to the loss of dynamism in wage employment (figure 6).

10.  Domestic financial conditions remain favorable, particularly in terms of interest rates. 
Notwithstanding, credit volumes have decelerated with respect to previous years, as a result 
of  overall  subdued  demand.  Despite  some  increase  in  recent  data,  arrears  ratios  are  still 
low, a clear sign that slower growth has not affected the financial health of companies and 
households.  
 
11.  The evolution of the local stock market has caught some attention lately, since the 
IPSA  has  increased  about  17%  this  year  and  more  than  30%  since  December  2015. 
Although these numbers might ring some bells, the performance of the Chilean index does 
not differ significantly from other regional stock markets and its recent behavior might just 
be a catch up from very low levels. Measured in real terms, its current value does not seem 
to be an outlier either (figure 7).

12.  The  prolonged  strike  at  the  Escondida,  the  open-pit  copper  mine  with  the  world’s 
largest production, will  have a very important  effect on our first quarter GDP figures.  It 
already did in the Imacec of February, which showed a yoy contraction of 1.3%, with a fall 
of  17.1%  of  its  mining  component.  Since  the  strike  ended  in  late  March  and  resuming 
normal  production  levels  is  not  instantaneously,  the  figures  of  that  month  will  also  be 
affected. If you add the continued weakness in construction, the economy could experience 
an expansion close to 0% in the first quarter of the year. However, one should not forget 
that the strike at Escondida, while very relevant to explain the first quarter figure, is a one-
off event that is not expected to generate significant spillovers on activity elsewhere in the 
economy, nor on inflation.    
  13.  For  these  reasons  we  reduced  our  growth  forecast  for  2017,  and  we  are  now 
projecting GDP will be in the 1-2% range (1.5-2.5% in December). At the same time, for 
2018 we are expecting the economy to grow between 2.25 and 3.25% (table 1). The growth 
recovery  is  based  on  the  fact  that  the  economy  does  not  appear  to  have  any  relevant 
imbalances,  the  mining-related  investment  adjustment  is  expected  to  end,  and  as  I 
mentioned at the beginning of my presentation, the global outlook appears more favorable. 
Fiscal  policy  is  assumed  to  follow  the  fiscal  consolidation  path  announced  by  the 
Government.

14.  Or  growth  scenario  also  assumes  that  monetary  policy  will  remain  expansionary 
throughout  the  policy  horizon.  Following  our  communication  in  December,  when  we 
signaled that an  additional impulse was necessary  for inflation to converge to the target, 
during the first months of the year, we reduced the monetary policy rate (MPR) by 50 basis 
points  (bp),  leaving  it  at  3%.  These  actions  meant  anticipating  our  December 
announcement.  Later,  in  our  March  Report,  we  announced  the  need  of  a  slightly  greater 
monetary policy impulse. As a result, we used the working assumption that the MPR would 
follow a trajectory similar to the one implied by financial asset prices during the ten days 
prior to its statistical closing. In practice, this meant at least one additional 25bp cut. It is 
always worth remembering that this is a working assumption and as such, contingent to the 
new developments and their impact on projected inflation. If incoming information points 
at the necessity of an additional boost or, on the contrary, if this is no longer needed, we 
will  react  promptly,  communicating  the  justification  of  doing  so.  Consistent  with  the 
assumption used in our March Report, in April we decided to lower the MPR by 25bp, to 
2.75%. The press release issued then stated that we will assess the need for some additional 
increase in the monetary impulse, which will hinge on the medium-term inflation outlook 
(figure 8). This way, our monetary policy continues to be one of the most expansionary in a 
group of comparable economies.

 15.  As usual when making forecasts, our macroeconomic scenario faces several risks. If 
they materialize, they may  reshape the macroeconomic outlook and, therefore, may  alter 
the course of monetary policy. We have identified two types of risks in the external front 
facing the Chilean economy. Some of them may potentially have a material impact, yet are 
hard to quantify (such as political-economic uncertainty). Others risks have been mentioned 
for  quite  some  time,  but  their  likelihood  have  varied.  Regarding  the  latter,  the  expected 
trajectories  of  fiscal  and  monetary  policy  in  the  U.S.  may  potentially  generate  upside  or 
downside risks. China remains a source of concern although its authorities appear to have 
successfully managed a gradual deceleration without a major disruption thus far. These are 
probably risks for most economies of the world, but particularly for a small open economy, 
such as Chile. 
 16. On the domestic front, after several years of subdued growth, we cannot rule out that a 
more persistent phenomenon may be affecting the economy’s ability to grow, in which case 
it would be necessary to revise the public and private expenditure plans. Moreover, while 
the  labor  market  has  gradually  adjusted  without  generating  a  significant  increase  in 
unemployment,  it  is  possible  that  after  several  years  of  low  growth,  firms  require  larger 
personnel adjustments, especially if the expected growth recovery towards the end of the 
year  stalls.  In  contrast,  in  the  context  of  the  absence  of  observable  macroeconomic 
imbalances that hinder growth, a scenario in which the global outlook improves, combined 
with the end of the adjustment of mining-related investment, and a rebound in sentiment, 
may lead to a more dynamic recovery (figure 9).  
 17. In fact, several fundamentals of the Chilean economy have remained quite solid during 
this weaker part of the cycle. As you might know, Chile was one of the first few countries 
to introduce a structural fiscal policy, which has been applied consistently over more than 
15 years. As part of this policy, the government has been able to save during good times 
and currently has two sovereign wealth funds, totaling almost 10% of GDP.

 18.  Strength of our country is the fact that compared to earlier low-growth periods it has 
more liquid external funds available. At the same time, the financial sector is healthy and 
non-performing  loans  have  diminished  over  time.  Reforms  currently  under  discussion, 
particularly a New General Banking Law, aim to bolster resilience and improve banking 
capital adequacy ratios (figure 10).

The medium- and long-term outlook  
 
19.  The Chilean economy has endured a long period of slow growth, while its potential 
growth has dropped to a range between 2.5% and 3%, i.e., less than estimated a decade ago 
(4%  to  5%).  In  principle,  this  change  is  explained  by:  (a)  a  smaller  contribution  of  the 
accumulation of productive factors, inherent to a maturing economy;  (b) a drop in  gross 
fixed capital formation that has lasted several years; (c) reduced mining productivity; and 
(d) a limited contribution of productivity growth in the other sectors. 
 
20.  The reduced potential growth calls for closer attention to the determinants of longer-
term growth. Although the incidence of monetary policy is mild, every central bank must 
be able to monitor the developments affecting the future path of the economy to ensure a 
more effective monetary policy.  
 
21.  Among  Chile’s  future  growth  possibilities  is  the  fact  that  closing  the  output  gap 
would allow boosting growth in a stable manner from just less than 2% in recent years to a 
2.5% to 3% range. As I mentioned before, this is grounded on a better external scenario, the 
fading  of  some  sectoral  factors  that  have  slowed  down  the  pace  of  growth,  a  more 
expansionary  monetary  policy,  and  the  lack  of  macroeconomic  growth  constraints.  This 
requires more dynamic exports, domestic demand and investment. 
 
22.  A more significant increase in investment that brings it closer to its historical rates, 
coupled by increased factor mobility, would boost growth to a sustainable rate of around 
3.5%. This would require revitalizing mining investment, better investor expectations in the 
rest of the economy, favorable financial conditions, and the elimination of bottlenecks that 
hinder the reallocation of resources toward more competitive areas. A smooth operation of 
both the labor market and the capital market is essential for this. 
 
23.  Regarding  productivity  growth  in  the  other  sectors,  the  possibility  of  further 
improvements  relies  mainly  on:  (1)  increasing  human  capital  accumulation  through 
increased labor participation, raising working skills above the already projected levels or 
the  migration  of  workers  with  the  competences  required  by  the  Chilean  system;  and  (2) 
making  productivity  improvements  via  enhancing  companies’  efficiency,  lowering 
production and trading costs, and changing output composition toward more competitive 
and  productive  sectors,  while  advancing  in  terms  of  innovation  and  technological 
development. 
 
24.  As Chile’s concern for growth has intensified, many ideas about public policies have 
emerged  that  could  help  enhance  productivity,  with  proposals  coming  from  the 
government,  private  agents  and  the  National  Productivity  Commission.  In  particular, 
policies have been developed that have permitted to diversify the energy matrix, increase 
supply reliability and reduce costs. There have been other factors, however, that pose a risk 
to  productivity,  including  initiatives  that  may  overburden  corporate  costs,  generate  new 
trading costs or reduce savings. 
 
25.  Finally,  any  discussion  about  productivity  must  necessarily  cover  technological 
development. This is a key driver of economies’ productivity and competitiveness around 
the world. It is obvious in my opinion that the new technologies, knowledge and innovation 
capacity  are  input  into  the  productive  system  through  new  ventures,  investments  and 
restructurings.
