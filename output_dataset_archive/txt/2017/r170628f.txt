Brexit: the possible economic and financial effects 
Testimony of Luigi Federico Signorini, 
Deputy Governor of the Bank of Italy 
Chamber of Deputies 
Rome, 26 April 2017 
        Mr Chairman, Honourable Members of Parliament, 
I would like to thank the Committees for inviting the Bank of Italy to comment on the United 
Kingdom’s exit from the European Union. I will begin with a brief description of some well-known 
institutional  aspects  and  then  make  some  comments  on  the  possible  economic  (for  the  United 
Kingdom, Europe and Italy) and financial repercussions. At this point in time, my observations can 
only be preliminary ones. 
Institutional aspects: negotiations, exit and future relationships 
Following the agreements reached in Lisbon in 2007, an article was added to the Treaty on 
the  European  Union  –  the  constitutional  basis  of  the  EU  –  which    explicitly  provides  for  the 
possibility that a member state might wish to withdraw, and regulates the relative procedure. This is 
Article 50, now well-known after being invoked for the first time by the UK on 29 March in Prime 
Minister May’s letter to the President of the European Council. 
Article  50  envisages four phases.  The first one,  already completed,  requires the outgoing 
member  state  to  notify  the  European  Council  of  its  intention  to  withdraw  from  the  European 
Union.  The  other  steps  are  as  follows:  the  Commission  is  given  a  mandate  to  negotiate  the 
withdrawal  agreement  according  to  the  guidelines  unanimously  established  by  the  Council;  the 
Commission  conducts  the  negotiations  on  the  withdrawal  agreement;  and  both  parties  approve 
the agreement. The United Kingdom will not participate in the Council’s decisions; aside from that, 
it will retain meanwhile all the rights and obligations arising from its EU membership. 
Given  the  geographical  proximity,  the  long,  shared  history  and  the  deep-seated  economic 
integration of the UK with the rest of Europe, there is a great deal of discussion on both sides as to 
how  the  withdrawal  will  take  place  and  what  relations  will  be  established  afterwards,  with 
comparisons made between hard and soft Brexits, concepts that have yet to be clearly defined. 
In principle there are two separate but related negotiations. One concerns the exit agreement as 
such,  to  which  the procedure of Article  50 refers.  It  should  cover  issues  such  as  the  position of 
people and firms that live and work in the EU, thanks to the current freedom of movement, but 
will  find  themselves  on  the  other  side  of  what  will  again  become  an  international  border  in  all 
respects  in  2019:  this applies to  British  citizens  in  Europe  and to European ones in  the  UK.  This 
agreement   might   establish   transitional   rules   and   temporary   or   permanent,   conditional   or 
unconditional, recognition of status, on people’s right to stay where they are and continue with their 
current  activities.  Another  important  issue,  which  will  presumably  be  covered  by the  withdrawal 
agreement, is the UK’s financial obligations towards the EU as a member state. 
The other negotiation concerns relations between the two parties after the withdrawal, including 
any  trade  agreements.  Although  the  two  negotiations  are  linked  conceptually  and  certainly 
politically, they could in theory have different outcomes. For example, an agreement may be reached 
on the exit but not on subsequent relationships; in any case, the agreement on the new relationships 
will only be formally stipulated at a later date. 
It is also not inconceivable that the negotiations are a complete failure, which would lead to 
the hardest of hard Brexits (except in the case of an extension of the two-year deadline, which the 
Treaty allows if decided unanimously). Both sides have indicated their wish to avoid a traumatic 
conclusion and to reach an agreement,  as called for in a recent speech by Barnier, the European 
Commission’s chief negotiator; it is to be hoped that they hold to this intention so as not to cause 
serious and avoidable personal and economic problems. 
As far as post-Brexit trade relations  between the UK and the EU are concerned,  in theory 
there are four possibilities. 
1.  Accession to the European Economic Area (EEA) to which Iceland,  Liechtenstein and Norway 
belong, as well as EU member states. Membership of the EEA ensures full participation in the 
European Single Market for non-EU states and entails accepting the ‘four freedoms’ (the free 
movement of people, goods, services and capital),  with the same rights and obligations as EU 
member states,  including a financial contribution. However, though non-EU states must apply 
the rules for participating in the single market, they do not decide them within EU institutions, 
such as the Commission, the Parliament and the Council.1
 
2.  Participation in  a customs  union  with  the European Union,  as in the  case of  Turkey.  This  union 
provides  for  the  free  movement  of  goods,  the  obligation  to  implement  the  relevant  European 
regulations  and  a  waiver  on  deciding  own  customs  duties  and  on  the  possibility  of  reaching 
independent trade agreements. 
3.  A free trade agreement.2
 1  Switzerland, which is a member state of the European Free Trade Association  (EFTA),  as are  Iceland,  Liechtenstein 
and Norway,  is not a member of the EEA,  but over time it has stipulated over one hundred  bilateral agreements with 
the  European  Union  (including  the  free  movement  of  goods  and  people,  but  not  of  services  and  capital)  and  is 
required to implement the relative European regulations. 
2  Depending on the scope of the agreement, ratification by all EU member states could be required. 
4 
       4.  If no agreement were reached, trade relations would be governed by World Trade Organization 
regulations. In this case, the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clause would apply, which prohibits 
any  form  of  discrimination:  each  state  undertakes  to  extend  to  every  other  state  the  same 
treatment granted to all countries with which there are no specific bilateral trade agreements. 
In practice, however, neither membership of the EEA nor of a customs union seem realistic 
options.  The former would impose the free movement of people and the obligation to implement the 
‘acquis  communautaire’,  both of which the UK wants to abolish;  the latter, as well as laying down 
certain regulatory restrictions, would greatly curb the UK’s freedom to decide independently on its 
trade  relations  with  other  countries.  The  UK  government’s  notification  of  withdrawal  makes  a 
general reference to a ‘deep and special partnership’ with the EU, but effectively appears to exclude 
staying in the single market. 
The most likely scenario – if there is no change of heart – is that the UK will become a real 
‘third country’ for the EU. Under this hypothesis, the question is whether it is possible to reach at 
least  a  free  trade  agreement,  which  would  benefit  the  common  interest;  the  notification  letter 
expresses a desire for it to be ‘bold and ambitious’. At this stage, the nature, timeframe and contents 
of any future agreement cannot be predicted. Negotiations are yet to begin; the UK government’s 
stance will also depend on the outcome of the recently announced general election. We may imagine 
that the main topics of negotiation will be the trade of goods and, above all, financial services. 
There  are  free  trade  agreements  with  nearly  one  hundred  advanced  and  emerging  countries, 
including  Switzerland,  Canada  and  South  Korea.  The  agreement  recently  concluded  with  Canada  is 
particularly interesting since, as well as eliminating customs duties, it makes access to public tenders and 
investments easier and facilitates trade in services. 
If, or for as long as, there is no agreement, the trade relations between the EU and the UK 
will  be  governed  by  WTO  regulations,  unless  there  are  specific  transitional  agreements,  and  the 
MFN clause will be applied. 
5 
     The economic impact 
United Kingdom – In the short term, the negative effects on the UK’s economy that many 
expected immediately after the referendum failed to materialize. GDP growth actually increased in 
the  second  half  of  2016,  rising  from  1.6  to  2.4  per  cent  on  an  annual  basis,  and  employment 
continued to  rise.  Much depended on the strongly expansionary measures introduced  by the Bank 
of England in August and on a more accommodative fiscal policy stance. 
On  3  August  2016  the  Bank  of  England  cut  its  Bank  Rate  by  25  basis  points;  resumed  the 
purchase  of  UK  government  bonds;  and  launched  new  schemes  for  corporate  bond  purchase  and  for 
extending loans to commercial banks. The HM Treasury put a brake on the fiscal consolidation process. 
Analysts  have  progressively  revised  growth  forecasts  upwards  for  2017,  but  continue  to 
expect a slowdown over the year. According to the most recent consensus estimates,  growth in the 
UK’s GDP is expected to average 1.7 per cent over the year,  slightly below that of 2016. 
The  most  significant  effects  of  the  referendum  have  been  on  the  sterling  exchange  rate, 
which  has  depreciated by  about 10  per  cent  since  23  June,  both  against the euro  and in  nominal 
effective terms (that is, against all the other main currencies, weighted according to their trade with 
the UK); inflation rose by nearly 2 percentage points, to 2.3 per cent in March. The severe tensions 
besetting  international  financial  markets  around  the  time  of  the  referendum  dissipated  quickly 
(Table 1). The economic policy uncertainty index rose in late June and early July, but then returned 
to pre-referendum levels (Figure 1). 
It cannot be ruled out that any tensions arising from negotiations with the EU may trigger 
new bouts of financial volatility over the next few years, especially if they coincide with renewed 
concerns on the markets as to the cohesion of the Union. 
What may happen in the long term remains uncertain.  Openness to trade, immigration, and 
foreign investment generally promote  growth, while a decrease in these factors, especially if it occurs 
in a climate of increasing protectionism  at  global  level, could create significant costs  for the UK 
economy  in  terms  of  innovative  capacity,  competitiveness,  and  productivity  growth.  This  would 
also  occur  in  the  EU  market, though  on  a  more  limited  scale  and  would  vary  from  country  to 
country,  depending  on  their  links  with  the  UK.  The  UK  market  is  quite  a  small  one  for  the EU, 
accounting for 7.1  per  cent  of total exports;  in contrast,  the EU is the destination for 44 per cent of 
UK goods. 
According  to  our  studies,  if  the  UK  and  the  EU  imposed  reciprocal  trade  tariffs,  the  long-term 
economic cost to the British economy would be significant, particularly if productivity growth diminished at 
the same time; the repercussions for the euro area would instead be small. 
6 
        Brexit is expected to have an impact on the EU’s budget, to which the UK makes a positive 
contribution. From 2010 to 2015, even taking into account the rebate negotiated by Margaret Thatcher in 
1984 and the rebate received by the UK for its partial participation in justice and home affairs policies, the 
country contributed over €13 billion a year on average while receiving less than €7 billion. Moreover, the 
EU will no longer receive the customs duty collected in the UK; instead it will collect the duty levied on 
British exports to the EU. The overall effect is still difficult to assess. 
Discussions are still under way about the UK’s financial obligations to the EU when it leaves 
(the Brexit bill). Calculating the amount is a complex and controversial matter. One question is 
how  the  UK’s  share  of  the  EU  total  should  be  calculated  (it  amounts  to  about  15  per  cent  of 
gross  national  income but  12  per cent in terms  of  contribution to  the budget  after  rebates)  and 
what asset and liability items should be included. This will probably be  one of the most delicate 
issues faced during the exit negotiations. 
Italy  –  Unfavourable economic developments in the UK would in any case not have any 
major repercussions for Italy in the short term. The slowdown that the Bank of England has forecast 
for 2018-20  would have a negligible impact.  Even if the UK experienced such a deep recession as 
to reduce imports by 10 per cent over a three-year period, we estimate that the effect on Italy’s GDP 
would be at most 0.25 percentage points.3  Italy’s trade and financial ties with the UK are not as 
close as those of other major euro-area countries (Table 2). 
In 2015 Italian exports to the UK amounted to 1.8 per cent of GDP, against 2.7 for France, 3.2 for 
Spain  and  3.7  for  Germany.  Imports  amounted  to  1.1  per  cent  of  GDP,  again  less  than  for  the  other 
countries.  Italy  mainly  exports  machinery  and  mechanical  engineering  products,  agri-food  products, 
transport  equipment,  clothing  and  footwear,  and  tourism  services.  The  bilateral  balance  on  goods  is 
very positive for Italy, while the balance on services is generally even. 
Italy’s  financial  ties  with  the  UK  are  not  as  close  as  those  of  the  other  main  European 
countries, as regards both portfolio investment and direct investment. 
In  June  2016,  Italian  residents’  portfolios  included  €60.8  billion  worth  of  UK-issued  securities 
(that  is,  3.7  per  cent  of  GDP,  compared  with  France’s  10.1  and  Germany’s  5.9).  Italian  investors  have 
limited exposure to exchange rate risk between the euro and sterling, with securities denominated in sterling 
accounting for little more than 1.1 per cent of the total. At the end of 2015 Italian direct investment in the 
UK stood at 1.4 per cent of GDP, compared with significantly higher percentages for the other leading euro- 
area countries. UK investment in Italy amounted to 2.2 per cent of Italian GDP. 
If negotiations for a free trade deal between the EU and the UK are unsuccessful, trade 
between  the  two  will  become  subject  to  customs  duties.  To  have  an  idea  of  the    potential 
economic impact for both sides let us assume that the UK applies the current EU tariffs at least 
until it has put its own tariff system in place; in  other  words,  the  trade  tariffs  that  the EU 
3  Economic Bulletin 3/2016.

         currently  applies  outside  the  area  will  apply  between  the  area  and  the  UK. On  this  basis,  and 
considering only the impact effect (i.e. excluding any reallocation of trade flows), customs duty 
on goods exported by the 27-member EU to the UK would total about €16 billion and the duty on 
British goods exported to the EU-27 over €6 billion. Customs duty would on average represent a 
higher proportion of the value of goods (5.2 per cent) for exports from the EU-27 to the UK than 
the other way round (3.9 per cent) because of the different sectoral composition. 
In fact, tariffs differ considerably across goods categories. Close to one fifth of the value of EU- 
27 exports to the UK relates to motor vehicles, which carry very high duty. 
Moreover, as the structure of exports differs across EU-27 member countries, the average 
incidence of the tariff applied to exports to the UK would also differ. In the case of Germany, the 
tariff  would  be  similar  to  the  EU-27  average;  for  France  and  Italy  it  would  be  slightly  less; 
Ireland, Spain and Poland would be faced with average duties in excess of 6 per cent. 
If the existing European tariffs were applied to Italy’s exports to the UK, in the case of machinery 
and mechanical engineering products, a sector that accounts for 20 per cent of Italian exports to the UK, the 
effect would be small (about 2 per cent of the value). The difference would be greater in the case of agri-food 
products  (almost  10  per  cent),  clothing  and  footwear  (8.2  per  cent),  and  above  all  motor  vehicles,  even 
though  the  sector  accounts  for  a  much  smaller  share  of  exports  to  the  UK  (12  per  cent)  than  in  other 
countries (Germany 33 per cent, Spain 32 and Belgium 26). 
Even  with a  free  trade  agreement, the  UK would  have to pay the  administrative  costs associated 
with the ‘rules of origin’, i.e. certification that goods being exported to the EU-27 (and many of the inputs 
needed  to  manufacture  them)  do  not  come  from  countries  subject  to  EU  customs  duty.  Differences  in 
regulations and other non-tariff measures could further increase the cost of trade. 
8 
     Financial regulation, banks and market infrastructure 
Financial  regulation  –  One  of  the  biggest  unknowns  of  Brexit  is  what  shape  future 
financial relations will take, starting with the regulatory aspect. 
As an EU member state, the UK is part of the single market in financial services in which 
the single passport applies. Thus, a bank authorized in one member state can operate in any other 
member state (by establishing branches or through the free provision of services) under a system 
of notification and without the need for authorization. Prudential controls are conducted by the 
authorities of the home member state; the host state is responsible for anti-money-laundering and 
consumer protection. 
With Brexit the single passport will be withdrawn. British banks will be treated like third- 
country  banks:  they  will  need  to  obtain  a  licence  in  all  the  member  states  where  they  wish  to 
operate and will become subject to supervision by their host country. 
UK-based  banks  and  economic  policymakers  and  financial  regulators  view  the 
possibility of losing the single passport with trepidation, fearing that the City will lose part of 
its  role  as  a  financial  centre  for  Europe  and  the  world.  At  present,  many  non-EU  banks 
(especially American and Asian ones) have their European legal and operational headquarters in the 
City, thus gaining access to the European financial market as well as to plentiful professional expertise 
and specialist services. 
When it leaves the EU the UK’s supervisory framework will, by definition, be ‘equivalent’ 
because – partly in consideration of the commitments set out in Prime Minister May’s letter of 
notification  –  European  regulations  will  initially  be  incorporated  en  bloc  in  the  UK’s  internal 
regulations. Any changes made subsequently will have to be examined to ensure that equivalence 
is maintained. 
Supervisory  ‘equivalence’,  as  defined  in  the  EU’s  financial  legislation,  gives  some  benefits  to 
third  countries. Most  of  these  are  exemptions  from specific requirements, but  in  the  case  of  investment 
services  (MIFID/MIFIR2)  and  alternative  investment  funds  (AIFMD)  the  legislation  effectively  gives 
equivalent  third-country  financial  intermediaries  a  single  passport  of  sorts  in  all  EU  member  states, 
though only with respect to their professional clientele. Ensuring that domestic financial legislation stays 
aligned with that of Europe would make it easier for UK banks to set up a presence in countries, like Italy, 
that only grant authorization after verifying the standard of home country supervision. 
Under  a  proposal  of  the  European  Commission  included  in  the  Review  of  the  Capital 
Requirements Directive and Regulation, in the future, third-country banks that are of systemic importance 
in the area would have to set up an intermediate parent undertaking (IPU) in Europe. The IPU and its 
subsidiaries  in  the  EU  would  be  subject  to  consolidated  supervision  and  crisis  management  under 
European  rules.  Hence,  the  major  UK  banking  groups  –  many  of  which  are  spin-offs  of  international 
groups  –  would presumably be required to set up an IPU. 
9 
        The UK will certainly try to reach agreements with the EU-27 that allow it to keep some of the 
benefits that London banks enjoy in terms of access to the European market. It is impossible to predict 
what these agreements will be or how they will affect London’s competitive advantage. 
Brexit also means that the European Banking Authority (EBA) headquartered in London will 
have to find a new home. 
The decision, which will be taken in the coming months, is connected to an on-going debate on 
possible  changes  to  the  architecture  of  European  system  of  financial  supervision.  The  Commission  has 
launched a public consultation prior to introducing new legislation. The present model is a sectoral one: 
the EBA is responsible for the banking sector, the EIOPA (headquartered in Frankfurt) for the insurance 
and pension fund industry, and the ESMA (based in Paris) for securities and markets. One of the options 
considered  (with  some  variations)  would  reduce  the  number  of  authorities  to  two:  one  for  banks  and 
insurance and the other for markets and securities. 
The debate is further complicated by the fact that the competencies transferred to the European 
level differ across sectors and activities (for example, more competencies are transferred for regulation 
than  for  supervision,  except  in  the  case  of  the  banking  industry  where  the  application  of  the  Single 
Supervisory Mechanism to the euro area alone has created a further difficulty). 
Banks – As far as Italy’s banking system is concerned, the importance of UK-based banks 
is limited. The 16 banks with branches in Italy account for 0.6 per cent of lending to customers. 
The  majority of  them  (11  of  the  16)  belong  to  third-country  groups  that  have  established  their 
European headquarters in London. They only have a significant role in some specific segments 
(advisory on extraordinary financing and placements, syndicated loans, and guarantees) relating 
to large corporations. Some international banks may move part of their activities from London to 
another European country, via either new or existing subsidiaries. The effect on Italian banking 
will probably be minimal. 
Moreover,  there  are  about  80 UK  banks  operating  in  Italy  without  a  branch,  through  the  free 
provision of services. They could continue to do so, failing any specific agreements, only if they set up a 
subsidiary in an EU member state. The scope of their activity in Italy is also limited. 
There are very few Italian banks in the UK. The leading Italian banking groups jointly have six 
branches in London, mainly involved in trading and investment banking; they use the City to access the 
international wholesale funding market, though on a smaller scale than before the financial crisis.  If 
they decided to move the management of these activities after Brexit, the cost is unlikely to be 
very high. 
The Italian banks have limited exposure to UK residents: at the end of 2016 it was just under 
€34  billion  (1.3  per  cent  of  the  Italian  banking  system’s  total  exposure),  three  quarters  of  which 
consisting of loans to other banks and financial corporations. 
Market infrastructure – Since 2007 Borsa Italiana Group has been controlled by London 
Stock  Exchange   Group   (LSEG),  which  owns  two  important  financial  market  management 
10 
         companies  (MTS  and  EuroTLX),  the  Italian  central  counterparty  (Cassa  di  Compensazione  e 
Garanzia)  and  the  central  securities  depository  (Monte  Titoli).  In  March  of  this  year  the 
interbank  deposit  market  management  company  (e-MID)  also  came  under  the  control  of  an 
English group. 
LSEG  and  Deutsche  Börse  had already planned a merger in 2016.  The European Commission, 
however,  recently  announced  that  it  had  blocked  the  plan,  which  in  its  opinion  would  have  created  a 
virtual monopoly of the clearing market for fixed-income instruments: in fact the new group would have 
included the four central counterparties with the largest volume of business in this segment. Competition 
in clearing for equity derivatives would also have been significantly reduced. 
Even if they are controlled by a foreign  entity, the trading and post-trading management 
companies  remain  fully  responsible  for  all  operating  processes.  They  are  supervised  at  the 
domestic  level  by  the  Bank  of  Italy  and  Consob.  Indeed,  unlike  banks,  markets  and  market 
infrastructure are supervised at the solo level, rather than on a consolidated basis. 
Controlling  shareholders  can  be  located  outside  the  EU  provided  they  meet  the  requirements  of 
integrity and capital adequacy. 
When the UK leaves the EU, the Bank of Italy and Consob will need to have closer contacts with 
controlling shareholders. When some of the cooperation mechanisms envisaged by European legislation 
are  no  longer  in  place,  the  Italian  authorities  will  have  to  step  up  their efforts  in  the  sphere of  cross- 
border supervisory cooperation, as well as increase their bilateral cooperation with the UK supervisory 
authorities. 
At European level, Brexit raises a matter of some importance regarding the supervision of 
central  counterparties,  since  euro-denominated  financial  instruments,  especially  derivatives,  are 
mostly cleared by UK-based entities.4 We will need to make sure that supervision of UK central 
counterparties  does  not  fall  below  the  level  set  by  European  regulations  for  the  main  stability 
profiles: prudential supervision, currency of cleared contracts, and market control. 
ESMA  proposed  a  review  of  EMIR  to  strengthen  the  process  of  recognizing  the  third-country 
CCPs  and  provide  forms  of  direct  supervision  by  the  European  authorities.  In  the  weeks  to  come,  the 
Commission will publish its proposed review of EMIR; the prospect of the UK’s exit requires this aspect 
to be carefully considered as well. 
 Prime Minister May’s letter triggered for the first time the process by which a Member 
State  can  leave  the  Union.  Difficult  negotiations  will  now  begin,  although  they  will  not  be 
lengthy since the Treaty imposes strict time limits, given the technical complexity and political 
sensitivity of many of the issues. Both sides will require foresight and good will. 
4  For example, in the case of interest rate swaps, 50 per cent of global trades and 90 per cent of standardized swaps 
(i.e. which have to be cleared through a central counterparty) are cleared by the London-based LCH Group Ltd. 
and a very large share is denominated in euros. 
11 
          To the surprise of many analysts, there were no immediate adverse effects of the UK’s 
decision to exit on confidence, investment or the economic outlook. There was a significant but 
orderly devaluation of sterling. 
There is no reason to expect any serious direct and immediate repercussions on the Italian 
economy and banking system. 
Nevertheless,  we  cannot  rule  out  the  possibility  that  difficult  negotiations,  especially  if 
they interact with the increasing global and European political and institutional uncertainty, could 
at a certain point trigger further market turbulence. It is unlikely that Italy would be immune. For 
us, the only way to prepare is to reinforce internal stability, to deal with any fragilities perceived 
by the markets, and to pursue the path of reform. 
What  will  happen  in  the  long  run  is  as  yet  difficult  to  foresee.  History  teaches  us  that 
international  openness  is,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  a  powerful  driver  of  economic  growth.  An 
economist  may find  it  hard  to  believe  that  a  country’s  prosperity  can  be  furthered  by creating 
barriers to the free movement of goods, capital and people. Naturally, a great deal will depend on 
future trade and financial agreements and on global developments. In any case, this is more of a 
risk for the United Kingdom than for the rest of Europe or the world. 
Allow  me  to  close  by  saying  that,  personally,  I  will  miss  my  British  colleagues  in  the 
European institutions that I participate in: not only because of their skill and level of preparation, 
which have always been admirable, but I will also miss their pragmatism, dislike of red tape and 
openness to the market, which has generally characterized their approach. I can only hope that 40 
years of working together has allowed us all to learn from each other’s best qualities.
