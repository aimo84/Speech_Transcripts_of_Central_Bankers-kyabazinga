 I J Macfarlane: Observations regarding stability in the Australian economy 
Talk by Mr I J Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to Business Council of Australia 
Annual Dinner, Melbourne, 8 July 2003. 
 I would like to start by thanking the Business Council of Australia for inviting me to its Annual Dinner. 
This is the first such occasion I have attended, and I note that the price of my invitation is that I have to 
give  the  after-dinner  speech.  Given  the  time  of  day,  you  will  be  pleased  to  hear  that  I  will  confine 
myself to a few simple observations, rather than delivering an economic treatise. 
Some people may be expecting a commentary on the current outlook for monetary policy, but I am 
afraid they will be disappointed. Last week we made a decision on monetary policy at our July Board 
Meeting, and it received a lot of press coverage. Not everyone agreed with the decision, but I have to 
say that I was quite impressed with the quality of the discussion it generated. I think there is a very 
well informed and reasoned appreciation of the conflicting pressures and trade-offs we at the Reserve 
Bank face. Given that, I am reluctant to add any more at this stage, because, no matter how carefully 
modulated my comments, I would run a great risk of destabilising a basically stable situation. 
Instead, I would like to move into my talk by starting with the observation that the Australian economy 
has  now  gained  international  recognition  for  its  stability,  whereas  in  previous  decades  it  was  noted 
more  for  its  booms  and  busts.  In  the  jargon  of  financial  markets,  investing  in  Australia  is  now  a 
(cid:147)stability(cid:148)  or  (cid:147)safe  haven(cid:148)  play  whereas  formerly  it  was  known  as  a  (cid:147)cyclical(cid:148)  play.  The  latter  term 
meant that the Australian economy did better than the world economy when the world economy was 
doing well, and worse when it was doing badly. 
The  change  in  the  world(cid:146)s  perception  of  the  Australian  economy  from  one  of  instability  to  one  of 
stability has obvious advantages to us, but it does not eliminate the need for hard policy decisions - it 
simply changes the nature of those decisions. But before discussing that, I would like to illustrate some 
of the changes in the behaviour of economic variables that have given rise to the changed perception 
of the Australian economy. 
The  first  clear  sign  that  the  Australian 
economy  was  showing  a  new-found 
stability  was  the  way  in  which  it  handled 
the Asian crisis. Although we had a higher 
share  of  our  exports  going  to  the  crisis-
affected  Asian  economies  than  any  other 
developed  country,  we  were  able 
to 
negotiate  this  difficult  period  without  any 
noticeable economic slowdown. It was not 
that  our  exports  were  unaffected  -  total 
exports  fell  by  6  per  cent  in  1997/98  and 
exports  to  Asia  by  19  per  cent  -  but  that 
strong domestic demand offset that effect.

BIS Review 31/2003 
  following 
house-building 
in  2001.  Over 
The  second  episode  where  Australia(cid:146)s 
relative stability showed up was during the 
recent recession that occurred among the 
major  economies 
the 
course  of  that  year,  the  G7  economies 
showed zero growth whereas we grew by 
about  4  per  cent.  Another  interesting 
feature  of  that  period  was  the  divergent 
pattern  between  the  Australian  and  US 
economies.  It  used  to  be  common  to 
remark  on  the  close  link  between  growth 
in  the  Australian  and  US  economies,  but 
that pattern broke down during the recent 
US  recession.  Note  that  we  did  have  a 
slowdown in the second half of 2000, but 
that was a once-off effect caused by a fall 
in 
the 
introduction of the GST.  
Turning to financial variables, the one we 
are  most  frequently  made  aware  of  is 
equity  prices.  Again,  Australia  stands  out 
for  relative  stability.  If  we  compare  the 
behaviour  of 
its 
equivalents in the US, UK and Europe, the 
contrast  is  very  striking.  The  boom  and 
bust behaviour of the other three indices is 
hardly apparent at  all in  our stock prices, 
and  over  the  whole  six-and-a-half  year 
period  since  the  start  of  1997,  our  stock 
market has risen as much from end-point 
to end-point as any of them. 
Two  real  economic  variables  that  are 
closely  related  to  my  previous  graph  are 
business  fixed  investment  and  the  profit 
share  of  GDP.  For  simplicity,  I  have  only 
compared  the  Australian  experience  to 
that  of 
fixed 
investment,  again  we  have  experienced 
none  of  the  boom  and  bust  that  was 
apparent in the US. 
In  fact,  our  business  fixed  investment 
remained  remarkably  subdued  during  the 
period of booming stock markets, but has 
picked  up  over  the  last  18  months  or  so, 
when  it  has  been  most  useful  for  us  in  a 
counter-cyclical sense.

Real Corporate Profits*
The  comparison  for  profits  is  very 
similar. Corporate profits in Australia 
have  risen  relatively  smoothly  over 
the  past  decade,  while  in  the  US 
they  rose  until  about  the  end  of 
1997, but have fallen thereafter. The 
interesting  thing  to  notice  about  the 
US  was  that  profits  were  falling 
through the boom years on the stock 
market of 1998 and 1999. 
I  think  I  have  shown  enough  to  get 
my story across, so I will not labour 
the  point  by  showing  any  more 
comparisons.  Instead,  I  will  try  to 
answer  the  questions  of  why  our 
recent  outcomes  have  been  more 
stable than in the past, and why they 
have  been  more  stable  than  most 
comparable countries. 
The  first  of  these  questions  is  why  has  the  Australian  economy  recently  been  more  stable  than  it 
formerly was? My answer to this is that it is largely the result of policy reforms, but luck also played a 
part, which I will refer to later. On economic policy, I would point to a number of major reforms over the 
past 20 years that have been crucial:

       The floating of the exchange rate. 
The non-inflationary financing of budget deficits through the tender of government debt. 
The move  of monetary  policy  to  one  based  on  an  independent  central  bank  and  inflation-
targeting regime. 
The move towards a more disciplined fiscal policy. 
Labour market deregulation. The main change here was to decentralise, i.e. to move away 
from  a  system  based  on  a  National  Wage  Case  which  awarded  every  worker  a  given 
percentage rise once a year (or, in earlier times, once a quarter). The labour force looks a lot 
different  today,  with  a  considerably  smaller  proportion  working  for  the  government,  and  a 
smaller proportion unionised. 
The  opening  up  of  the  economy  to  international  influences,  both  through  the  reduction  in 
tariffs and the abolition of controls on capital movements. 
Competition  policy  applied  both  to  the  private  sector  and  the  government  sector,  and 
significant privatisation of the latter. 
These changes have generally moved the economy away from centralisation to decentralisation and 
away from regulation towards deregulation. They have resulted in a myriad of small changes occurring 
almost continually, rather than a few large ones. So the economy shows more day-to-day volatility but 
is less likely to build up the pressure that results in crises and large disruptive adjustments. 
There  is  another  reason  why  the  performance  of  the  Australian  economy  has  become more  stable 
than formerly which is not the result of deliberate policy decisions. I refer to the changed behaviour of 
our terms of trade, a subject I have spoken of on many previous occasions. The terms of trade is the 
ratio of the price of our exports to the price of our imports, that is the (cid:147)buying power(cid:148) of our exports. 
For  much  of  the  20th  century  our  terms  of  trade  trended  downwards  because  the  prices  of 
commodities, which make up much of our exports, failed to keep up with the prices of manufactures, 
which make up most of our imports. In my view, this trend started to change about 15 years ago, as 
new sources of low-cost manufactures started to come on stream from Asia, particularly from China. 
Now  it  is  manufactures  prices  that  act  like  (cid:147)commodity(cid:148)  prices,  and  not  just  in  a  trend  sense,  but 
cyclically too. You will note from my next graph that in the recent major-country recession of 2001, our 
terms of trade actually improved. Normally, we would have expected them to fall, which would have 
magnified the contractionary effect of the global slowdown.

National Budget Balance
The second question  is  why has the  Australian 
economy  recently  shown  much  more  stable 
behaviour  than  the  much  larger  and  more 
diversified  US  economy?  This  is  not  what  you 
would normally expect of the two economies on 
the basis of their size or their history. 
I  think  the  major  reason  for  this  is  that  the  US 
had an asset price boom and bust - commonly 
known  as  a  bubble  -  and  we  did  not.  I  have 
already shown the rise then fall in equity prices, 
profits  and  business  investment  in  the  US  and 
the effect this has had on economic activity. The 
US economy is suffering from a hangover after 
the  binge;  we  did  not  have  the  binge  and  so 
have avoided the hangover. 
I would like to say that it was excellent economic 
policy that prevented us from participating in the 
binge, but that would be claiming too much. No-
one really understands the relationship between 
macro-economic  policy  and  asset  price  booms 
and  busts  well  enough  to  make  that  claim.  The 
unfortunate fact is that it seems to be possible to 
experience an asset price boom in an economy 
where  macro-economic  policy  settings  seem  to 
be  relatively  well  disciplined  and  inflation  quite 
restrained. 
One  thing  we  do  know,  however,  both  from  the 
US  experience  and 
the  earlier  Japanese 
experience,  is  that  once  the  asset  price  boom 
has turned into a bust, the effect on the macro-
economic policy settings is profound. Partly this 
is  because  the  contracting  economy  affects  the 
policy  settings,  and  partly  it  is  because  policy-
makers  are  quick  to  adjust  their  levers  in  an 
attempt to head off the contraction. 
Again,  a  comparison  with  the  US  makes  the 
point.  On  fiscal  policy,  the  Australian  budgetary 
position  has  varied  little  over  recent  years,  with 
predominantly small surpluses being the order of 
the  day.  In  contrast,  the  US  budgetary  position 
has moved from a surplus of 2 per cent of GDP in 
2000 to an expected deficit of 4 per cent of GDP 
in 2003. The US has used a huge amount of its 
fiscal ammunition, while we have not even started 
to do so. 
On monetary policy, the contrast between the two 
countries  is  equally  pronounced.  The  US  put 
interest  rates  up  slightly  more  than  we  did  in 
1999/2000,  but 
the  difference  was  minor. 
However,  since  the  US  recession  hit  in  2001, 
they have reduced their interest rates much more 
than us. From a peak in the second half of 2000, 
they have come down by  5‰ percentage points, 
while  we  have  come  down  in  net  terms  by 
1‰ percentage points. I do not want to give the impression that I think stability of interest rates is a 
goal in its own right - only that it reflects the greater stability of the Australian economy.

 BIS Review 31/2003
 Again, the contrast in both of the above policy variables between the two countries is as great as the 
contrast in the other variables I showed earlier, with Australia again representing stability and the US 
instability. Equally importantly, stability was not pushed at the price of lower growth: to the contrary, 
the Australian economy has grown faster than the US, not just over the past few years, but over the 
past  decade.  This,  of  course,  has  been  the  main  point  of  my  presentation  this  evening.  The  other 
point, I hope that has come out, is that the really large examples of instability in recent decades have 
emanated from a species of financial event - namely, an asset price boom and bust - rather than from 
the normal cyclical fluctuations we are all familiar with under the heading of the business cycle.
