Pavel Racocha: Joining the EU - Impact on the financial sector of new member 
states 
Speech  by  Mr  Pavel  Racocha,  member  of  the  Board  of  the  Czech  National  Bank,  delivered  at  the 
conference  entitled  "The  Single  Market  for  Financial  Services  in  the  EU  and  Its  Impact  on 
Globalization", Sydney, 3 November 2003. 
 On May 1st, 2004, ten countries will join the European Union. Will the transition proceed smoothly? 
The  main  concern  related  to  new  countries  joining  the  EU,  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  financial 
sector,  is  what  impact  the  enlargement  will  have  on  the  functioning  of  financial  markets  in  new 
member  states.  Will  competition  in  financial  services  increase  and  place  a  strain  on  institutions  in 
accession countries or in the EU as well? Will there be visible impact at all? The new member states 
consist of eight former transition economies and of Malta and Cyprus. I will focus on developments in 
the transition countries, and especially in the Czech Republic, which I know best. I will also try to make 
reference to other accession countries to show that the results of developments over the last thirteen 
years, at least in the financial sector, are not so different.  
This brief presentation cannot do more than deliver only a basic description of the past development of 
financial markets in the transition countries and of their current standing. Hopefully the data from this 
presentation can serve as background information for those interested in further studies. 
The financial sectors of the new Accession Countries have undergone huge and substantial reforms 
over last 13 years. When communism collapsed, there were no traces of a market economy, no free 
and  legal  entrepreneurial  economic  activity,  and  no  institutions  necessary  for  the  functioning  of  a 
market  economy.  If  we  look  at  the  transition  economies  -  which  represent  8  out  of  10  acceding 
countries - today, we see a completely different picture. The basic institutions are in place and running 
(though sometimes slowly and not always predictably). The private part of the economy flourishes and 
is the symbol of a new and well functioning economy. How did this happen? And what happened to 
the financial sector? And what will be the impact of the accession to the EU on the financial sector, 
which in the accession countries is synonymous with the banking sector. 
In  1990,  the  average  starting  point  for  reforms  in  the  former  socialist  countries,  the  situation  in  the 
financial sector was bleak. There were no services aside from basic banking and insurance functions. 
The banking sector was comprised of few specialized institutions, each of them a monopoly in its own 
area [one institution had monopoly on collecting deposits from the public, another institution provided 
all the foreign trade financing, and yet another institution was allowed to open accounts for individuals 
with foreign exchange incomes]. Then there was a monobank, the most important financial institution, 
which performed both functions, of a commercial bank and of the central bank [however skewed that 
could  have  been  in  the  centrally  planned  economy].  We  should  also  understand  that  commercial 
banking was not about evaluating loan applications and looking at projects’ fundamentals or clients’ 
credentials. In the former socialist countries, there was a State Planning Commission that decided how 
much of certain production would get produced and by whom. The role of the banks was limited only 
to finding funds for financing the planned production.  
It is important to acknowledge the situation at the outset of economic and political reforms. This would 
also help us to understand some of the problems that the transition economies went through later on. 
Thirteen years ago there were basically no real banks, no capital markets, no experienced staff and no 
experienced management. In addition to that, there was no capital in the banks. The ratio of capital to 
banks’ assets was on average well below 1%. At the same time, there was a boom in entrepreneurial 
activities, with tens of thousands of new companies sprouting up. Their common characteristic was 
that they had no history, no experience, no capital, but great need for debt financing. On top of this, all 
the laws were changing, institutions [such as prudential banking supervision] were built only gradually, 
and the state as decisive owner in the banking sector was not up to its duties as good manager. As 
said  above,  the  banking  sector  represented  the  crucial  part  of  the  financial  sector  of  the  country. 
Therefore,  it  was  also  the  one  to  be  hit  the  most  seriously  in  the  course  of  the  economic  reform, 
especially  on  the  credit  allocation  side.  On  the  contrary,  deposits  continued  to  grow  despite  the 
negative real interest rate.

The  economic

foreign  exchange  liberalization.  Given  the  depth  of  the  economic  transformation,  the  transition 
countries achieved relatively quickly a generally stable environment after the initial shock.

As already mentioned, since the financial sector consisted mainly of the banking sector, the impact of 
economic  reform  was  felt  mainly  by  the  banks.  There  was  no  alternative  source  of  financing  for 
corporations, so difficulties in the corporate sector were passed on directly to the banks. The situation 
was  complicated  more  by  the  fact  that  the  government  owned  some  of  the  most  important 
corporations,  as  well  as  the  main  banks.  Political  rationale  preceded  economics.  In  most  of  the 
countries, the privatization of most firms happened early in the transformation process. Banks were an 
exception to this, and in different countries, the approach to privatization of banks varied. In the Czech 
Republic, the privatization of banks had been delayed for several years due to the government’s belief 
that  privatized  banks  would  stop  providing  soft  loans  to  strategically  important  firms.  This  fear  was 
underlined by the experience with foreign banks that were entering the market since 1992 and cherry-
picking their clients. After several years, the bad debt burden on banks’ balance sheets reached such 
a scale that government had to step in. Most of the debt ended up with a special governmental agency 
and  the  losses  are  being  paid  from  the  state  budget.  The  cost  of  the  bank  clean-up  in  the  Czech 
Republic is estimated at approximately 21% of GDP. In some other countries [Hungary, Poland], the 
privatization of banks proceeded quicker and the fiscal costs were substantially smaller [est. 6% for 
Poland, 13% for Hungary; in Szapáry, National Bank of Hungary, 2001].  
Given  what  I  have  just  described,  the  financial  sector  in  the  accession  countries  is  nowadays  in 
remarkably  good  shape.  The  banking  sector  is  sound  and  stable,  the  role  of  non-banking 
intermediation is growing, and clients have access to most of the products and services they have in 
the EU countries.  
Following  table  illustrates  the  importance  of  the  banking  sector  in  three  major  accession  countries 
[Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland]:

It is evident that the financial sector in Central European countries relies heavily on the banking sector, 
which represents approximately 80% of total assets of the whole financial sector. It could be also seen 
that  despite  the  dominance  of  banks  in  all  mentioned  countries,  the  structure  of  other  financial 
institutions differs significantly. This is the result of varying approaches to building these institutions. 
For  instance,  in  the  Czech  Republic,  we  can  see  the  smaller  size  of  the  investment  business  as  a 
result of the quality of the capital markets, the lax regulation at the beginning of the transformation, 
and the subsequent and rather frequent occurrence of frauds in the past. The delayed start of pension 
reform has also contributed to this situation. 
The largest banking sector in the new member states is the Polish one, followed by the Czech and the 
Hungarian sectors. These three biggest countries account for more than 3/4 of the total new member 
states  banking  assets.  The  banking  sector  of  all  new  member  states  is  nevertheless  very  small  in 
comparison with the EU market. The total banking sector assets in all new member states are only 
345 USD billions at the end 2002 (thus just 31,5% of Citigroup, or 43,4% of Deutsche bank, or 45,5% 
of HSBC).

 A look at financial depth [as measured by banking sector assets to GDP] of individual markets in five 
accession countries [Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and Slovenia] shows that there is still 
significant space for growth of financial intermediation. Financial depth in the CR is the highest among 
the transition economies, but it is still significantly lower than in the EU [EU average 270%].

 Besides developments  in banking, we can  observe continuous growth also  in non-banking financial 
intermediation  [illustrated  by  Czech  Republic].  In  the  Czech  Republic,  the  share  of  non-banking 
financial  intermediation  on  GDP  increased  over  last  two  years  from  19%  to  21,7%.  The  highest 
increase  was  in  the  share  of  insurance  companies  and  financial  leasing  institutions.  However,  the 
majority  of  these  non-banking  financial  intermediators  is  controlled  by  financial  groups  headed  by 
commercial  banks.  A  relatively  low  share  of  investment  companies  and  investment  funds  were 
negatively  influenced  by  missing  regulation  and  supervision  in  this  field,  however,  there  has  been 
gradual  improvement  in  recent  years.  In  the  area  of  pension  funds  we  also  witness  gradual 
improvement caused mostly by government incentives, but we can expect quicker development if the 
government proceeds with intended pension reform.

The  banking  sector  generally  consists  of  previously  state  owned  banks  [since  privatized  to  foreign 
banks],  new  banks  established  after  1990  as  private  institutions,  and  subsidiaries  and  branches  of 
foreign banks. The approach to bank privatization differed in the new member states, but the results 
are now rather comparable. The banking sector is dominated by institutions governed by foreign banks 
[mainly from the EU], with exceptions being Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus.

 Who  are  the  main  players  in  the  market  of  the  new  member  states?  Among  the  most  influential 
institutions in the region we find Krediet Bank Bruxelles from Belgium, Erste Bank and Raiffeisen Bank 
from Austria, HVB Group and Bayerische Landesbank from Germany, Societé Generale from France 
and  Unicredito  Italiano  from  Italy.  The  limited  group  of  non-EU  banks  is  lead  by  Citibank  and  GE 
Capital.  Unlike  in  Central  Europe,  in  the  Baltic  states  the  foreign  investors  come  from  the 
Scandinavian countries, mainly Sweden and Finland - Hansabank, Group Nordea and Sampo Bank.

As said above, the economic transformation had a large negative impact on balance sheets. Banks 
tended  to  lend  to  previously  existing  companies  undergoing  privatization  that  were  faced  with  a 
sudden loss of foreign demand (mainly from Soviet Union) and had to restructure themselves by laying 
off a big part of their workforce. This proved to be a recipe for financial disaster. Financing of newly 
established companies with no track record, with business plans based more often on good intentions 
than on thorough analysis was no better. In addition, the political elite, who saw bank financing as the 
quintessential source of economic growth, encouraged this lending boom. Existing risks were widely 
disregarded. This inevitably led to a very grim situation in the banking sector, where many of the newly 
established banks collapsed under the burden of bad debts. The state-owned banks had to have their 
capital replenished by the government. Balance sheet cleaning was also one of the preconditions for 
banks’ successful privatization in the late 90’s.

 Nowadays, the existing banks are well capitalized, the level of bad loans is relatively low and adequate 
provisions  and  reserves  are  made.  Despite  the  decreasing  net  interest  margin,  the  profitability  has 
improved,  especially  thanks  to  an  increasing  portion  of  banks’  income  coming  from  fees  and 
commissions.

 The  legislative  and  regulatory  framework  has  been  already  harmonized  with  the  EU  requirements. 
Special  missions  of  experts  from  the  EU  countries  have  confirmed  this  in  all  of  the  new  member 
states.  However,  the  acqui  communautaire  are  still  developing  and  improving.  This  represents 
additional challenge for the new member states, since they must first adopt the existing rules, and also 
get ready for the coming changes.  
The new member states are ready for application of Single Passport policy [it basically means that any 
bank  from  any  EU  country  could  provide  services  in  the  whole  EU  without  additional  licensing 
requirements.].  Since  the  domestic  banking  markets  in  the  new  member  countries  are  competitive 
enough and have already a strong presence of foreign institutions, this should not lead to dramatic 
changes in lending in these countries.  
Being  a  part  of  larger  economic  area,  with  banking  sectors  dominated  by  foreign  institutions,  will 
represent a new challenge for bank supervisors. The need for greater and more efficient cross-border 
cooperation will probably lead to changes in focus of the supervisory agencies.   
After  their  accession  to  the  EU,  I  do  not  expect  any  contagion  effect  among  the  Central  European 
countries in case of difficulties of one of them. The institutional investors do not any longer view these 
countries as very coherent group. This assertion can be illustrated on developments of the exchange 
rate over the past two years. We can observe that the developments in the individual countries have 
little  in  common  and  the  exchange  rates  followed  paths  reflecting  domestic  developments  in  the 
individual countries.

 Discussion  needs  to  continue  about  potential  risks,  such  as  increased  competitive  pressure  or 
implementation  of  new  sophisticated  financial  products.  It  is  also  expected  that  some  of  the  most 
sophisticated risk management techniques will be done on group wide level and thus outside of the 
host country jurisdictions. There will be some risks and potential threats arising from the changes. But 
at this time, there is not a single specific risk that would threaten to disrupt the banking and financial 
services in the new member states after becoming part of the single market. 
Capital  markets  in  the  new  member  states  were  previously  non-existent.  In  the  Czech  Republic,  a 
capital market was developed as a “byproduct” of the voucher privatization. Introduction of regulation 
and supervision was delayed and the Securities and Exchange Commission was created only a few 
years after the market had existed.  
The  capital  market  is  stagnating  as  a  result  of  voucher  privatization,  during  which  the  number  of 
shares congested the market. This subsequently lead to large de-listing of the number of shares from 
the market (the number of shares traded now is 23 times smaller than in 1995, just after the voucher 
privatization). The market was also plagued by frauds and non-transparent behavior. The volumes and 
market capitalization has stagnated, 88,5% of total volume is concentrated into 5 shares. There has 
never  been  any  IPO,  and  even  the  good  companies  are  de-listed  from  the  market  after  their 
privatization (such as Ceska Sporitelna, the largest Czech retail bank). Capital markets in some of the 
other new member states function arguably better than the Czech one, nevertheless their significance 
is also much less than in more developed countries. The aggregate equity market capitalization in all 
new member states represents less than 2% of market capitalization in the EU. The Warsaw Stock 
Exchange is the largest one in the region [40% of total].

 In  bond  trading,  the  situation  is  slightly  more  optimistic.  The  volume  traded  is  approximately  eight 
times the size of share trading and there is much higher liquidity. Continuous increase in volume is 
mainly due to the issuance of new public debt.

 What will the future bring to capital markets? It is evident that with limited share trading, there is not a 
very rosy future ahead. There are discussions about merging the markets in the region and possibly 
joining some European Stock Exchange. There are some speculations about the Stock Exchange in 
Vienna  wanting  to  be  the  market  for  the  region  [Vienna  is  the  second  smallest  SE  in  the  EU.]. 
However, individual countries would prefer to either remain independent, or to cooperate more closely 
with some bigger partners - such as the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. 
As shown above, the financial sector is generally in good shape. There are some differences among 
the  individual  parts  of  the  financial  sector,  but  the  main  part  [the  banking  sector]  is  as  sound  and

strong  as  never  before.  This  is  due  to  several  reasons,  such  as  the  improving  legal  environment, 
improving management, or even outright government financial assistance in the past. However, the 
greatest difference is due to the privatization to foreign banking institutions. These institutions have 
brought all the necessary components for successful long-term banking. 
The  legislative  and  regulatory  framework  has  been  harmonized with  the  acqui communautaire.  The 
harmonization has been confirmed by EC Peer reviews and by the multinational financial institutions 
(such as the IMF and World Bank during their FSAP process). Of course, there is still a lot of work to 
be done. The legislation and regulation shall be more streamlined, the area of law enforcement needs 
to function more efficiently, changes in accounting standards must be made. But these tasks are not 
related purely to the EU accession. They would have to be done under any circumstances.  
The  financial  sectors  in  the  new  member  states  are  functioning  efficiently,  and  are  stable  and 
competitive. The majority of financial sectors are in foreign hands, well capitalized and well managed. 
Institutions  from  the  EU  are  governing  the  largest  financial  institutions  in  the  new  member  states. 
Introduction  of  the  Single  Passport  policy  will  mean  a  change  only  de  iure,  not  de  facto.  Foreign 
institutions that wanted to provide their services in the new member states are already present there. I 
do not expect any rush of new players to the new countries of the European Union. It is more probable 
that  with  increasing  living  standards  of  the  population,  the  space  for  new  financial  products’ 
penetration  will  increase  as  well.  I  expect  to  see  increased  competition  in  this  area,  as  already 
established institutions compete for new clients. It is unlikely that many new financial institutions will 
enter the market, because the market is already saturated, and players who had a strategic interest in 
Central Europe have already established themselves. 
Authorities  from  the  new  countries  are  already  participating  in  committees  and  working  groups 
established by the European Commission and European Central Bank, so that rules, as well as the 
policy thinking are being coordinated and harmonized. 
Challenges  from  the  EU  accession  will  therefore  not  represent  any  major  risk.  The  problems  and 
challenges that the new member states will face are not any different from those that are faced by the 
“old”  member  states,  such  as  implementing  the  new  Basle  Capital  Accord,  implementing  the  IAS, 
increasing cross-border cooperation, monitoring activities of large complex financial groups, evaluating 
new complicated financial products, understanding risk transfer among different financial institutions. 
The transition will greatly benefit from the hard work that has been done during the economic transition 
and  during  the  preparatory  stages  for  the  EU accession.  It  will  be  smooth  and  I  do  not  expect  any 
disruption of financial service in the new member states, or in the EU as a whole.  
It could be said that the financial sector is already in the European Union.
