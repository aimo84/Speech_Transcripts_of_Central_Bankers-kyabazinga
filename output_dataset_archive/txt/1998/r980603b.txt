Mr. Heikensten examines economic policy and the fight against inflation in Sweden
Speech  by  the  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Sweden,  Mr.  Lars  Heikensten,  at  the  Meeting  of
Almega-Affiliated Employers’ Associations on 27/5/98.
Thank you for the invitation to attend your meeting and talk about economic policy and
inflation.  Today  I  shall  begin  with  a  brief  review  of  the  historical  background  to  the  fight  against
inflation in the Swedish economy. It is worth recalling that more than eight years have passed since it
was decided in Sweden that combating inflation would have top priority. This policy has been pursued
consistently ever since. After a couple of initial years that were troublesome in many ways, the results
have been encouraging and Swedish stabilisation policy now looks good even in a European comparison.
This  will  be  followed  by  a  discussion  of  three  policy  fields—fiscal  policy,  labour  market  and  wage
formation—that  are  closely  linked  to  monetary  policy,  as  well  as  some  remarks  about  competitive
conditions in Sweden’s economy. Successful results in these policy fields enlarge the room to manoeuvre
in  monetary  policy.  In  conclusion  I  shall  consider  some  topical  monetary  policy  issues,  including  our
current appraisal of inflation and monetary policy’s construction.
1.  The fight against inflation and its results
High inflation characterised Sweden’s economy for a number of years in the 1970s and
1980s, a period that clearly illustrates an inflation economy’s negative consequences. Repeated attempts
were  made  to  rectify  the  economic  imbalances  by  means  of  devaluations  and  fiscal  stimuli  but
development remained unstable. The problems with inflation were then accentuated when the financial
markets were deregulated. Prices and wages rose steeply and Sweden was caught in wage-price spirals.
The  occurrence  of  price  bubbles  made  investment  decisions  more  hazardous  and  led  to  weak
productivity. A high level of inflation became a permanent feature of our economy. As monetary policy
at that time was focused on maintaining a fixed exchange rate, fiscal policy ought to have been tighter.
Bit by bit, there was a growing awareness across party political lines that in the longer
run this economic policy strategy was not viable, a perception that had already dawned on most countries
in our part of the world in the early 1980s. It was now that low inflation in Sweden came to be seen as a
necessary condition for achieving stable and sustained growth and thereby high employment. This was
clearly  expressed  officially  for  the  first  time  in  the  Budget  Statement  in  January  1991.  Combating
inflation was given pride of place on the economic policy agenda. The final policy objectives were the
same as before but the perception of the conditions that were needed to attain them had changed.
This realignment of stabilisation policy occurred, however, at a time when the earlier
policy’s  negative  consequences  had  begun  to  leave  their  mark.  Due  to  the  high  level  of  costs  in
manufacturing, for example, economic growth in Sweden was weak. In addition, a rising real interest rate
coincided with a period when the tax reform made savers and investors more sensitive to interest rates.
All this had a marked downward effect on domestic demand.
The drop in output—almost 6 per cent in the course of three years—meant in turn thatgovernment finances worsened dramatically. From a surplus at 4.2 per cent of GDP in 1990, the budget
balance swung to a deficit of 12.3 per cent in 1993. In this period, moreover, registered unemployment
shot up from 1.7 to 8.2 per cent.
In a way, the economic crisis in the early 1990s can be said to have been generated by
political decisions. The combination of a stabilisation policy realignment with some structural reforms
did  play  a  part  in  the  course  of  the  crisis.  But  it  should  also  be  underscored  that  such  measures  were
broadly  essential.  The  problem  was  not  so  much  the  measures  that  were  implemented  when  an
inflationary bubble had already developed as the fact that policy had not been realigned earlier.
In  recent  years,  economic  developments  in  Sweden  have  been  favourable.  Growth  has
been stronger than in the high phase in the late 1980s and it has proved possible to combine good growth
with  low  inflation.  A  couple  of  years  after  the  realignment  of  economic  policy,  inflation  had  fallen
BIS Review   47/1998
- 2 -
sharply to around 3 per  cent.  Moreover,  the  reduction  of  current  inflation  has  been  accompanied  by  a
downward  revision  of  inflation  expectations.  Today,  neither  households,  firms  nor  financial  market
agents perceive any serious threat from inflation in the coming five years.
Government finances have also improved markedly since the effects of the acute crisis in
the early 1990s were overcome. After rapid budget consolidation, a surplus of 1.6 per cent is forecast for
1998. Government debt has been reduced since 1995. Still, the restoration of confidence did take a long
time.  There  were  strong  and  persistent  doubts  about  both  the  determination  and  the  ability  of  the
Government and the Riksdag (Sweden’s parliament) to carry out the proposed measures.
Finally it is worth noting that the steps for reorienting economic policy on stability were
taken  with  a  consensus  that  was  considerably  broader  than  is  sometimes  suggested  by  the  political
debate. A good foundation for the years ahead has now been laid, although high unemployment is still a
serious problem for Sweden’s economy. The positive picture is underpinned by institutional reforms to
the budget process and the status of the Riksbank.
2.  Three fields of importance for monetary policy
Now  I  should  like  to  turn  to  some  issues  or  policy  fields  that  are  of  major  practical
importance  for  monetary  policy.  They  are:  fiscal  policy,  the  labour  market,  wage  formation  and
competitive conditions in the Swedish economy. It is generally the case that the more price stability is
supported  by  other  policy  fields,  the  greater  the  contribution  monetary  policy  can  make  to  other
economic policy goals.
Good fiscal foundation but storing up for lean years is advisable
Fiscal policy is relevant for monetary policy in a number of ways. Fiscal decisions affect
the room to manoeuvre in monetary policy not only via their direct impact on demand—and hence on
inflation—but also by how they influence economic policy’s credibility. A fiscal policy that is perceived
as  being  untenable  in  the  longer  run  can  raise  doubts  about  the  overall  policy  commitment  to  low
inflation and stability. To this should be added fiscal policy’s influence on the macro economy. The ways
in which taxes are levied and public revenue is spent influence the behaviour of households and firms,
which  may  thereby—generally  in  the  longer  run—alter  the  economy’s  inflation  propensity.  Today,
however, I shall not be developing this aspect.
In the first respect—fiscal policy’s impact on economic activity—the picture is clear-cut:
in recent years the fiscal stance has been very tight. Of course, this has contributed to the low  rate  of
inflation and in this sense it has assisted monetary policy. With the current fiscal proposals for the years
ahead, however, the stance will not be as tight as before. But to some extent the growth of household
income is still being restrained by the overall change in taxation and public spending.
As regards credibility, there has been a marked improvement. Last year the Government
laid  down  a  long-term  objective  for  government  finances  which  goes  further  than  the  average  of  the
corresponding  commitments  in  Europe.  Over  the  business  cycle  the  budget  balance  is  to  average  a
surplus of 2 per cent of GDP. The Riksdag has approved this objective.
The Riksbank finds this objective reasonable. A budget surplus over the business cycle
can  contribute  to  a  speedier  reduction  of  government  debt,  which  is  currently  high.  This  will  create
greater freedom of action for future economic policy, which is particularly important in that Sweden’s
public finances are no doubt still relatively sensitive to the cyclical economic situation. But the future has
further challenges in store for fiscal policy. An ageing population implies new and growing requirements,
for example. Another matter that may alter the conditions for fiscal policy is the increased mobility of tax
bases, which in some respects may make it difficult to maintain present levels of taxation.
Better wage settlements but what about the next round?
BIS Review   47/1998

As things now stand, fiscal policy will continue to provide good room to manoeuvre in
monetary policy in the coming years. So what about the contributions from the labour market and wage
formation?
Of  the  aggregate  value-added  in  the  Swedish  economy,  wages  make  up  almost  70  per
cent. Wage trends are therefore crucial for the path of inflation. For many years, the wage rise in Sweden
has been  above  the  rate  in  most  other  countries  in  Europe.  But  as  we  all  know,  instead  of  this  giving
Swedish employees a better real wage, the outcome has been the reverse. In the 1990s the rate of wage
increases  in  Sweden  has  been  curbed  but  the  negotiated  increases  in  the  1995  round  were  above  the
European average.
As  I  mentioned  earlier,  economic  policy  in  Sweden  has  been  focused  on  low  inflation
since 1991. A consistent implementation of this policy, with an inflation target, clarifies the rules of the
game for wage formation. High wage  increases  are  liable  to  boost  inflation,  which  necessitates  higher
interest rates.
The  inflationary  consequences  of  the  wage  increases  can  be  modified  if  productivity
growth is good, as has been the case in recent years. But at  least  a  part  of  this  productivity  growth  is
achieved at the expense of jobs; this is one aspect of the process whereby higher labour costs generate
stronger rationalisation and maybe also an increased capital input. In this way, too, and not just because
the higher interest rates directly affect demand and employment, a rapid wage rise is liable to endanger
jobs.
Against  this  background,  the  outcome  of  the  latest  wage  negotiations  is  better  than  in
earlier years. Agreements for the next three years have been concluded at levels around 3 per cent a year.
It has been said that this takes wage drift into account but that is probably not entirely the case. Instead
one should no doubt count on wage drift averaging around 1 per cent. The average annual wage outcome
in the period 1998–2000 would then be 3.5 to 4 per cent. This does still represent some downward shift
in the rate of wage increases, which in turn assists the Riksbank’s task of ensuring low inflation. All else
equal, we can allow ourselves a somewhat lower level of interest rates and a somewhat stronger growth
of demand.
Speaking to you, it seems natural to take up two more aspects of this issue:
-  The outcome of the 1998 wage round does not appear to be sufficiently low to make a
major contribution to employment in Sweden. But our wage level is still rising faster, if anything, than
the European average. This may prove to be manageable as regards inflation and Sweden’s competitive
position, thanks to good productivity growth, but what will it then entail for employment?
-  Neither is it easy to feel really confident about the next wage round. What was really
responsible for the better outcome this year compared with 1995? The greater credibility of the inflation
target  can  be  cited  as  one  explanation  but  is  it  the  whole  story?  And  if  not,  what  were  the  other
arguments on this occasion and will they still hold good in two to three years time? These are important
questions that need to be analysed and answered, in the first place by the parties in the labour market.
Better competition and price formation but there is more to do
A third issue, which presumably has had practical consequences for monetary policy and
the  fight  against  inflation  in  recent  years,  although  it  is  seldom  discussed  in  these  contexts,  is  the
competitive situation in the Swedish economy.
In work at the Riksbank on monitoring prices in the Swedish economy, we could not fail
to notice some positive changes in competitive conditions and pricing in recent years, as well as some
more negative patterns that seem to be persisting.
BIS Review   47/1998
- 4 -
Let  me  take  the  positive  aspects  first.  One  is  the  favourable  price  trend  for  imported
goods in recent years. This is particularly notable in that for much of this period the exchange rate has
been comparatively weak, which by itself should push import prices up. A favourable price trend has also
been  observed  for  food  products,  for  example;  this  seems  to  be  a  consequence,  at  least  in  part,  of
Sweden’s  membership  of  the  European  Union.  Today,  moreover,  there  are  many  indications  that  the
combination  of  European  monetary  union  and  increased  IT-based  trade,  for  instance,  will  make
competition even stronger.
There is a general difference between the development of administered prices and market
prices  for  goods  and  services.  The  administered  prices  have  risen  faster.  This  may  be  a  result  of
increased fee setting in the public sector in recent years, both in connection with structural moves away
from tax financing and to fill existing “holes” in public finances. Then there is the classic explanation
that  it  is  not  so  easy  to  raise  productivity  growth  in  some  parts  of  the  services  sector.  This  no  doubt
applies in particular to a number of the services that are mainly provided under public auspices, such as
medical care and care of the aged.
I have raised the questions of competitive conditions and price formation today mainly so
as  to  help  initiate  a  debate  on  these  matters.  For  monetary  policy  it  is  self-evidently  the  case  that
increased competition, by keeping costs and prices down, can lead to better inflation prospects. This in
turn can improve the conditions for monetary policy.
In recent years there have been indications of tendencies in this direction, in Sweden as
well as globally. At the same time, it is difficult to tell just how much of the reduction of inflation can be
attributed  specifically  to  changes  in  competition  and  price  formation.  Neither  is  it  clear  for  how  long
such a process can continue and whether the same potential exists for keeping prices down over a series
of years. These are matters to which we intend to return.
3.  Some monetary policy issues
Sweden  has  had  good  experience,  as  I  demonstrated  earlier,  of  efforts  to  establish
credibility by  means  of  a  direct  inflation  target.  Inflation  is  currently  low  and  the  level  is  expected  to
remain low in the coming years. The conditions for continuing with monetary policy’s focus on stability
are  being  further  improved  by  the  far-reaching  delegation  of  monetary  policy  that  is  involved  in  the
Riksbank’s enhanced status from the turn of this year. Against this background, I should like to comment
on some of monetary policy’s topical issues.
The exchange rate
The part played by the krona’s exchange rate is a matter for debate  that  surfaces  from
time to time. A recent instance is, for example, the run up to European monetary union and the attention
this drew to Sweden’s commitments as a member of the European Union. Some observers believe that
the  Riksbank  may  have  an  (unacknowledged)  exchange  rate  target.  That  is  a  misconception.  The
Riksbank does not target the krona’s exchange rate.
In  a  flexible  exchange  rate  regime  with  a  price  stability  target,  the  exchange  rate  is
admittedly  a  major  factor,  but  only  one  of  many  factors  that  impinge  on  inflation.  A  permanent
appreciation or depreciation of the krona affects inflationary pressure via import prices, for example. A
given exchange rate trend may well support monetary policy’s drive for price stability; when this is not
the case, however, the Riksbank has to intervene and adjust the repo rate.
At the same time, the exchange rate is the price of an asset that is current throughout the
economy; the value of the krona  is  highly  important  in  many  economic  decisions,  not  least  for  export
companies. This makes a stable exchange rate fundamentally desirable. It is then easier for all economic
agents to make decisions. All else equal, this should lead to higher growth.
BIS Review   47/1998
- 5 -
To  this  basic  endeavour  to  keep  the  price  of  the  krona  stable  should  be  added  our
European undertakings. As a member of the European Union we are committed to treating our exchange
rate policy as a matter of common interest. Opinions in the Union presumably differ from time to time
about  the  practical  application  of  this  commitment  but  the  basic  requirement  is  that  policy  focuses
consistently on stability.
The Riksdag has left the door open for Sweden’s participation in the monetary union at a
later date and stated that in connection with such a move it can be relevant to join the European exchange
rate mechanism (ERM). In this perspective, too, it is an advantage if the krona is more or less stable.
Monetary policy in the euro area is to have the primary objective of price stability. We
do not yet know just how the European Central Bank (ECB) will formulate its target but it is unlikely to
differ from the norm that has applied in Germany since the mid 1980s. This means that inflation is not to
exceed  a  medium-term  level  of  2  per  cent.  In  practice,  therefore,  the  differences  in  this  policy  field
between the ECB  and  Sweden  will  probably  not  be  so  great  as  to  have  any  real  consequences  for  the
exchange rate.
With policy focused on price stability both in Sweden and in the monetary union, there
should be good possibilities of a stable exchange rate between the krona and the euro. This is supported
by the path of the krona relative to the German mark in recent years. As measured, for example, by the
long-term interest rate differential with Germany, confidence in Swedish economic policy has been high
since 1996. In this period there have been only two occasions when the krona has fluctuated more than 2
per cent against the German mark.
Managing transitory effects
The subject of the Riksbank’s attitude to the inflation target is also raised from time to
time  in  the  media.  It  has  been  claimed  that  the  Riksbank  shows  less  concern  about  inflation  moving
outside the tolerance interval’s lower limit than it does about the upper limit being exceeded.
That is not the case. A couple of years is too short a period on which to base arguments
that  deviations  from  the  targeted  rate  are  a  sign  that  policy  has  not  been  symmetric.  Monetary  policy
work involves a lot of uncertainty, which is no doubt inevitable when the interest rate has to be set on the
basis  of  forecasts  that  extend  several  years  into  the  future.  At  present,  moreover,  assessments  are
particularly difficult so soon after the changeover to a low-inflation regime, with all that this may involve
in the form of altered behaviour by households and firms. Another complication is that in recent years,
inflation throughout the world has been lower than expected.
Another  aspect  of  this  issue  is  the  Riksbank’s  choice  of  a  target  variable.  Every
conceivable  indicator  of  inflation  has  its  shortcomings  and  these  have  to  be  weighed  against  the
advantages  when  choosing  monetary  policy’s  target  variable.  The  consumer  price  index  (CPI)  has  the
advantages  of  being  well-known  and  established  among  economic  agents  and  people  in  general  as  a
measure  of  inflation.  It  also  covers  a  large  proportion  of  household  consumption.  These  were  central
arguments when the CPI was chosen as the target variable in the beginning of 1993.
A disadvantage with the CPI, however, is that it combines information about inflation’s
underlying trend with transitory price movements. In the period in which the inflation target has been in
force, transitory factors have had a marked effect on the CPI on a number of occasions. Examples of such
factors are tax changes (most recently the increases to and subsequent cuts in property and tobacco taxes)
and  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  (which  affect  the  CPI  in  the  form  of  house  mortgage  expenditure).
During 1996 and 1997 in particular the CPI has been relatively markedly below not just the targeted rate
but even the tolerance interval. This has faced the Riksbank with educational problems.
Transitory effects on inflation ought to be a secondary consideration in monetary policy
and be absorbed inside the tolerance interval of 1–3 per cent. That is one of the interval’s functions. And
BIS Review   47/1998
- 6 -
provided  it  is  a  question  of  temporary  price  movements  around  a  stable  rate  of  inflation,  there  is  no
reason  to  counter  such  movements  with  repo  rate  adjustments.  On  the  contrary,  that  might  have  a
destabilising  effect  in  the  real  economy.  Instead,  monetary  policy’s  central  concern  is  the  direction  of
inflation’s long-term trend. It is this trend which can be affected more directly by total demand and hence
by monetary policy.
Against  this  background,  the  Riksbank  has  contacted  the  CPI  Enquiry,  set  up  by  the
Government,  to  obtain  assistance  in  specifying  an  indicator  of  underlying  inflation  that  is  likely  to  be
widely  accepted  and  can  be  published  regularly  by  Statistics  Sweden.  In  the  future,  such  an  indicator
might be able to have a more direct function in monetary policy, either by replacing the CPI as the target
variable or by serving as an operational target or aid in the continuous work of constructing policy. The
Riksbank  has  also  asked  Statistics  Sweden  to  publish,  for  the  time  being,  one  or  more  indicators  of
underlying inflation together with the CPI. Perhaps I should emphasise that in no way do these initiatives
alter monetary policy’s fundamental commitment to price stability.
The current situation for monetary policy
The  question  of  transitory  effects  leads  me  on  to  current  monetary  policy.  Transitory
effects  are  playing  a  major  part  in  the  CPI’s  present  development.  As  a  result  of  tax  changes,  lower
interest  rates  and  a  lower  oil  price,  since  December  the  Riksbank  has  had  to  revise  the  1998  CPI
prediction  downwards  by  about  1.2  percentage  points.  In  1999,  too,  transitory  effects  mean  that  CPI
inflation will be lower than we envisaged earlier.
Thus  far,  however,  the  altered  picture  of  inflation  need  not  have  any  sizeable
consequences for monetary policy. It is now too late to influence this year’s path for inflation more than
marginally. Moreover, some of the transitory effects entail a risk of higher inflation, if anything, during
1999; tax cuts and lower interest rates leave households with more money to spend and the same applies
to cheaper oil.
But  underlying  inflation  also  shows  signs  of  being  weaker  than  expected  even  though
economic activity seems to be relatively strong and in line with the paths we have counted on for some
time, with a further increase driven by domestic demand and supported by strong activity in Europe.
The better picture of prices comes from a variety of factors. The rate of wage increases is
likely to be somewhat more advantageous than we counted on earlier, even though we have consistently
been cautiously optimistic in this respect. Of greater importance is productivity, where good growth in
recent  years  has  helped  to  brighten  prospects.  Somewhat  lower  import  prices  together  with  a  slightly
stronger exchange rate also contribute.
Work on our next Inflation Report is nearing completion. There are several indications
that in the two years horizon that is relevant for monetary policy, CPI inflation may be somewhat below
our  target.  The  picture  of  underlying  inflation  is  much  the  same.  Neither  are  these  positive  inflation
prospects modified by the various risks that lie ahead. In a perspective that extends to the middle of 2000
the  element  of  uncertainty  is  obviously  high;  if  anything,  however,  the  main  risk  seems  to  be  that
international activity will be marginally weaker and inflation accordingly somewhat lower.
This is a pleasant situation to be in. The Swedish economy appears to be growing at a
rate  that  is  reasonable  and  broadly  expected.  At  the  same  time,  inflation  is  lower  than  expected.  The
prospect that the Riksbank faced last autumn, of inflation two years hence being half a percentage point
above the target, no longer seems probable.
For  monetary  policy,  the  outlook  has  accordingly  changed.  The  present  inflation
prospects  clearly  imply  that  the  need  to  raise  interest  rates  has  disappeared  for  now.  A  strict
interpretation  of  the  Riksbank’s  rule  that  monetary  policy  is  to  focus  primarily  on  the  second  of  the
coming  two  years  could  even  indicate  some  downward  adjustment  of  the  instrumental  rate.  What  the
BIS Review   47/1998
- 7 -
Riksbank now has reason to consider is whether a minor downward interest rate adjustment would lead
to good conditions for a stable economic development in the future.
4.  Conclusion
Stabilisation  policy  in  Sweden  was  realigned  in  the  early  1990s  and  focused  on  low
inflation.  The  background  was  our  own  and  other  countries’  experience  in  the  1970s  and  1980s.
Repeated attempts to stimulate demand, with a view to boosting employment, and accept the associated
increase in inflation had failed to produce the intended results. On the contrary, economic activity had
become more unstable and growth in the longer term had, if anything, weakened.
In recent years the results of the  policy  realignment  have  been  good  in  many  respects.
Economic  growth  in  Sweden  has  been  higher  than  in  the  latter  part  of  the  1980s  and  it  has  proved
possible  to  combine  this  with  low  inflation.  Government  finances  have  also  undergone  a  rapid
improvement.  Moreover,  revised  rules  for  both  fiscal  and  monetary  policy  have  provided  better
conditions  for  future  stability.  This  means  that  a  good  foundation  has  also  been  established  for  future
economic development.
The 1998 round of settlements agreements represents a step in the right direction in the
sense that, compared with the previous round, the agreed rate of wage increases in coming years looks
like being easier to combine with low inflation. Unfortunately, however, there are still reasons for some
concern  about  the  future.  Do  the  wage  settlements  create  really  good  conditions  for  increased
employment  and  has  a  foundation  been  laid  for  further  responsible  wage  settlements  in  the  next
negotiating round in two to three years time?
Some  positive  things  in  the  Swedish  economy  have  also  happened  in  recent  years  as
regards  competitive  conditions  and  price  formation.  With  the  ongoing  process  of  internationalisation,
European monetary union and advances in the IT field, there is likely to be a further intensification of
competition and downward pressure on prices, to the benefit of Swedish consumers. But there is cause to
consider whether more can be done, which if there is would also assist monetary policy.
Finally I considered aspects of monetary policy and the current situation in this respect.
In the past six months inflation prospects have improved. Like many central banks in central Europe, the
Riksbank  has  accordingly  moved  from  a  situation  that  pointed  to  the  likelihood  of  a  relatively  quick
succession of continued interest rate increases to one where the need of higher interest rates in the near
future seems to have disappeared.
With the bright inflation prospects and a strict interpretation of the Riksbank’s rule for
monetary policy decisions, today there may even be grounds for considering a minor downward repo rate
adjustment. What the Riksbank now has reason to consider is whether such an adjustment would lead to
good conditions for stable economic development in the future.
