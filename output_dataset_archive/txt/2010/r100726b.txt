José De Gregorio: The Monetary Policy Report and the Financial Stability 
Report 
Presentation  by  Mr  José  De  Gregorio,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  before  
the  Finance  Commission  of  the  Honorable  Senate  of  the  Republic,  Santiago  de  Chile, 
16 June 2010. 
 Introduction 
Mr. President of the Finance Commission, Senator Camilo Escalona, senators: 
I am grateful to this Commission for the invitation to the Board of the Central Bank of Chile to 
share our views on recent macroeconomic and financial developments and their implications 
for monetary policy. These are detailed in our Monetary Policy Report (IPoM) of June 2010 
and in our Financial Stability Report (IEF) for the first half of 2010. 
We are presenting our Reports in the midst of a unique scenario for the Central Bank. On the 
one hand, both the Chilean economy and the global economy have been on a sustained path 
of  recovery  since  the  second  half  of  2009.  This  path  has  not  been  free  of  difficulties.  The 
earthquake and tsunami that swept Chile last 27th of February, and which was a major part of 
our  concerns  when  we  visited  this  Commission  in  March,  had  negative  effects  on  the 
February  and  March  output  figures.  As  we  said  in  that  occasion,  those  disruptions  were 
restricted to the short term, as is evident in the strength of the most recent indicators. This 
does mean that the hardest hit areas are in a precariousness situation, especially in housing. 
In  addition,  despite  a  promising  domestic  growth  scenario,  the  Chilean  economy  remains 
operating below full capacity with above normal unemployment levels. This limits inflationary 
pressures,  which  is  consistent  with  maintaining  a  highly  and  exceptionally  expansionary 
monetary policy (figure 1). 
On the other hand, financial stress in Europe is raising the level of uncertainty regarding the 
speed  with  which  the  world  economy  will  recover  and  the  smooth  functioning  of  global 
financial markets. Although the baseline scenario in the two reports we are presenting today 
assumes  that  both  the  world  economy  and  the  Chilean  economy  will  keep  growing  in  the 
coming quarters, the international situation, particularly in Europe, together with its impact on 
our economy and its implications for monetary policy will have to be assessed carefully and 
continually. 
All these elements, which are taken into account in every monthly monetary policy meeting, 
determined that in yesterday’s meeting we began the process of normalizing the significant 
monetary  stimulus  currently  in  place  in  Chile.  This  is  the  natural  step  after  the  gradual 
withdrawal  of  the  extraordinary  facilities  for  liquidity  provision  and  the  term  liquidity  facility 
FLAP, implemented in recent years to deal with the severe effects of the crisis of 2008–2009. 
In the current juncture, it is highly convenient to normalize the monetary stimulus. In the first 
place,  because  the  current  monetary  policy  instance  was  implemented  in  a  context  of 
significant  economic  weaknesses  and  strong  disinflationary  pressures observed  in  the  first 
half  of  last  year.  As  output  gaps  have  begun  to  narrow,  that  dosage  of  stimulus  is  not 
necessary. Secondly, as output gaps close, inflationary pressures will be incubated that will 
need to be contained in time. The level of inflation is currently low, but the problem is neither 
today’s nor the coming months’ inflation figures, but its medium-term trend.  
In that context, as we have stated before, our dilemma is not if we must raise the monetary 
policy rate (MPR), but rather when and by how much to do so. Delaying this process will lead 
to  faster  and  larger  adjustments  along  the  road  to  prevent  the  incubation  of  inflationary 
bubbles. We are aware of the costs of sharp upward adjustments of the interest rate, so it is 
BIS Review 99/2010

necessary  to  time  our  actions  to  ensure  a  gradual  and  timely  normalization  process.  This 
allows withdrawing the monetary stimulus flexibly and in the right dosages. 
The baseline scenario of this IPoM foresees that the normalization of the MPR will proceed 
gradually, but it will remain expansionary for several more quarters. Naturally, the pace and 
magnitude of the normalization will depend on how the uncertain external scenario and the 
domestic macroeconomic conditions unfold, so that the adjustments are consistent with the 
inflation target.  
Both our Financial Stability Report (IEF) and our Monetary Policy Report (IPoM) identify a set 
of  risks  for  the  medium-term  scenario,  to  which  I  will  come  back  in  a  moment.  If  some  of 
them  materialize,  the  Board  will  definitely  revise  and  adjust  its  withdrawal  strategy  for  the 
monetary  stimulus  taking  into  account  their  effects  on  inflation.  As  we  have  shown  in  the 
past,  monetary  policy  has  a  high  capacity  to  adjust  to  changes  in  the  macroeconomic 
scenario.  This  flexibility,  combined  with  a  financial  system  prepared  to  deal  with  risk 
scenarios,  allows  monetary  policy  to  play  a  key  role  in  mitigating  their  impact  of  these 
changes on the national economy. Let me begin by reviewing the most likely scenario for the 
next to years in our view and its implications for inflation and monetary policy.  
Macroeconomic scenario 
To assess the future course of monetary policy, the implications of both external and internal 
developments  have  to  be  taken  into  account.  Worth  singling  out  are  the  reaction  of  local 
financial markets to the external turmoil, the response of the economy to the earthquake and 
tsunami of last February and the trends of output and demand in the coming quarters. 
The world economy has turned more volatile. After several quarters of gradual normalization 
and  relative  financial  calm,  the  international  scenario  presented  significant  tensions  during 
the second quarter of 2010. The weak financial situation in some European countries spread 
to  other  economies  and  banking  systems,  and  at  the  same  time  raised  doubts  about  the 
effectiveness  of  existing  crisis  resolution  mechanisms.  As  underscored  in  the  IEF,  the 
intensity and speed with which these events have occurred reflect the economic and financial 
fragility  that  still  persists  in  advanced  economies  following  the  crisis  of  2008.  In  many  of 
these  countries,  banks’  balance sheets  still  include  deteriorated  assets,  while  facing  major 
refinancing needs for 2010.  
Accordingly,  in  the  past  several  months  we  have  seen  main  stock  indexes  falling 
substantially, interbank spreads rising again and commodities prices falling, with only a few 
exceptions,  including  gold  (figure  2).  Increased  appetite  for  safe  financial  assets  has 
triggered a worldwide reduction in interest rates on this type of instruments, while the dollar 
has  strengthened  and  the  euro  has  depreciated.  The  significant  capital  flows  to  emerging 
economies  have  stabilized  or  reversed  partially, 
flows. 
Nevertheless the preoccupation remains in many emerging economies – especially in Asia – 
about the creation of bubbles in their asset prices. 
As shown in the IEF, the domestic financial market, like those in other emerging economies, 
has  been  fairly  resilient  to  the  instability  in  external  markets,  which  is  visible  in  several 
dimensions. The bulk of the price adjustment has taken place in the foreign exchange and 
stock markets, but even these movements have been comparatively small (figure 3). Unlike 
recent episodes of financial volatility, local monetary markets have operated normally, and 
credit spreads have no risen significant. Chilean sovereign risk premiums have not changed 
much, and local banks have managed to obtain external loans in similar conditions to those 
at  the  end  of  2009.  Recently,  pension  funds  have  reduced  their  assets  abroad,  a 
phenomenon  that  also  occurred  during  the  worst  external  turbulences  at  the  end  of  2008. 
The baseline scenario assumes that this relative resilience will continue over the projection 
horizon.

 BIS Review 99/2010
Despite  the  size  of  the  international  financial  adjustment,  no  evident  effect  has  been 
observed in the global growth projections consensus. On the one hand, the emerging world, 
especially in Asia and Latin America, is showing much faster recovery rates than the main 
industrialized  economies.  On  the  other  hand,  in  the  latter,  manufacturing  output,  sales, 
employment  and  confidence  indicators  do  not  reflect  any  obvious  impact  of  the  global 
financial volatility. Therefore, in the past few months strong effective growth has consolidated 
with notorious differences in the rate of expansion across different economies (figure 4). 
Still,  we  estimate  that  the  higher  volatility  we  see  today  has  been  sufficiently  large  and 
persistent so as to affect world growth projections to some extent. Accordingly, contrary to 
habit, the Board considers as the baseline scenario for global growth in 2011 around half a 
percentage point less than the updated consensus forecast. This responds to the combined 
effects  of  recent  turbulences,  their  persistence  for  some  more  quarters,  and  the  fiscal 
adjustments under way in several economies (table 1). 
Domestically, first-quarter figures suggest that the immediate impact of the earthquake and 
tsunami  on  output  and  demand  differ  from  March  projections.  Whereas  output  initially  fell 
more than expected, largely because of the manufacturing industry, demand tended to rise, 
with significant increases in durable consumption, in imports of consumer and capital goods, 
and  in  retail  sales.  Second-quarter  figures  show  that,  although  the  affected  zones  are  still 
enduring  a  hard  situation,  especially  in  the  housing  conditions  of  affected  areas,  the 
disruptions of the productive process have quickly dissipated (figure 5).  
With respect to firms, our estimates suggest that the effects of the earthquake and tsunami 
on their financial situation was not severe. Estimates of the impact of the catastrophe on their 
payment  capacity  reveal  focalized  effects  on  small  and  medium  firms  of  the  hardest  hit 
regions. Larger firms have relied on insurance that cushion the effects of the earthquake on 
their solvency, but delays in the payment of claims might generate liquidity pressures. 
Accordingly, output will be similar to March projections, while domestic demand will continue 
to  grow  very  strongly.  In  the  baseline  scenario,  the  expansion  of  demand  will  begin  to 
diminish over the course of the second half of this year, mainly because part of its current 
strength is temporary, related to the consumption of durable goods, investment in machinery 
and  equipment  and  inventory  replacement.  The  Board  foresees  that  in  2010  y-o-y  GDP 
growth will between 4% and 5%. This range is slightly lower than March estimates, due to 
slower effective growth in the first quarter. Domestic demand will approach a growth rate of 
15%  in  2010,  determined  by  the  foreseen  increase  in  gross  fixed  capital  formation  and 
private consumption (table 2).

the  progressive 
normalization  of  internal  financial  conditions.  Credit  has  begun  to  present  month-on-month 
increases,  lending  rates  remain  fairly  low  and  the  evaluation  of  both  suppliers  and 
demanders  of  credit  show  less  restrictive  lending  standards  despite  the  earthquake 
(figure 6). As highlighted in the IEF, it is important for the local banking industry to remain 
proactive in keeping and diversifying the sources of external credit and adequately manage 
credit risks within a context of economic recovery. 
Since  mid-2008,  household  borrowing  ratios  and  their  financial  burden  have  decreased. 
Consumer and firm expectations are still near or somewhat above their neutral values. This 
combines  with  the  labor  market  recovering  in  aggregate  terms,  which  overall  was  not 
affected by the earthquake and tsunami.  
Investment  growth  relies  on  both  favorable  macroeconomic  conditions  and  the  boost  of 
reconstruction efforts. As for fiscal policy, the baseline scenario considers that the structural 
balance will be reached towards the end of the current Administration and that there will be 
tax  changes,  budget  reallocations  and  new  financing  sources  for  the  reconstruction, 
according to the government’s announcements.

The  performance  of  output  and  demand  will  result  in  a  current-account  deficit  of  1.2%  of 
GDP this year. Measured at trend prices, this deficit is large by historical standards, but it 
responds partly to temporary reconstruction and replacement expenditures associated with 
the earthquake. 
Year-on-year CPI inflation has continued to rise in recent months, consolidating in positive 
figures.  Core  indicators  for  annual  variations  are  still  in  negative  territory  but  they  steadily 
approach above-zero numbers. Annual inflation figures are somewhat below levels foreseen 
in March. This is because the immediate effects of the earthquake and tsunami, if any, were 
bounded  and  certainly  smaller  than  projected  in  the  last  IPoM  or  by  overall  market 
expectations. Despite this difference, the assumptions about changes in some specific prices 
such as public transport fares, the tobacco excise tax or the unchanged stamp tax will result 
–  in  the  baseline  scenario  –  in  inflation  being  at  the  end  of  2010  in  the  upper  area  of  the 
tolerance range of the inflation target. 
Towards  2011  and  2012,  annual  CPI  inflation  will  oscillate  around  3%  and  will  stay  there 
through the end of the relevant projection horizon, this time the second quarter of 2012. Core 
inflation  will  show  a  slower  convergence  to  3%,  to  hit that  figure  over  the  course of  2011. 
These projections are consistent with June’s Economic Expectations Survey, which foresees 
y-o-y inflation for December of this and next year at 3.5% and 3.2%, respectively, and at 3% 
two years ahead (figure 7). 
Aside  from  the  assumptions  just  described  for  domestic  and  external  growth,  the  baseline 
scenario  considers  that  in  the  long  run  the  real  exchange  rate  (RER)  will  be  similar  to  its 
current level. This, considering that, with the current level of the nominal exchange rate and 
the parities prevailing at the statistical closure of this IPoM, the RER is aligned with its long-
term fundamentals. 
The  domestic  growth  scenario  foreseen  for  the  coming  quarters  assumes  output  gaps 
closing fully during 2011. Today, however, the economy is still operating below full capacity, 
which  limits  inflationary  pressures  and  is  consistent  with  monetary  policy  remaining 
significantly expansionary. Nonetheless, as output gaps close, inflationary pressures will be 
incubated which must be contained in time in order to ensure that annual inflation will stand 
at  3%  over  the  two-year  policy  horizon.  Hence,  the  Board  estimates  that  achieving  the 
inflation  target  in  the  projection  horizon  requires,  as  has  been  said  in  recent  months,  a 
progressive  normalization  of  the  current  significant  monetary  stimulus.  As  a  working 
assumption, the baseline scenario estimates that the level of the MPR one year ahead will be 
similar to the one inferred from private expectations. In the long term, it will converge to its 
neutral level (figure 8). 
As usual, the outlined scenario is subject to several risks. Internally, the greatest risks come 
from  domestic  expenditure.  The  baseline  scenario  considers  that  a  significant  part  of  its 
current strong expansion is temporary. However, there is a risk that said strength is largely 
the response to stimulative macroeconomic conditions, which would mean that the downturn 
foreseen in the second half of this year may not occur, speeding the closing of output gaps. 
The  medium-term  impact  on  aggregate  demand  of  reconstruction  works  and  the  funding 
thereof  will  have  to  be  assessed  continually.  In  the  immediate  term,  April  data  and  the 
reaction  of  economic  sectors  to  the  earthquake  and  tsunami  reduces  the  possibility  of  a 
generalized delay in the economic recovery. 
Internationally, the baseline scenario assumes that the world economic recovery will be more 
gradual  than  suggested  by  average  consensus  estimates.  There  are  risks,  such  as  a 
significant deceleration in the economic activity of the U.S. or China or, as is usual, persistent 
global  imbalances.  However,  the  greatest  source  of  risks  at  this  moment  comes  from 
financial stress, given the remaining by markets regarding whether the fiscal adjustment and 
financial  support  measures  announced  in  Europe  will  be  feasible  and  large  enough.  The 
magnitude  and  reach  of  the  effects  of  a  scenario  in  which  the  weak  fiscal  and/or financial 
4 
 BIS Review 99/2010
situation in Europe intensifies or spreads to other regions materializes, are highly uncertain, 
but potentially substantial. 
Stress  tests  reported  in  the  IEF  show  that  current  levels  of  capitalization  of  the  banking 
industry allow it to absorb the probable consequences of this scenario of increased global 
financial instability. Meanwhile, banks have high levels of liquidity. Despite these strengths, 
banks  must  pay  special  attention  to  the  management  of  their  liquidity  positions  in  foreign 
currencies and take any necessary actions to ensure smooth access to foreign markets. This 
consideration  is  especially  important  due  to  the  fact  that  the  European  commercial  banks 
account  for  a  major  fraction  of  Chilean  banks’  external  financing.  In  addition,  in  the  risk 
scenario, other forms of contagion cannot be ruled out, considering the presence of foreign 
banks  in  Chile.  Certainly,  the  deteriorated  external  financial  conditions  and  the  world 
deceleration that would be created in this risk scenario could have a negative impact on the 
Chilean  economy.  However,  as  it  did  at  the  end  of  2008,  the  Chilean  financial  system  is 
prepared to adequately deal with this tighter external scenario, and the Central Bank has the 
necessary  tools  to  mitigate  these  effects  on  the  liquidity  and  proper  functioning  of  local 
monetary markets.  
The materialization of some of these risks would have direct consequences for the projected 
scenarios  for  national  growth  and  inflation.  After  considering  all  the  above  elements,  the 
Board estimates that the risk balance for output and inflation are unbiased. In any case, as it 
has  done  before,  the  Board  will  adopt  all  measures  necessary  to  address  any  events 
reshaping the macroeconomic scenario and inflationary forecasts. 
Let me share with you some final thoughts before I finish. 
Final thoughts 
In  the  past few  years  we  have  faced  several  external  shocks  that  have  required us  to  act 
flexibly, even changing abruptly the direction of monetary policy. For that we have relied on 
our  policy  system  designed  to  accommodate  to  changes  in  the  economy  within  the 
framework of a price stability objective. 
It is enough to recall that in 2007–2008 we lived through a period of high and very complex 
inflationary  upsurge.  The  causes  were  essentially  external,  aggravated  by  an  unusual 
propagation to other domestic prices. Then, at the end of 2008 and at the beginning of 2009, 
we endured a severe economic downturn and disinflation, also triggered by a foreign event, 
namely the severe global financial crisis and the associated collapse of confidence. In both 
episodes  the  baseline scenario  we  outlined  in the  IPoM  and  IEF  at  the  time  went  through 
unprecedented changes. Most recently, February’s catastrophe made it necessary to adjust 
our projections, particularly for the short term, to include the effects on output of this natural 
disaster.  
As  we  shared  with  you  a  minute  ago,  the  data  for  the  last  quarters  show,  beyond  the 
immediate and medium-term effects of the earthquake, that the economy is growing strongly, 
financial conditions have been steadily normalizing, employment is on the rise and inflation is 
approaching  the  3%  target.  The  most  important  difference  between  now  and  previous 
episodes  during  2007–2009  are  the  fundamentals  behind  our  current  macroeconomic 
scenario.  While  in  earlier  years  the  larger  part  of  inflationary  and  output  fluctuations 
originated  abroad,  today  they  are  related  with  macroeconomic  developments  at  home.  In 
particular,  the  foreseen  closing  of  output  gaps  and  the  current  level  of  the  MPR,  which  is 
highly stimulative compared with several measurements of its neutral level. Thus, monetary 
policy must be applied in consistency with a stronger domestic scenario and in line with the 
inflation target.  
High risks persist internationally. Financial markets around the world and in some European 
countries are raising a red flag. Although not part of the baseline scenario, we cannot rule out 
a worsening of global economic and financial conditions. Overall, the tensions in Europe are

something we had commented in several previous presentations and were related not only 
with the need to put forward expansionary policies to avert further deterioration of output in 
the face of the global crisis, but also with the gradual and orderly withdrawal of fiscal and 
monetary policy stimulus packages in the world.  
What  prevented  the  financial  collapse  of  late  2008  from  becoming  a  second  Great 
Depression were the strong fiscal and monetary stimulus packages around the world. Larger 
fiscal deficits are the outcome of increased expenditure and reduced taxes, in addition to a 
normal deterioration associated with a recessive period. 
Chile  was  able  to  make  an  unprecedented  effort  thanks  to  its  solid  financial  situation  and 
sound  macroeconomic  policies:  the  exchange  rate  adjusted  without  triggering  larger 
imbalances;  the  inflation  targeting  scheme  was  consistent  with  a  drastic  and  significant 
change of sign the monetary policy stance and the conduct of public finances managed to 
implement a highly countercyclical fiscal package that used part of accumulated savings from 
previous years.  
However, not all the economies were in the same position when the crisis hit. The situation 
has been particularly complex for those countries that started this process with fragile fiscal 
situations, that is, with high levels of public debt. Furthermore, in Europe, the existence of a 
common currency has introduced an extra constraint to the adjustment process. 
The foregoing shows how important it is to preserve macroeconomic balances and to act on 
a  timely  basis.  The  latest  events  in  Europe  demonstrate  how  a  weak  fiscal  situation 
combined  with  a  couple  of  years  of  relaxation,  however  warranted,  may  damage  the 
economy’s financial position and compromise its recovery. The fiscal adjustments required in 
Europe,  some  very  drastic  and  with  risky  implications  on  output,  are  living  proof  of  what 
happens when adjustments and the withdrawal of stimulus measures are delayed. Hence the 
importance  of  conducting  this  process  gradually  in  order  to  ensure  a  strong  and 
uninterrupted recovery. 
This  also  applies  to  monetary  policy  in  Chile.  To  the  extent  that  the  withdrawal  of  the 
monetary stimulus is done at a gradual pace, in anticipation to the manifestation of inflation 
deviations, it will be possible to ensure stable and sustained growth of the Chilean economy. 
Any  unnecessary  postponement  of  the  adjustment  will  only  risk  aggravating  the  costs  in 
terms of output and employment in the future. 
Monetary policy played a key role in mitigating the severe effects of the international crisis 
over the last year. It is still playing an important role in this phase of recovery. However, we 
must prevent inflationary pressures from incubating that would jeopardize the achievement of 
the  inflation  target.  Today,  monetary  policy  must  allow  that  the  foundations  for  the 
reconstruction after the earthquake and the recovery from last year’s recession to be strong 
and sustainable, within a context of low, stable inflation. As I have said on several occasions, 
this is the main contribution of the Central Bank of Chile to growth and stability of the Chilean 
economy. 
Thank you very much.
