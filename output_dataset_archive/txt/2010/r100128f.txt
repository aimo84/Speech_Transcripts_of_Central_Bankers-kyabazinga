Lorenzo Bini Smaghi: Reflections on the exit strategy 
Speech by Mr Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central 
Bank, at the Sveriges Riksbank, Stockholm, 21 January 2010. 
 A lot of attention has been devoted in recent policy discussions to the exit strategy from the 
expansionary monetary and fiscal policy stance adopted since the outbreak of the crisis, and 
to the interaction between the two. Designing an optimal exit strategy should, in theory, not 
be too difficult. In an ideal world, fiscal stimuli should be withdrawn before monetary policy is 
tightened in order to ensure that public debt remains sustainable and that monetary policy is 
not overburdened. 
We  know  however  that  first-best  solutions  are  often  hard  to  implement,  because  they  are 
based on unrealistic assumptions relating in particular to the rationality of expectations and 
the  ability  of  policy-makers  to  rapidly  make  decisions  and  to  change  them  if  needed. 
Furthermore,  policy-makers  have  to  take  account  of  the  prevailing  uncertainty  and  of  the 
impact  of  their  decisions  on  agents’  expectations.  For  instance,  fiscal  policy  is  normally 
decided once a year, through an elaborate budget process, but is not implemented until the 
following  year.  This  process  introduces  significant  rigidities  into  the  decision-making  and 
makes  it  somewhat  less  likely  that  fiscal  policy  can  exit  before  monetary  policy,  which  is 
typically a much more flexible instrument. 
Today  I  would  like  to  focus  my  remarks  on  the  exit  from  the  accommodative  stance  of 
monetary  policy.  I  will  not  consider  the  phasing-out  of  the  non-standard  measures  that 
central banks have adopted over the last few months.  
The discussions so far have centred mainly on the timing of the exit decision, which should 
neither be premature nor tardy. There are counter-effects in both scenarios. If the decision to 
exit is made too early, the economic recovery may be put at risk, as higher interest rates will 
produce a tightening effect on consumption and investment decisions at the very time when 
the  pick-up  in  the  economy  is  still  fragile.  Furthermore,  it  might  further  restrict  credit 
conditions while  the  banking  system  is  still  restructuring  its  balance  sheet.  If,  on  the  other 
hand,  the  decision  is  taken  too  late,  monetary  conditions  will  remain  too  lax  for  too  long, 
sowing the seeds of the next crisis. In addition, the later the tightening, the sharper it needs 
to be, thus producing valuation changes that may reduce banks’ profitability and undermine 
their ability to support the economic recovery. 
Given  the  difficulty  of  the  timing,  the  discussion  has  turned  to  the  second-best  option.  In 
other  words,  which  of  the  two  risks  –  being  too  early  or  being  too  late  –  would  pose  the 
biggest  problems  for  the  economy?  Several  authors,  including  international  organisations, 
have suggested that the policy authorities should err on the side of being late. They argue 
that  an  early  tightening  is  difficult  to  reverse  and  tends  to  hit  the  economy  early  in  its 
recovery, and may give rise to a double-dip recession. On the other hand, a late tightening 
allows  more  time  to  bring  things  back  to  normal.  In  addition,  the  stronger  the  economy  is 
likely to be, the more resistant it will be to the shock produced by the tightening of monetary 
conditions. 
Overall, history shows that policy authorities have largely erred on the side of being too late 
than of being too early. Indeed, late exits have been quite numerous; they were either the 
result of deliberate policy decisions to boost the economy, which was probably the case in 
the 1970s and early 1980s, or of forecast errors made in over-estimating deflationary risks

and under-predicting the subsequent recovery, which might be the case of the decade just 
ended.1  
The monetary and fiscal policy tightening that took place in the United States in 1936, which 
led to the 1937–38 recession, is regarded as a text-book example of too early an exit, of a 
mistake  not  to  be  repeated.  There  are  not  many  other  examples  of  early  exits.  The  slight 
increase in interest rates by the Bank of Japan in 2000 has been considered by some as an 
early exit, but recent analysis has downplayed it.2  
In fact, examining closely the 1936 episode in the US, it might not even be considered as an 
early  exit.  The  very  restrictive  monetary  and  fiscal  policies  that  were  adopted  at  that  time 
might deserve to be categorised as a case of “brutal” exit, the effects of which could in fact 
have  occurred  at  any  time,  exit  or  no  exit.  Between  mid-1936  and  early  1937  reserve 
requirements  for  banks  were  doubled  in  a  series  of  three  steps.  The  general  government 
budget  contracted  by  almost  4%  of  GDP.  These  measures  appear  to  have  been 
disproportionate, even with an economy that had started to recover, with inflation picking up 
and credit aggregates accelerating. The severe negative effects of these measures do not 
mean that no measure should have been taken at all. They should simply not have been so 
abrupt and not have taken economic agents by surprise. In other words, the 1936 episode 
might  be  considered  as  an  example  of  a  badly  calibrated  and  badly  communicated  exit, 
rather than a wrongly timed exit.  
In  this  context,  it  is  worth  mentioning  the  1994  episode,  when  the  Fed’s  25-basis-point 
increase  in  its  funds  rate  caused  turmoil  in  the  bond  market.  Even  with  the  benefit  of 
hindsight, that decision can be regarded as neither tardy nor brutal. The problem was that it 
took markets by surprise and led to a major reassessment of the yield curve, with substantial 
valuation losses on long-term positions.  
These  experiences  confirm  that  not  only  is  the  timing  of  the  exit  crucial,  but  also  its 
communication  to  market  participants.  Indeed,  the  impact  of  any  withdrawal  of  monetary 
stimulus on financial market participants depends on whether they have fully anticipated it. If 
they have, then the decision tends to have less impact on the yield curve, and thus on the 
valuation of banks’ assets and on the rate that banks charge to their customers, especially 
on fixed rate loans. As confirmed by a growing body of literature, the main mistake relating to 
the 1936–37 decisions was that they were badly communicated to economic agents.3 
To  sum  up,  a  key  element  of  the  exit  strategy  is  that  the  policy  authorities  must  guide 
expectations. How can they do this?  
Let me first of all consider how it should not be done. 
First, it may be better for central banks not to become embroiled in the debate on whether 
exiting too early or too late is better or worse, and especially not to give signals that the latter 
is  less  risky.  Such  an  approach  could  encourage  market  participants  to  become  less  risk-
averse  and  to  expect  the  period  of  low  interest  rates  to  be  extended  beyond  what  is 
necessary. This would induce them to take on further risks, in particular in terms of maturity 
mismatches – borrowing short-term to buy long-term bonds – which might be profitable in the 
short term but could lead to substantial capital losses when the exit takes place.

Second, any commitment to prolonged periods of low interest rates is risky. If the aim is to 
lower  long-term  rates,  it  may  also  encourage  market  participants  to  take  substantial  long 
positions in the fixed income market. As a result, the risk of major losses arising at the time 
of  the  exit  increases  considerably,  as  the  1994  experience  shows.  This  may  induce  the 
central  bank  to  further  delay  the  exit  to  avoid  penalising  banks.  This  seems  to  be  the 
experience of 2002–2004. As a result, interest rates may remain below the desired level for 
too long, fuelling a possible bubble. 
Third, central banks need to be very careful in using information extracted from market data 
when conducting monetary policy. The anchoring of inflation expectations is a very important 
benchmark  for  assessing  whether  the  stance  of  monetary  policy  has  become  too 
expansionary and whether there are risks of falling behind the curve. However, the pre-crisis 
period and the crisis itself have shown that expectations are not always formed in a rational 
way and might themselves be influenced by the behaviour of the monetary authorities. Quite 
often markets participants form their expectations by looking at central banks’ behaviour, on 
the assumption that the latter have better and more information about underlying inflationary 
pressures.  Under  these  circumstances,  market-based  inflation  forecasts  tend  to  be  biased 
and  may  react  in  a  perverse  way  following  a  tightening  of  monetary  policy.  In  particular, 
inflation expectations may be revised up, rather than down, after an interest rate increase, 
especially at the beginning of a tightening cycle. If the monetary authorities’ assumption that 
inflation  expectations  are  well  anchored  proves  to  be  wrong,  the  whole  yield  curve  might 
move upwards and the decision to increase the rate of interest may result in a much sharper 
tightening than expected.4 
Another  problem  with  inflation  expectations  concerns  their  measurement,  especially  in 
periods  of  financial  turbulence,  when  the  liquidity  of  the  underlying  instruments  can  affect 
their signalling content. A further distortion may arise when the central bank is itself a major 
buyer and holder of indexed-linked assets, which may distort prices and thus the information 
content.  Measurement  problems  arise  also  with  other  components  of  the  analytical 
framework, such as the output gap. Experience shows that measurement of the output gap 
varies over time. For instance, when measured ex post, with the data available until 2008, 
the US output gap over the period 2002–2004 turned out to be very small, even non-existent, 
while ex ante it was estimated at around 2% of GDP.5  
So  what  should  a  central  bank  do  to  implement  and  communicate  an  appropriate  exit 
strategy? Let me make a few comments on this. 
To  ensure  that  the  exit  strategy  does  not  come  as  a  complete  surprise,  it  has  to  be  well 
communicated. Over recent months, central banks have devoted a lot of time to explaining 
their exit strategies, both in terms of content and conditions. At the ECB we have made it 
clear that, as in the past, any decision – even one concerning the exit – will be linked to the 
underlying  economic  conditions  and  in  particular  to  the  re-emergence  of  inflationary 
pressures. Market participants should thus form their expectations on future interest rates on 
the  basis  of  projected  economic  developments  rather  than  on  specific  unconditional 
commitments.  
In  order  to  promote  understanding  of  how  monetary  policy  needs  to  adapt  to  changing 
economic conditions, and eventually exit from its very accommodative stance, central banks 
would do well to explain how the stance itself is affected not only by the level of the interest 
rate  they  control,  but  also  by  the  underlying  economic  developments,  such  as  projected 
growth  and  inflation.  In  this  respect,  it  is  interesting  to  note  that  over  the  last  six  months, 
while economic activity and inflation have picked up, interest rates, both in nominal and real

terms,  have  continued  to  fall.  Spreads  on  different  types  of  bond,  except  those  of  some 
governments,  have  continued  to  come  down.  The  slope  of  the  yield  curve  has  slightly 
increased, in particular in the US (see Annex). 
Finally, an exit is more easily communicated, and understood, by market participants if it is 
gradual. Any interest rate adjustment – even a slight one – entails some form of discontinuity, 
which  may  affect  the  whole  yield  curve.  A  credible  gradual  exit,  if  well  communicated, 
minimises  shocks  to  interest  rate  expectations.  However,  a  gradual  exit  strategy  is  more 
likely to be credible if it is implemented in a timely way. If it gives the appearance of being 
late, the first step by the central bank is likely to cause a substantial revision of interest rate 
expectations and thus of the yield curve, strengthening the impact of the tightening. 
To sum up, experience suggests that what matters most in any exit strategy is that markets 
are  well  prepared,  so  that  when  the  decision  is  ultimately  made  they  are  not  taken  by 
surprise and suffer negative repercussions. Communicating an exit strategy is, in  the end, 
not  that  different  from  communicating  monetary  policy  in  normal  times.  Given  the  state  of 
uncertainty about the recovery, market participants have to base their expectations, and their 
trading  decisions,  on  projected  economic  fundamentals  rather  than  trying  to  read  between 
the lines of policy announcements.
