Mugur Isărescu: External deficit financing and macroeconomic 
adjustment during the financial crisis – the case of Romania 
Dissertation  by  Mr  Mugur  Isărescu,  Governor  of  the  National  Bank  of  Romania,  on  the 
occasion  of  being  admitted  to  the  Reial  Acadèmia  de  Doctors,  Barcelona,  24 November 
2009. 
 Introduction 
The  issue  of  the  financing-adjustment  relation  can  be  best  described  starting  from  the 
corporate level. Here, an adjustment programme may attract financing only if the envisaged 
changes are trustworthy. Corporations may raise the funds necessary to fulfil the new goals 
via capital increases made by owners, via taking out new bank loans or selling newly-issued 
corporate bonds to the public.  
At  macroeconomic  level  things  are  much  the  same,  but  instead  of  a  company’s  balance 
sheet, we speak about a country’s balance of payments with its two accounts, i.e. the capital 
account and the current account. These accounts register the continuous changes reflecting 
the country’s foreign transactions. The direction of such changes may differ from one year to 
another.  For  this  reason,  not  any  change  in  the  equilibrium  of  the  two  accounts  may  be 
defined as an adjustment. In order to describe an adjustment in the balance of payments, the 
key concepts are the improvement or the worsening in the balance of either account.  
The improvement concept may apply, separately, both to the current account and the capital 
account. According to economic literature, a reversal in the current account occurs if, at the 
same  time,  the  change  in  the  balance  is  large  relative  to  nominal  gross  domestic  product 
(GDP)  and  lasts  for  more  than  one  year  (Milesi-Ferretti  and  Razin,  2000).  Thus,  an 
improvement in the current account occurs if, for several years, the current account deficit 
narrows  significantly  both  in  relative  and  absolute  terms.  An  improvement  in  the  capital 
account  is  indicative  of  substantial  capital  inflows.  Since  massive  capital  inflows  are  also 
associated  with  troubles,  including  a  sizeable  appreciation  of  the  exchange  rate,  an 
improvement in the capital account is also referred to as “the capital inflows problem” (Calvo, 
Leiderman, Reinhart, 1993). 
Conversely, a worsening of the current account is reflected by the twin deficits or by relatively 
wide  deficits.  Furthermore,  a  worsening  of  the  capital  account  reflects  the  sudden  stop  in 
capital inflows, or even net outflows of capital. A sudden stop is defined as a sufficiently large 
reversal in capital inflows compared to the average for the previous years, accompanied by a 
noticeable upsurge in capital cost (Calvo, Izquierdo and Mejia, 2004, and Calvo, Izquierdo 
and Loo-Kung, 2006). 
The difference between quasi-individual adjustments and global adjustments in the balance 
of payments is useful in drafting economic policies. Quasi-individual adjustments emerge in 
cases  where,  due  to  specific  conditions,  one  country  alone  faces  relatively  heavy  capital 
inflows over a certain period, followed by a decrease in such inflows. Global adjustments are 
characterised by synchronous, large capital inflows in a great number of countries, followed 
by their relative reduction for the entire group. Usually, the number of countries facing large 
capital inflows simultaneously is relatively small. However, from time to time, simultaneous 
episodes of massive capital inflows occur in a relatively great deal of countries. Over the past 
few  years,  very  many  countries,  Romania  included,  were  faced  with  the  capital  inflows 
problem. For this reason, I will refer to synchronous, large capital inflows. 
As  recently  pointed  out  by  Reinhart  and  Reinhart  (2008),  there  may  be  a  relationship 
between these synchronous, large capital inflows and external sovereign defaults, currency 
crashes, inflation crises and banking crises. The authors defined the crises for each of the 
BIS Review 5/2010 
 1
above-mentioned components and constructed specific probabilities of crisis emergence for 
the 1960–2007 period in 66 countries. The probabilities were defined both conditional and 
unconditional on the episodes of heavy capital inflows. The final outcome is that, for low- or 
middle-income countries, the conditional probabilities for a crisis to emerge are significantly 
higher than unconditional ones. 
In other words, the number of crises is higher around the episodes of large capital inflows. 
One  may  conclude,  in  practice,  the  ensuing  magnitude  of  adjustments  and  financings  is 
different from that seen in quasi-individual episodes of substantial capital inflows for a given 
period, followed by their reduction. This owes to the fact that, if synchronised crises occur in 
any of the cited components – sovereign debt, exchange rate, inflation and banking system – 
synchronised  recession  episodes  are  likely  to  follow.  Certainly,  simultaneous  resorting  to 
external financing with a view to underpinning a great many anti-crisis programmes makes 
the resources to each country relatively less available and costlier than in the case where 
only a small number of countries use a given amount of resources. In addition, synchronised 
recession  episodes  could  translate  into  greater  individual  recessions  for  the  economies  in 
which the export-oriented sector holds a sizeable share in GDP.  
Against  this  background,  the  difficulty  in  adopting  a  package  of  reforms  and  in  securing 
external funding is bigger in the context of the quasi-singular episodes when a large capital 
inflow  cycle  ends.  Romania  took  this  into  account  at  the  time  of  asking  for  financial 
assistance  from  the  EU,  the  IMF  and  other  international  financial  institutions  to  cover  the 
financing  gap  estimated  for  2009  and  2010.  I  will  get  back  to  this  topic  in  the  concluding 
section of the paper.  
The modern age of global finance saw several episodes of such synchronous, heavy capital 
inflows. In principle, once in a while, foreign investors find enough reasons to invest relatively 
large amounts of capital in emerging economies. Considering the time period that elapsed 
after World War I, one may assert that the pattern failed to repeat itself in the ’30s, the ’40s 
and the ’50s.  
The longest cycle of synchronous, massive capital inflows lasted from 1975 to 1982 and was 
followed  by  the  debt  crisis.  The  heavy  capital  inflows  resurfaced  during  the  1990–1993 
period and were followed by debt restructuring in the emerging economies. Starting in 2002, 
a large number of countries were faced with massive capital inflows. The end of the capital 
flow  bonanza  overlapped  the  onset  of  the  financial  turmoil  in  July  2007.  In  Romania,  this 
episode became more manifest in 2004 and came to an end in 2008.  
Next,  I  will  elaborate  on  the  causes  generating  synchronous,  massive  capital  inflows  in  a 
relatively great number of countries and the key developments emerging when the countries 
are faced with heavy capital inflows. In so doing, I will show the stylised facts, as they can be 
elicited from literature (Calvo et al., 1993). Then I will describe the case of Romania and the 
major  challenges  to  economic  policies.  Finally,  I  will  resort  to  the  results  described  in  the 
literature to present in a stylised manner the implications on some macroeconomic variables 
in  the  event  of  a  capital  account  worsening.  I  will  draw  on  these  results  to  show  that  the 
provisions under the arrangement signed with the EU and the IMF are in line with the results 
described in the literature.  
Causes and effects of massive capital inflows 
1. 
In  recent  years,  one  of  the  causes of  massive  capital  inflows  in  emerging  economies  was 
excess liquidity. The liquidity surplus in developed economies caused the persistence of low 
interest rates and the reduction in volatility on financial markets. Moreover, despite excess 
liquidity,  economic  growth  in  advanced  countries  slowed  down  in  recent  years,  the 
profitability in several industries dropping to relatively low levels. 
In  this  context,  investors  started  the  search  for  yield  and  profit  opportunities  in  emerging 
economies. In such cases, interest rates acted via the portfolio channel (Calvo, Leiderman 
2 
 BIS Review 5/2010
and  Reinhart,  1993).  In  addition,  low  interest  rates  and  portfolio  diversification  led  to  the 
improvement in debt default probabilities in emerging countries, implying the activation of the 
channel  suggested  by  Dooley  et  al.  (1996).  Gradually,  investors  were  no  longer  wary  of 
emerging  economies  so  that  large  capital  inflows  were  further  recorded  for  several  years. 
Reinhart  and  Reinhart  (2008)  showed  that,  during  1980–2008,  the  maximum  period  of 
massive  capital  inflows  in  181  countries  was  of  3  years  for  more  than  50  countries  and 
4 years for more than 30 countries. Nevertheless, in almost 20 countries that period lasted 
5 years.  
This does not necessarily imply that large capital inflows were recorded solely by emerging 
economies.  They  were  relatively  large  in  low-income  countries,  as  well  as  in  middle-  and 
high-income countries, OECD members. For instance, capital inflows were relatively high in 
the US (2002–2007), in the United Kingdom and France (2005–2007), in Spain (2004–2007). 
In Romania, large capital inflows were recorded during 2004–2008. 
The favourable economic outlook associated with the accession to an economic union was 
another  major  cause  for  synchronous  capital  inflows  in  several  countries.  It  is  the  case  of 
countries joining the European Union or NAFTA. Foreign investors acted on the assumption 
that the accession to a union is an anchor limiting exchange rate fluctuations, cutting capital 
costs  by  lowering  risk  spreads  and  maintaining  share  prices  at  satisfactory  levels.  Milesi-
Ferretti  and  Lane  (2006)  provided  a  breakdown  of  sources  of  massive  capital  inflows  in 
Central  and  Eastern  European  (CEE)  countries.  The  euro  area  countries  provided 
73-95 percent  of  total  foreign  direct  investment  in  CEE  countries.  In  2004,  in  most  CEE 
countries,  more  than  50  percent  of  total  portfolio  investment  on  the  stock  exchange  came 
from the euro area, which was also the main source of foreign assets in the banking systems 
of CEE countries as well as of debt-creating long-term investment. 
The rise in prices of goods such as crude oil, copper, diamonds, a. o. (“hard” commodities) 
fostered  capital  inflows  in  countries  exporting  the  aforementioned  goods.  Where  capital 
inflows in countries exporting such commodities are due to low or negative real interest rates 
in the countries of origin of capital, then the prices for such goods come under the impact of 
the  interest  rate  channel  (Frankel,  2006).  Nevertheless,  the  empirical  assessments  of 
Reinhart  and  Reinhart  (2008)  covering  the  1967–2006  period  do  not  clearly  confirm  the 
reverse  correlation  between  real  interest  rates  and  the  prices  for  the  above-mentioned 
commodities.  
Large capital inflows had similar effects in emerging economies. A stylised assumption refers 
to a common pattern for developments in some variables and a relatively similar response 
model  of  economic  policies.  Hence,  relatively  large  capital  flows  entered  rather  small  and 
shallow markets. The discrepancy between the financial depth of emerging economies and 
the volume of capital inflows led to currency appreciation, fast growth of asset prices and the 
rise in prices for “hard” commodities. The favourable price changes entailed further increases 
in  capital  inflows,  which  caused  these  growth  rates  to  continue  for  relatively  long  periods. 
Favourable price developments led to the improvement in fiscal indicators and the reduction 
in the cost of foreign currency credit, thus fostering lending. The fast expansion of lending 
caused  the  widening  of  the  structural  weaknesses  of  the  banking  system,  which  became 
dependent on foreign capital inflows.  
In  terms  of  policies,  the  authorities’  response  focused  on  several  common  areas,  such  as 
reserve purchase in order to prevent excessive appreciation. This process was more visible 
in  the  countries  exporting  energy  resources.  Another  area,  closely  linked  to  the  first  one, 
envisaged the rise in required reserves, the levying of taxes on financial transactions, other 
administrative  restrictions  in  order  to  alleviate  capital  inflows  and  reserve  accumulation. 
Moreover, 
for  structural 
adjustments, which were postponed. This was probably the most important implication for the 
respective  economies  since,  in  the  long  run,  the  delay  in  structural  adjustments  has  a 
negative impact on external competitiveness.

Developments after the end of large capital inflow episodes – stylised facts 
2. 
It goes without saying that each country has its own particular features and this is why each 
current  account  reversal,  each  episode  of  massive  capital  inflows,  each  sudden  stop  in 
capital inflows and each financial crisis has particular features. However, they do have some 
things in common, irrespective of the country or the period of occurrence. We show particular 
interest in such common features in terms of the dynamics of selected indicators, such as 
GDP, real exchange rate, inflation and current account both before and after the end of an 
episode  of  large  capital  inflows.  Certain  patterns  relating  to  the  dynamics  of  the 
aforementioned indicators can be identified based on the results described in the literature, 
the  latest  ones  belonging  to  Reinhart  and  Reinhart  (2008).  Since  the  pattern  of  these 
dynamics during the episode of heavy capital inflows has been described both in general and 
in the particular case of Romania, the focus will be on a matter of utmost interest these days, 
namely the likely trajectory of the abovementioned indicators after the cycle of large capital 
inflows  ends.  Following  the  methodology  of  various  other  works,  Figure  I  sets  out  the 
developments in current account, GDP, exchange rate and inflation in a stylised manner four 
years ahead and four years after the end of the episode of large capital inflows.  
Chart 1 in Figure I depicts the evolution of the current account deficit prior to the end of the 
episode  of  sizeable  capital  inflows  (“0”  on  the  horizontal  axis).  This  depiction  reflects  the 
identity  typical  of  the  balance  of  payments,  namely  that  the  current  account  deteriorates 
during the episode of massive capital inflows. At the same time, the end of the episode of 
heavy  capital  inflows  overlaps  the  initiation  of  current  account  adjustment  towards  levels 
seen in the run-up to the reversal. The V-shaped pattern of current account developments is 
sharper in low- and middle-income countries (Reinhart and Reinhart, 2008).  
In line with expectations, real GDP growth is relatively high during a capital flow bonanza and 
is followed by a sudden drop in the year when the episode ends and a relatively fast recovery 
thereafter. In other words, subsequent to the end of the cycle of heavy capital inflows, the 
GDP trajectory is V-shaped, as illustrated in Chart 2, Figure I.  
The attempt at identifying a pattern on how inflation fared was the most difficult, because the 
data  presented  in  the  literature  vary  to  a  great extent,  which  could be an  indication  of  the 
major role played by monetary policy both before and after the large capital inflows. I tend to 
believe that the end of the cycle of heavy capital inflows is followed by a short-term bout of 
inflation (basically on account of the exchange rate channel), while the subsequent decline in 
inflation is triggered by the recession and the downbeat expectations that are typical of the 
periods  following  capital  flow  bonanzas.  This  view  may  be  explained  by  a  relatively  large 
nominal depreciation. However, over the following years, inflation reverts to levels more or 
less similar to those seen prior to the stop in the heavy capital inflow episode. The stylised 
profile is depicted in Chart 3, Figure I.  
Chart  4,  Figure  I  sets  out  the  stylised  trajectory  of  the  exchange  rate.  If  massive  capital 
inflows  span  over  several  years,  the  real  appreciation  on  an  annual  basis  tends  to  be 
significant,  so  that  the  cumulated  appreciation  is  also  significant,  leading  to  the  downward 
path in the chart. Nevertheless, the end of the episode of large capital inflows results in a 
cumulated  real  depreciation  even  higher  than  the  cumulated  appreciation.  The  literature 
shows that in most cases real depreciation becomes manifest via a nominal depreciation of 
the currency. In the stylised trajectory shown in Chart 4, Figure I, real depreciation is driven 
by the drop in prices no earlier than the first year after the end of the episode.

 Charts  1–4  in  Figure  I  allow  an  overall  view  of  what  can  be  expected  in  terms  of  the 
developments  in  the  aforementioned  indicators  after  the  episode  of  large  capital  inflows 
comes  to  an  end.  They  are  an  indication  of  which  curve  profile  cannot  be  precluded  by  a 
country after an episode of large capital inflows draws to an end. However, while the curve 
profiles are similar for most countries, the curve slopes both before and after the end of an 
episode  of  large  capital  inflows  may  be  sharper  or  less  sharp.  It  is  up  to  policy-makers  to 
draft policy measures during such an episode in order to influence both the level  where a 
U-turn occurs and the slopes following the end of an episode of sizeable capital inflows. I will 
show in the following section that the policies envisaged by the arrangement Romania signed 
with the EU and the IMF are aimed at smoothing out the slope of the trends of the above-
mentioned  indicators  so  that  the  necessary  adjustments  unwind  at  a  reasonable  pace, 
without destabilising the economy.

Case study – Romania  
The period of massive capital inflows 
3.1. 
Foreign capital inflows in Romania have picked up since 2004. The current account deficit 
widened  from  8.4  percent  of  GDP  in  2004  to  13.5  percent  of  GDP  in  2007  and  to 
12.3 percent of GDP in 2008. The medium- and long-term external debt of the private sector 
posted  an  almost  twofold  increase  (Chart  1),  from  12.9  percent  of  GDP  in  2004  to 
25.6 percent of GDP in 2008.

 In  2004,  the  Romanian  economy  had  little  financial  depth  (measured  as  a  ratio  of  M3  to 
GDP)  of  only  25.6  percent.  The  financial  depth  increased  on  the  back  of  massive  capital 
inflows, yet it remains relatively low by advanced economy standards (34.5 percent of GDP 
in 2008). Given the relatively little financial depth, the effects of capital inflows emerged fast 
and were significant (Chart 2).

 The  exchange  rate  appreciated  in  both  real  and  nominal  terms.  The  domestic  currency 
appreciated in nominal terms from nearly RON/EUR 4.1 in January 2004 to RON/EUR 3.1 in 
July  2007  (about  24  percent).  Along  with  the  relatively  high  fiscal  dominance  and  the  net 
debtor  position  of  the  National  Bank  of  Romania  (NBR),  heavy  capital  inflows  became  a 
serious matter of concern in terms of implementing inflation targeting, i.e. the new monetary 
policy  strategy  adopted  in  August  2005.  While  boosting  disinflation,  the  domestic  currency 
appreciation was so strong that it tended to affect the external competitiveness of Romania. 
To this added the episodes of high volatility on the foreign exchange market. 
As in other CEE countries, foreign banks operating in Romania took funds from their euro 
area  parent-banks.  In  2004,  nearly  72  percent  of  liabilities  came  from  the  euro  area  and 
21 percent  from  the  United  Kingdom.  During  2004–2008,  foreign  liabilities  of  the  banks  in 
Romania increased more than six times, from EUR 3.8 billion to EUR 24.5 billion. Such rises 
were reported across the entire maturity spectrum.  
The surge in banks’ foreign currency holdings and the appreciation of the domestic currency 
acted  jointly  towards  boosting  lending  in  foreign  currency.  Loans  expanded  for  several 
successive years at annual growth rates ranging from 60 percent to 80 percent in real terms. 
The share of foreign currency-denominated loans to households grew more than five times, 
from 2.2 percent of GDP in December 2004 to 11.6 percent of GDP in 2008. Moreover, the 
share of foreign currency-denominated loans to the corporate sector picked up substantially 
(Chart 3). Overall, financial intermediation (loans to the private sector/GDP) increased from 
16.6 percent in 2004 to 39.3 percent in 2008 (Chart 4).

 Banks  came  to  rely  heavily  on  external  financing,  while  the  mismatch  between  foreign 
currency-denominated  assets  and  forex  liabilities  of  both  companies  and  households 
widened.  In  2004,  the  difference  between  forex-denominated  deposits  and  loans  in  the 
corporate  sector  stood  at  around  lei  –5  billion,  increasing  sevenfold  by  March  2009,  i.e.  
lei –34 billion.  As  for  households,  the  differences  stood  at  lei  +5  billion  and  lei  –28  billion 
respectively (Chart 6). These imbalances stand out as one of the most serious vulnerabilities 
faced by the domestic economy, as they are the main channels whereby the potential halt in 
external financing feeds through into exchange rate depreciation.

These  developments  reinforced  each  other,  so  that  during  2005–2007  there  were  periods 
when inflation expectations coexisted with a markedly stronger domestic currency. Under the 
circumstances,  the  central  bank  was  faced  with  a  serious  dilemma  in  terms  of  the  newly-
adopted monetary policy regime. Policy rate hikes, required for bringing expectations in line 
with the inflation target, attracted further foreign capital, which entailed the appreciation of the 
leu.  
Along with policy rate changes given the coexistence of upward pressures on the domestic 
currency  and  inflationary  pressures,  the  central  bank  also  increased  required  reserves  in 
order  to  dampen  capital  inflows.  Required  reserves  for  foreign  currency-denominated 
liabilities were gradually raised from 20 percent at the onset of 2002 to 40 percent in early 
2006 (Chart 7). The measure failed to deter capital inflows, which managed to find ways of 
circumventing  the  restriction.  Despite  higher  required  reserves,  commercial  banks’ foreign-
currency-denominated  liabilities  advanced  EUR  4.8  billion  in  2006,  then  EUR  7.8  billion  in 
2007  and  a  further  EUR  5.8  billion  in  2008.  Nearly  75  percent  of  the  increase  in  foreign 
banks’  liabilities  during  2005–2008  occurred  after  required  reserves  had  been  raised  to 
40 percent.

 The constraint deriving from the large capital inflows was severe enough for the NBR to opt 
for  maintaining  a  managed  float  regime  of  the  domestic  currency.  This  led  to  criticism  by 
some analysts who claimed that the inflation targeting strategy adopted in 2005 involved the 
free float of the domestic currency in order to avoid potentially conflicting targets. The NBR 
explained  that  it  would  not  target  a  particular  exchange  rate,  but  rather  seek  to  deter  its 
movements towards unsustainable levels. Consequently, during 2005–2008 the NBR did not 
refrain from making discreet forex market interventions by purchasing considerable amounts 
of foreign currency so as to preclude the fast overappreciation of the leu, which was likely to 
cause  a  dangerous  erosion  of  the  Romanian  economy’s  external  competitiveness  and  to 
lead to a fall in inflation, yet in an unsustainable manner. 
At this juncture, I should bring to the fore other arguments in favour of a managed float policy 
for  the  Romanian  currency.  The  major  reason  underlying  the  NBR’s  purchases  of  foreign 
10 
 BIS Review 5/2010
currency  consisted  in  the  fact  that  the  leu  strengthened  in  both  nominal  and  real  terms, 
concurrently  with  an  extremely  loose  wage  policy  in  2006  and  especially  in  2007.  During 
those years, pay rises overtook productivity gains, thus reducing the previously accumulated 
competitiveness  gains  and  contributing  definitely  to  the  worsening  of  the  balance  of 
payments current account.  
Another  argument  I  would  like  to  point  out  is  of  a  precautionary  nature.  As  it  has  been 
noticed  in  practice,  the  end  of  cycles  of  synchronous  large  capital  inflows  coincide  with 
somewhat abrupt depreciation episodes, which can be avoided provided sufficient reserves 
are available.  
The pro-cyclical conduct of fiscal policy that added to the vulnerabilities associated with the 
widening  of  the  current  account  deficit  during  2004–2008  also  underpinned  the  NBR’s 
purchases of foreign currency. In principle, fiscal policy may either cushion or magnify the 
undesired  effects  of  large  capital  inflows.  Such  effects  are  intensified  because  the  cyclical 
components of GDP, large net capital inflows and higher budget outlays in real terms boost 
one another. From this perspective, but also judging by the fact that large capital inflows are 
associated  with  financial  crises,  Romania  opted  for  an  imprudent  fiscal  policy  during  
2004–2008.  There  were  two  reasons  for  this  and  both  are  fully  explained  in  the  literature. 
The  first  reason  was  that  policymakers  believed  “good  times”  would  be  permanent,  which 
obviously  meant  that  the  spending  spree  could  last  forever.  The  second  reason  relates  to 
2008 being an election year, which pushed up budget expenditures further. The loose fiscal 
policy laid the groundwork for an involuntary fiscal contraction in the event of an economic 
downturn.  
Next, I will now focus on the pattern displayed by developments in certain indicators once the 
episode of large capital inflows has ended.  
Macroeconomic adjustment following the end of large capital inflow episodes 
3.2. 
The  slope  curve,  which  illustrates  adjustments,  relies  directly  on  foreign  investors’ 
expectations  and  decisions  relative  to  macroeconomic  and  structural  policies.  In  2008,  the 
global financial crisis induced a general lack of trust and fuelled markedly investor aversion 
to risk. Romania has become a risky destination for investors due to the size of its current 
account  deficit,  banks’  hinging  on  external  financing,  the  relatively  large  foreign  borrowing 
requirements and the high ratio of foreign currency-denominated loans to foreign currency-
denominated deposits. Estimations showed that Romania’s deficit financing for 2009 could 
have ranged between EUR 7.5 billion and EUR 16 billion, dependent upon foreign investors’ 
sentiment  and  their  willingness  to  roll  over  the  credit  lines  extended  to  banks  and  private 
companies. This gloomy sentiment was reflected in the weakening of the leu during October 
2008  –  February  2009.  In  this  context,  the  authorities  have  decided  to  implement  policies 
aimed at ensuring minimum cuts in Romania’s foreign financing. 
As early as December 2008, the economic programme was envisaged to focus on narrowing 
the  external  deficit  of  both  public  and  private  sectors,  containing  the  impact  of  recession, 
averting  a  currency  crisis  as  well  as  on  easing  inflationary  pressures.  Attaining  these 
objectives required the design of adjustment measures meant to bring the economy onto a 
sustainable path with minimal losses, including in terms of employment.  
Given  the  sudden  stop  of  the  massive  capital  inflow  episode,  the  leu’s  exchange  rate 
developments  posed  serious  challenges.  While  in  the  past  foreign  currency  inflows 
generated  the  overappreciation  of  the  leu  well above  the  level  indicated  by  exchange  rate 
fundamentals,  the  reduction  in  external  financing  and  the  degree  of  uncertainty  tended  to 
result in the unwarranted depreciation of the leu. 
The  challenges  were  all  the  more  so  great  that,  despite  the  heavy  foreign  currency 
purchases  performed  during  2005–2007, 
the 
unsustainable  appreciation  of  the  leu,  instead  of  completely  avoiding  it.  Moreover,

foreign-currency-denominated loans (Chart 6) posted a fast-paced growth and any rapid and 
excessive  depreciation  of  the  domestic  currency  would  have  generated  negative  chain 
reactions  across  the  banking  system.  Hence,  the  central  bank’s  policy  on  forex  market 
intervention  was  further  steered  in  this  new  environment  by  the  philosophy  that  a  high 
volatility of the exchange rate is detrimental to the inflation target as well as to the financial 
soundness  of  the  real  and  financial  sectors.  A  small  emerging  economy  with  a  significant 
openness  is  exposed  on  an  ongoing  basis  to  the  threat  of  capital  movements  likely  to 
adversely  affect  the  stability  of  the  financial  market,  the  foreign  exchange  market  in 
particular. 
Firstly,  the  NBR’s  interventions  in  the  foreign  exchange  market  were  meant  to  avoid  an 
excessive weakening of the domestic currency, while also linking the level and the pace of 
the depreciation to the progress in the current account adjustment. With this goal in mind, the 
central bank monitored the developments in the real effective exchange rate of the domestic 
currency,  along  with  the  pressures  on  external  competitiveness  stemming  from  wage 
bargaining.  
Secondly, foreign exchange market interventions were calibrated in line with developments in 
foreign currency reserves. The foreign currency reserves resulting from market interventions 
during the overappreciation period, to which added the funds received under the financing 
arrangement  concluded  with  the  IMF,  the  EU  and  other  international  financial  institutions, 
enabled  the  central  bank  to  support  the  domestic  currency;  despite  these  interventions, 
official  reserves  stood  constantly  at  safety  level.  The  central  bank  monitors  not  only  the 
absolute value of forex reserves, but also the derived indicators: foreign currency reserves 
expressed  in  months  of  imports  of  goods  and  services  and  the  ratio  of  forex  reserves  to 
short-term debt remained unchanged or improved (Chart 8).

 Thirdly,  the  magnitude  and  the  timing  of  forex  market  interventions  were  also  related  to 
money  market  liquidity  management,  given  that  public  deficit  was  financed,  over  certain 
periods, by resorting chiefly to the funds released under the arrangement signed with the EU, 
the IMF and other international financial institutions. The NBR provided banks with liquidity 
12 
 BIS Review 5/2010
by way of open-market operations (Chart 9), while in the prior years, amid excess liquidity 
due to massive capital inflows, the central bank held the position of a net debtor position vis-
à-vis the banking system. The rationale behind the forex market intervention in the above-
mentioned  context  was  the  attempt  to  fend  off  temporary  reversals  in  the  NBR’s  creditor 
position  vis-à-vis  the  banking  system,  which  could  have  jeopardised  the  monetary  policy 
transmission mechanism.

 Therefore, it may be asserted that foreign exchange market interventions proved useful not 
only  in  keeping  the  exchange  rate  within  a  range  consistent  with  macroeconomic 
fundamentals, but also in ensuring optimal money market liquidity management. 
The National Bank of Romania was not the only central bank to opt for the managed float of 
the domestic currency. As regards forex market intervention as part of the instrument array 
used  by  central  banks  all  over  the  world,  it  is  noteworthy  that  the  relevance  of  this  tool 
increased  after  the  onset  of  the  financial  turmoil.  Central  banks  in  Central  and  Eastern 
European countries that have in place a flexible exchange rate system (the Czech Republic, 
Poland,  Romania  and  Hungary)  issued  in  February  2009  a  joint  statement  whereby  they 
openly  declared  themselves  against  an  excessive  depreciation  of  local  currencies  which 
could not be substantiated by economic fundamentals and could produce a destabilisation, 
committing  themselves  to  move  towards  fighting  such  a  depreciation.  The  exchange  rate 
developments of the said countries’ currencies are presented in Figure II.  
While  the  relatively  high  level  of  these  countries’  foreign  liabilities  makes  an  excessive 
depreciation undesirable, considering the threat this would pose to financial stability, in other 
economies the authorities welcome the depreciation given its favourable impact on external 
competitiveness.  In  2009,  the  latter  countries  have  been  facing  capital  inflows  generating 
appreciation pressures and many of them have chosen to intervene in order to counter these 
pressures.  In  this  respect,  it  is  worth  mentioning  the  massive  interventions  of  the  Swiss 
National Bank and the devaluation of the Singapore dollar in the spring of 2009, the frequent 
interventions of the Bank of Israel and the joint interventions of the central banks in Thailand, 
South Korea, Singapore and the Philippines.

As  for  Romania’s  economy,  some  adjustments  would  have  been  very  painful  for  want  of 
external financial support. For instance, if the risk of a financing gap had materialised at the 
highest level expected for 2009, then the depreciation pressures on the leu would most likely 
have generated a currency crisis with a negative impact on inflation and, implicitly, on leu-
denominated  financial  assets  of  households.  Other  adjustments,  such  as  the  cut  in  public 
spending,  wage  cuts 
that  government  expenditures  had  reached 
unsustainable levels during the massive capital inflow cycle, would have borne the hallmark 
of lesser credibility. In such an environment, the arrangement concluded with the IMF and 
the  EU  brought  about  two  major  advantages  to  Romania’s  economy:  coverage  of  the 
external financing deficit and credibility.

Lower depreciation pressures on the leu and, implicitly, lower inflationary pressures ceteris 
paribus that emerge via the exchange rate channel, along with the fiscal consolidation efforts 
allowed the central bank to adopt a cautious easing of the monetary policy stance, which will 
make  the  descending  slope  of  the  GDP  less  sharp,  without  fuelling  further  inflationary 
pressures.  The  expected  developments  in  GDP,  inflation  and  the  current  account  deficit
