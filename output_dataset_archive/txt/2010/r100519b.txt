Philipp Hildebrand: Setting the course for the Swiss economy – 
challenges for the Swiss financial centre and outlook for the future 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Philipp  Hildebrand,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the 
Swiss National Bank, to the Zürcher Volkswirtschaftliche Gesellschaft, Zurich, 17 May 2010. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 The Swiss banks face two major challenges. First, sooner or later, they will have to carry out 
their  core  business  –  asset  management  for  foreign  customers  –  in  a  tax-conform 
environment.  Second,  the  big  banks  will  be  required  to  operate  under  more  stringent 
regulatory  requirements.  These  challenges  are  likely  to  lead  to  structural  changes  in  the 
financial  centre.  How  are  such  changes  likely  to  affect  the  Swiss  economy?  An  empirical 
analysis  shows  that,  although  the  financial  centre  plays  an  important  role  in  the  Swiss 
economy, it also entails considerable risks. In the case of cross-border asset management, 
the  relationship  between  the  risk  to  the  economy  and  the  income  earned  is  acceptable. 
However, this is hardly the case for the banks’ own trading activities. Consequently, current 
regulatory efforts could not only improve the stability of the financial sector, but also increase 
both  the  profitability  of  banks  and  the  benefit  which  the  Swiss  economy  derives  from  the 
financial sector over the long-term period. Meanwhile, it is of key importance, not just for the 
financial centre but for Switzerland as a whole, that an acceptable solution be found for the 
taxation of foreign bank deposits.
