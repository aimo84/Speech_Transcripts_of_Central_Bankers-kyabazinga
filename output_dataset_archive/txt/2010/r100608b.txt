Philipp Hildebrand: Key factors for the Swiss economy – financial market 
regulation in Switzerland 
Speech by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National 
Bank, Swiss Economic Forum, Interlaken, 4 June 2010. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website. 
 The  financial  system  is  the  life  blood  of  our  economy.  Key  measures  to  increase  the 
resilience of the financial system have already been implemented in Switzerland. However, 
they  have  not  addressed  the  fundamental  problem,  which  is  that  systemically  important 
banks cannot at present be allowed to fail. 
The  commission  of  experts  set  up  by  the  government  to  examine  ways  of  alleviating  this 
problem published its interim report a few weeks ago. The report proposes measures in the 
areas of capital, liquidity and organisational structure. This approach is in line with the key 
points on the Financial Stability Board’s agenda. The interim report is an important milestone 
in the efforts to address the “too big to fail” issue.  
Naturally, we still face considerable challenges. Moreover, cross-border solutions are required 
for the “too big to fail” question. The commission’s proposals represent a constructive step 
towards global cooperation. 
If the key points on the Financial Stability Board’s agenda are not implemented in the major 
financial centres, we will ultimately be left empty handed. One of the few positive aspects of 
the  financial  crisis  has  been  the  unprecedented  international  collaboration  to  combat  the 
crisis  and  the  endeavours  to  cooperate  internationally  on  regulatory  reform.  Successful 
further cooperation along these lines is in the interests of us all.
