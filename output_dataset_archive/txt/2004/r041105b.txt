Philipp M Hildebrand: Where is productivity growth in Europe? 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Dr  Philipp  M  Hildebrand,  Member  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Swiss 
National Bank, to the Vereinigung Basler Ökonomen, Basel, 28 October 2004. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 Since 1996 the E.U. is lagging behind the U.S. in terms of productivity growth. This phenomenon has 
become  more  pronounced  since  2001.  The  growth  of  GDP  per  work  hour  in  the  E.U.  between  the 
periods  1990-1995  and  1995-2002  is  lower  by  two  percentage  points  per  year.  This  difference 
amounts to 2,8 percentage points per year if one compares the periods 1990-1995 and 2000-2005. 
Differences in GDP measurement account for roughly 0,5 up to a maximum of 1 percentage point of 
the  productivity  growth  differential.  The  remaining  difference  is  caused  by  two  factors.  On  the  one 
hand, total factor productivity growth has accelerated in the U.S. This was made possible by a wide-
ranging restructuring of the U.S. economy which provided an optimal backdrop for the new information 
and communication technologies. On the other hand, capital deepening in Europe was lessened by 
employment growth. The productivity of this additional labour input has to be increased through strong 
educational  efforts,  open  markets  and  additional  investment.  Labour  market  reforms  remain 
indispensable  in  order  to  enhance  the  productivity  of  all  workers.  Product  market  reforms  will  be 
crucial in order to unleash the full productivity potential of the new technologies. Increasing productivity 
is the key to securing our welfare and the stability of our social security systems.
