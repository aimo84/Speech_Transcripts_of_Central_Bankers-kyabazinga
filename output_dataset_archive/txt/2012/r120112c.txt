Rodrigo Vergara: The Monetary Policy Report and the Financial Stability 
Report 
Presentation  by  Mr  Rodrigo  Vergara,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  before  the 
Finance  Commission  of  the  Honorable  Senate  of  the  Republic,  Santiago  de  Chile, 
20 December 2011.

 Introduction 
Mr.  President  of  the  Finance  Commission  of  the  Senate,  Senator  Eduardo  Frei,  senator 
members of this Commission, ladies, gentlemen: 
This  is  my  first  time  presenting  as  the  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile  before  the 
Senate’s Finance Commission. I thank you this invitation to share with you the vision of the 
Central Bank Board on recent macroeconomic and financial developments, its prospects and 
implications for monetary and financial policy. This vision is contained with detail in the latest 
Monetary Policy Report (December 2011) and Financial Stability Report (second half 2011), 
which we today make available for this Commission and the country at large. 
The Chilean economy is evolving soundly. During the past few quarters it has been able to 
sustain vigorous growth in output and employment. Inflation is currently within the tolerance 
range  and  medium-term  expectations  are  aligned  with  the  midpoint  of  said  range.  Public 
finances  are  solvent.  The  private  sector  shows  healthy  conditions.  The  financial  system 
shows strong indicators, the corporate sector is on a good standing and the households’ debt 
has – on average – evolved in line with income. In recent years, our exports have benefited 
from growth in emerging Asia and our terms of trade, despite a recent drop, are still high by 
historic standards. The terms of our access to international credit are still privileged. And we 
have the resources we need to deal with potential emergencies.  
Our macroeconomic policy framework, which comprises a monetary policy governed by an 
inflation  target,  a  floating  exchange  rate  and  the  fiscal  rule,  has  been  determinant  in  this 
result, as has been the regulation and supervision framework of our financial system. 
Despite  this  favorable  internal  scenario,  the  evolution  of  the  developed  world’s  economic 
outlook has made us again uncertain about how the global economic situation will unfold and 
how  it  will  affect  our  country.  The  lateness  and  lack  of  resolution  of  fiscal  and  financial 
problems  in  the  Eurozone  have  constrained  global  financial  conditions,  deteriorated  the 
growth prospects of the world in general and our trading partners in particular, and reduced 
our terms of trade. All these factors combined have an effect on Chile’s economic growth, 
whose  magnitude  is  yet  to  be  seen.  The  baseline  scenario  of  the  Monetary  Policy  Report 
assumes a limited impact, but there are important risks. 
The Great Recession of developed economies in 2008–2009 is not totally over. Solving the 
macroeconomic  and  financial  imbalances  where  the  crisis  originated  will  take  a  long  time, 
and its effects will remain visible in the world economy. In the past few months, the concerns 
about the Eurozone have escalated, significantly raising the cost of public financing in some 
economies like Italy and Spain and, a little less so, France and Germany, among others. The 
problem  has  grown  to  a  vicious  circle  from  government’s  financing  costs  to  the  bank’s 
financial situation to credit and liquidity conditions to economic growth. The lack of exchange 
rate  adjustment  mechanisms  inside  the  Eurozone  only  aggravates  the  situation.  Policy 
makers  have  been  facing  severe  difficulties  to  implement  structural  and  emergency 
measures to help contain the effects. The announcements of the European Union early in 
December are one first step in that direction, but there are elements that must be figured out 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

and the road to the solution is still uncertain and probably winding. The prospects for the rest 
of the developed world are not as bad, but not good either. Certainly their problems are not 
as  severe  as  the  Eurozone’s,  but  they  are  growing  slowly  and  will  not  pick  up  for  a  long 
while. Consumers there are still in the process of cutting down their debts and governments 
need to begin a phase of austerity to try to make their sovereign debts sustainable. 
The emerging economies, without the problems of their developed counterparts, have been 
affected via their commercial and financial links with them. Despite strong growth in the past 
several  quarters,  the  weakness  of  the  developed  countries  will  eventually  erode  their 
dynamism,  a  situation  that  is  already  apparent  in  some  countries.  However,  unlike  the 
developed economies, the emerging world has more space to implement economic policies 
that help mitigate the effects of the worsened external scenario. Chile has this capacity too. 
Actually, according to several international assessments, Chile is among the best suited to 
confront such a scenario. 
Our country has made progress in recent decades to build an economic policy framework, 
which has already given proof of its capacity to properly deal with a difficult conjuncture. If 
necessity demands it, we have the capacity to adopt the necessary measures to mitigate the 
effects  of  the  global  crisis  on  our  economy.  The  lessons  learned  from  the  experience  of 
2008–2009 give us a positive edge.  
The  external  impulse  that  our  economy  will  be  receiving  in  the  coming  quarters  will  be 
smaller than we thought just a few months back. However, we must not forget that still our 
relative position in the world is favorable. We have managed to diversify the destinations of 
our  exports  and  China  is  now  our  main  client.  The  copper  price  and  the  terms  of  trade, 
although not as good as some months ago, are still high from a historical perspective. Our 
country risk is low and, although our external financing cost has risen in recent weeks, it is 
still  lower  than  it  was  in  previous  years  ago.  Also,  as  discussed  in  depth  in  our  Financial 
Stability Report, our financial system is well prepared to deal with more adverse conditions 
abroad without becoming an additional source of unrest. 
But  as  I  said  before,  there  are  important  risks.  We  are  attentive  to  the  evolution  of  the 
external scenario and its effects on our economy. We have the tools necessary to deal with 
adverse situations, and, most importantly, we have the firm determination to act to mitigate 
the impact of external environment on the Chilean economy. 
Now let me describe in detail the current macroeconomic scenario, our projections, the risks 
that remain and where our economy – particularly its financial system – stands, to address 
them. 
Macroeconomic scenario 
As  I  just  said,  economic  and  financial  developments  of  the  past  few  months  have  been 
dominated by events from abroad. The crisis of the Eurozone has widened and deepened as 
distrust builds up with respect to the region’s fiscal, banking and economic situation. All this 
has  reflected  in  high  volatility  in  global  financial  markets,  increases  in  risk  premiums  and 
liquidity, falling prices of financial assets and commodities, an appreciation of the dollar and a 
downward revision of global growth projections (figure 1). 
The  transmission  of  the  global  crisis  to  the  emerging  world  has  proceeded  through  the 
financial channel – via higher debt premiums and net capital outflows –, falling commodity 
prices – especially for metals and agricultural products –, and a reduction in manufacturing 
exports.  For  the  moment,  the  signs  of  output  deceleration  in  the  emerging  world  are 
moderate  and  consistent  with  September’s  forecasts.  Manufacturing  production  is  down  in 
some economies, and distrust has increased. Worth noting is the slowdown in Brazil and, to 
a  lesser  extent,  in  China  (figure  2).  Considering  forecasts  of  slower  global  growth  and  its 
effects  on  the  inflationary  outlook,  a  number  of  central  banks  at  both  developed  and 
emerging economies have begun to increase the monetary impulse.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
In Chile, these events have had limited effects. The financial market is showing somewhat 
tighter conditions echoing the situation in the global markets, which can be seen also in other 
emerging economies (figure 3). In recent months, Chile’s sovereign and corporate long-term 
debt  premiums  increased  50  and  70  basis  points,  respectively,  mainly  from  August  and 
coinciding  with  a  reduction  in  investments  in  local  bonds  by  international  investors.  After 
being  stable  for  a  long  period,  the  cost  of  short-term  bank  credit  rose  to  spreads  around 
110 basis points lately – 45 basis points more than in September. It is worth noting, however, 
that  the  local  banking  system  has  a  diversified  credit  base.  It  recently  reduced  its  funding 
from  European  banks,  but  compensated  with  increased  funds  from  the  United  States, 
Canada and Asia. 
The  higher  volatility  has  also  affected  stock,  fixed-income  and  currency  markets,  a 
phenomenon that is also present elsewhere (figure 4). Said volatility, although not as high as 
it was in late 2008, may be unchanged or even higher for as long as the fiscal and financial 
problems  of  developed  economies  remain  unresolved.  Hence,  as  underscored  in  our 
Financial  Stability  Report,  it  is  important  that  financial  agents  and  firms  in  the  real  sector 
internalize this extra volatility in their risk management operations. 
Domestic  output  has  performed  somewhat  short  of  September’s  projections,  although 
domestic demand is still strong, partly driven by higher employment and wages (figure 5). In 
recent months, there is evidence of inventory depletion in some sectors such as retail and 
manufacturing, reflecting the higher external uncertainty. 
CPI inflation has been above 3% in the past few months and is expected to end the year in 
3.9% (annual). Core measures are still bounded. The latest CPI figures have exceeded the 
September forecasts because of the prices of some particular items (e.g. meats), plus the 
effect of the exchange rate depreciation (figure 6). 
Within this context, the Board has held the monetary policy rate (MPR) at 5.25% since July.  
Our assessment is that the worsened external scenario will have consequences on growth 
and  inflation  in  Chile,  as  well  as  for  the  orientation  of  our  monetary  policy.  Let  me  now 
describe the assumptions shaping the baseline scenario of our Monetary Policy Report and 
Financial Stability Report. It forecasts that financial tensions in world markets will go on, as 
difficulties in the Eurozone will take time to clear. This will mean that in the two-year period 
2012–2013  world  growth  will  be  slower  than  foreseen  in  September.  We  now  anticipate  a 
recession in the Eurozone in 2012, based on the recent indicators of manufacturing output 
and expectations in the region. 
In the U.S., recent output indicators have been somewhat better than expected, but not so 
much as to modify the view that this economy will experience a long period of slow growth, 
but  not  a  recession.  Political  difficulties  to  agree  on  a  gradual  fiscal  adjustment  plan  have 
increased the uncertainty about the performance of the U.S. economy. 
Emerging  economies  will  grow  less  than  we  thought  in  September,  but  still  outperforming 
their developed counterparts. China’s GDP growth will slow down in 2012–2013, to 8.2% in 
2012 and 8.5% in 2013. These figures, although high, are the lowest since 2001. 
All  these  data  combined  result  in  a  forecast  for  world  growth  in  2012  and  2013,  0.5  and 
0.4 percentage  points  less  than  assumed  in  September.  The  terms  of  trade  will  also  drop 
from  2011.  The  scenario  assumes  a  copper  price  averaging  US$3.5/lb  and  US$3.4/lb  in 
2012  and  2013,  respectively.  The  prices  of  oil  and  fuels  will  follow  a  downward  trend 
(table 1). 
The  reduced  external  impulse  assumed  in  the  baseline  scenario  will  translate  into  slower 
growth in Chile than forecast in September. The main sources of this revision are the weak 
external  demand  affecting  domestic  activity,  stringent  international  financial  conditions  and 
reduced terms of trade. In 2012, the Chilean economy will grow in the 3.75%–4.75% range, 
after growing 6.2% in 2011 (table 2). In this scenario, headline inflation will drop to around 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 3
3% in the first half of 2012, and will hover around that figure through the end of the projection 
horizon, this time the fourth quarter of 2013 (figure 7). 
These  projections  use  as  a  working  assumption  that  the  real  exchange  rate  will  be  fairly 
unchanged over the next two years, based on our assessment of its current level, which is 
within  the  range  that  is  thought  to  be  consistent  with  its  long-term  fundamentals.  The 
appreciation  of  the  dollar  in  the  global  market  has  also  affected  the  Chilean  peso.  The 
peso/dollar parity has depreciated around 10% between the statistical cutoff of this and the 
latest Monetary Policy Report. Over the same period, the level of the real exchange rate has 
also risen, almost 4%. This behavior of the dollar has eased to some extent the exchange 
rate pressures that were being felt in emerging economies by mid-year (figure 8).  
Regarding monetary policy, in a baseline scenario where the effects of external uncertainty 
over our economy are bounded, the working assumption used is that the MPR will follow a 
path  that  in  the  short  term  is  comparable  with  what  can  be  inferred  from  the  various 
expectations surveys (figure 9). 
As usual, the baseline scenario reflects the events that are estimated to be the most likely to 
occur with the information at hand at the close of the Monetary Policy Report. However, there 
are many risks that might significantly divert the performance of the world economy from the 
baseline  scenario.  In  fact,  today  these  risks  are  greater  than  on  other  occasions.  The 
repercussions  on  the  Chilean  macroeconomic  outlook  of  scenarios  other  than  the  one 
described are varied and, in some cases, difficult to calculate. This time, after assessing the 
likelihood of alternative scenarios, we estimate that the risk balance is biased downward for 
output, and unbiased for inflation. 
The main risks have to do with the way the Eurozone situation will unfold. The possibilities 
range  from  a  deeper  recession  than  foreseen  in  the  baseline  scenario  due  to  a  sharper 
contraction  of  fiscal  expenditure  and  credit,  to  a  financial  or  currency  crisis  with  a  severe 
impact on the world economy and financial markets. 
It is also possible that emerging economies are hurt more than foreseen, causing deeper or 
more lasting effects on world growth and commodity prices. And we cannot rule out a further 
weakening of the U.S. economy, depending on the fiscal policy trajectory. 
Such  a  scenario  abroad  would  affect  the  Chilean  economy.  The  combination  of  tighter 
external financial conditions, a drop in the terms of trade and slower growth of our trading 
partners could have a more negative incidence in the evolution of Chile’s GDP growth in the 
projection  horizon.  However,  its  effects  can  be  mitigated  by  monetary,  fiscal  and  financial 
policy actions. 
Although  the  negative  scenarios  dominate,  it  is  possible  that  Eurozone  policy  makers 
succeed in building a set of measures and reforms that soon restore market confidence. In 
any  case,  in  such  a  scenario,  given  the  required  fiscal  adjustments,  the  developed 
economies would continue to lag for a long period and would hold on to their loose monetary 
policies for some time. This would intensify the dichotomy between growth in advanced and 
emerging countries. In this context, a resurgence of capital inflows to emerging economies is 
a possibility. 
Domestically, one risk that cannot be ruled out are stronger effects from the higher external 
uncertainty,  hitting  harder  the  local  financial  markets,  confidence,  and  consumption  and 
investment decisions. 
Notwithstanding the capacity of economic policies to mitigate the effects of a more adverse 
external  environment,  it  is  important  for  the  private  sector  to  properly  administer  financial 
risks. Worth noting are the favorable financial indicators of the corporate sector (figure 10). In 
addition,  currency  mismatches  continue  to  be  stable  and  bounded,  despite  the  increasing 
role  of  external  debt  as  a  source  of  funding.  Still,  it  must  be  pointed  out  that  financial 
intermediaries would be wise to keep a watchful eye on credit risk, considering its negative 
effects on external demand implied in the risk scenarios.

As  for  households,  on  average  the  financial  situation  has  not  deteriorated.  The  recent 
increase in private consumption has evolved hand in hand with labor income. The evidence 
suggests  that,  so  far,  borrowing  has  not  risen  above  its  long-term  trend,  and  the  average 
debt-to-income  and  debt-to-financial  burden  ratios  are  stable.  Along  the  same  line, 
households’  past-due  portfolio  indicators  have  tended  to  stabilize  in  relatively  low  levels 
during the past year (figure 11). 
In  the  present  scenario,  however,  we  need  to  continue  to  closely  monitor  the  evolution  of 
household  debt.  If  it  continues  to  grow  at  the  current  pace,  it  is  possible  that  households’ 
debt  and  financial  burden  will  increase  significantly  in  the  face  of  a  more  severe  risk 
scenario.  Finally,  and  considering  the  deterioration  of  the  financial  indicators  of  the  lower-
income  households  in  the  period  2007–2009,  they  could  find  themselves  in  a  situation  of 
greater  financial  vulnerability.  Although  the  volume  of  debt  of  these  households  is  fairly 
limited,  it  could  prove  substantial  for  some  credit  providers  focusing  on  lower-income 
segments. 
Problems  in  international  financial  markets  have  caused  a  widespread  rise  in  the  banks’ 
external financial cost. Meanwhile, no reduction in volume or maturity of external credit for 
this  sector  is  observed.  (figure  12).  The  banking  system  has  maintained  a  looser  liquidity 
position  since  late  2008  –  thanks  to  increases  in  longer-term  liabilities  and  greater  liquid 
assets. As stated in our Financial Stability Report, our banking system has the capital levels 
needed to absorb the materialization of a severe risk scenario. The stress tests show that the 
current levels of capitalization of the banking industry would permit it to absorb an episode of 
sharp GDP slowdown, an increase in CLP funding cost and an exchange rate depreciation. 
As I said at the beginning, if some of the described risks materialize, the country can resort to 
its  robust  economic  policy  framework,  capable  of  mitigating  the  negative  effects  of  the 
external  situation.  The  Central  Bank  has  the  necessary  mechanisms  and  tools  in  place  to 
react decisively to adverse scenarios and reduce the costs on the domestic economy, always 
honoring the Board’s commitment to conduct monetary policy aiming to ensure that projected 
inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. 
Now let me share with you some final thoughts. 
Final thoughts 
The presentation of our two reports coincides with a period where global financial tensions 
have increased and are posing great risks. Also with the start of my term as Central Bank 
governor,  in  which  I  expect  not  only  to  keep  and  continue  to  consolidate  the  position  this 
Institution has achieved, but also to continue to adjust our policy framework to the challenges 
that impose us the deep changes that the global economy is going through. 
In  the  immediate  future,  our  greatest  challenge  is  to  address  in  the  best  way  possible  the 
effects of the external crisis on our country. To that end, it will be necessary to use both our 
expertise  and  the  tools  available  in  the  right  dosage  and  in  a  timely  basis.  In  the  past 
decades  we  have  made  significant  advances  in  our  economic  policy  framework.  These 
advances allow us to feel at peace in the face of the present scenario, being confident that 
we have the necessary tools to cushion the effects of a scenario of those characteristics. 
On the other hand, the evolution of the global economy and the causes and consequences of 
the Great Recession of 2009 have left important lessons for economic policy makers. It is our 
responsibility  now  to  incorporate  these  lessons  into  the  design  and  management  of  our 
macroeconomic policy framework. 
A  first  lesson  is  that  price  stability  is  a  necessary  but  not  sufficient  condition  for  financial 
stability.  In  an  adverse,  highly  volatile  external  environment  like  we  have  seen  in  recent 
years, our inflation targeting regime with a flexible exchange rate has performed quite well.

During the global crisis, the Chilean financial system displayed great strength. However, the 
experience  of  other  countries  has  confirmed  the  importance  of  paying  special  attention  to 
financial developments and the possible creation of vulnerabilities on that front. To that end, 
it  is  critical  to  develop  a  systemic  view  of  financial  risks,  aside  from  the  soundness  of 
individual financial institutions. The Financial Stability Report we prepare at the Bank seeks 
to deliver said overall view. The creation of the Financial Stability Board provides a forum to 
which we have committed our active participation. Our challenge in the coming years will be 
to  consolidate  this  Board,  in  order  to  enhance  our  assessment  of  risks  threatening  the 
stability of the Chilean financial system. 
Lesson number two is that, in the face of threats to financial stability, preventive actions work 
best,  seeking  to  anticipate  the  problems.  The  costs  of  a  crisis  of  this  nature  are  high  and 
long-lasting, so even at the risk of being mistaken, we’ll rather be safe than sorry. Still, the 
interest  rate  as  an  instrument  is  neither  sufficient  nor  necessarily  effective  in  preventing 
financial  imbalances  to  develop.  More  focused  instruments  are  needed  –  ranging  from 
financial regulation to given the market clear signals of the risks –, which permit to take direct 
action on the problem. Given the nature of the regulation and supervision framework of the 
Chilean  financial  system,  every  now  and  then  this  policy  will  call  for  close  coordination 
between the Central Bank and the Superintendences. 
Lesson  number  three  is  that,  during  episodes  of  financial  stress,  the  Central  Bank  also 
requires  using  a  battery  of  instruments  –  aside  from  the  short-term  interest  rate  –  to  help 
stabilize the economy. During the crisis of 2008–2009, the Central Bank of Chile introduced 
new tools to inject liquidity into the economy and enhance the effectiveness of its monetary 
policy making. Also, in 2008 and 2011, we intervened in the forex market, obeying both to a 
prudential  motivation  (i.e.,  accumulating  more  international  liquidity)  and  to  a  conjunctural 
one: the evolution of the real exchange rate.  
Today  we  are  again  facing  a  scenario  of  external  turbulence.  Thus,  we  need  to  continue 
developing and adjusting our policy toolkit to the changes in the financial environment. 
Our experience of recent years has also taught us the importance of close and transparent 
communication of our assessments of the economy and its prospects, as it fosters a better 
understanding and effect of our decision. This is an area where we have made substantial 
progress in the past few years, but where there are always new challenges ahead. Among 
these  challenges,  we  believe  that  improving  the  general  public’s  financial  education  is  an 
important one. We will actively cooperate in initiatives in that sense. 
During these years the Central Bank has contributed to the country’s economic development 
by acting on inflation which, throughout history, has proven to be one of the greatest plagues 
a society can suffer, especially its most vulnerable segments. 
As the new Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, I want to confirm to this Commission our 
commitment to carry on the work done to this date, always ensuring high technical rigor in 
the  analyses  and  decisions,  as  well  as  making  every  effort  to  take  our  Institution  to  the 
highest possible standards. 
Our  responsibility  is  twofold.  On  one  hand,  keeping  inflation  low  and  stable,  favoring 
sustainable  growth.  On  the  other,  using  our  powers  to  identify  and  address  the  risks  that 
could jeopardize the normal functioning of our financial system. This, of course, seeking to 
preserve the conditions that will foster economic growth and the welfare of the population. 
Thank you.
