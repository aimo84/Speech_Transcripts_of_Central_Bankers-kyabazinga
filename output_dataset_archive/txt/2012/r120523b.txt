Sayuri Shirai: Recent global economic developments and monetary 
policy in Japan – strengthening Japan’s growth momentum through 
opportunities in emerging Asia 
Speech by Ms Sayuri Shirai, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at a meeting 
with business leaders, Akita, 10 May 2012. 
 Introduction 
I. 
Good morning, everyone. My name is Sayuri Shirai, and I am a Policy Board member of the 
Bank  of  Japan.  I  am  delighted  to  be  speaking  to  you  today,  representing  as  you  do  the 
administrative, economic, and financial communities in Akita Prefecture. And as well, I feel 
deeply honored to be able to exchange views with you about performance and other issues 
related to Japanese and overseas economies, particularly with regard to the developments in 
this region. 
First,  let  me  briefly  outline  the  content  of  my  presentation.  I  would  like  to  begin  by 
summarizing recent economic and price developments. These are described in great detail in 
the  Bank’s Outlook  for Economic  Activity  and  Prices,  which  was  published  last month  and 
which I will refer to as the Outlook Report. In this first part of my presentation, I also wish to 
discuss  matters  regarding  Japan’s  monetary  policy  and  related  developments.  Following 
that,  I  aim  to  shed  light  on  recent  economic  and  financial  developments  in  emerging 
economies, particularly in Asia – “emerging Asia.” This is because I believe that this region 
could provide Japanese firms with an opportunity to increase the demand for their products 
and services. At the same time, emerging Asia has the potential to revitalize the Japanese 
economy, if economic relations between Japan and this region could be enhanced – not only 
in terms of trade and tourism, but also through cross-border financial movements.

Recent developments in economic activity, prices, and Japan’s monetary 
policy 
International financial markets and overseas economies 
A. 
As we are all aware, strains in global financial markets intensified last summer, mainly owing 
to concerns about the European debt problem. However, since then the strains have eased 
somewhat, thanks to the following factors: (1) large-scale longer-term refinancing operations 
(LTROs)  with  a  maturity  of  36  months  conducted  by  the  European  Central  Bank  (ECB); 
(2) coordinated action undertaken by the six central banks, including the Bank of Japan, to 
lower the pricing on existing temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements by 50 basis 
points;  and  (3)  achievement  of  orderly  public  debt  restructuring  between  the  Greek 
government  and  private  creditors  –  and the  subsequent  second-round financial  assistance 
from the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
Under  such  improved  circumstances,  risk  aversion  among  global  investors  has  weakened 
compared  with  the  second  half  of  2011,  and  positive  market  developments  have  been 
observed,  including  a  pick-up  in  stock  prices  around  the  world.  In  the  foreign  exchange 
market,  the  yen  has  depreciated  somewhat  against  both  the  U.S.  dollar  and  the  euro 
compared  with  around  the  end  of  2011.  Nonetheless,  we  should  continue  to  monitor 
developments  in  international  financial  markets, including  foreign  exchange  markets,  since 
there still remains a high degree of uncertainty related to market conditions. 
With regard to overseas economies, the pace of growth began to slacken in spring 2011. In 
recent  months,  however,  some  positive  developments  have  been  observed.  The  U.S.

economy  continues  to  recover  at  a  moderate  pace.  The  sluggishness  in  the  European 
economy  remains  strong  mainly  due  to  the  effects  of  fiscal  austerity  measures.  More 
recently, however, the economy generally stopped deteriorating further as financial markets 
have regained some stability. In the case of emerging and commodity-exporting economies, 
the  relatively  high  growth  has  on  the  whole  been  maintained  since  domestic  demand  has 
been solid, and exports to advanced economies appear to have recovered. 
B. 
Developments in economic activity and prices in Japan: present conditions 
and outlook 
We all recall how the Great East Japan Earthquake undermined the Japanese economy and 
caused serious damage to supply chains in the manufacturing sector. With the restoration of 
supply chains, Japan’s economic activity picked up steadily, though that recovery lasted only 
until autumn 2011. From the second half of fiscal 2011, economic activity remained more or 
less  flat  mainly  due  to  an  adverse  effect  on  exports  and  production  of  the  slowdown  in 
overseas economies and the appreciation of the yen. More recently, however, it has become 
increasingly evident that the economy is shifting toward a pick-up phase, although economic 
activity has remained more or less flat (Chart 1). 
As for the outlook, the Japanese economy is expected to return to a moderate recovery path 
in the first half of fiscal 2012. This is a likely scenario, since the pace of recovery in overseas 
economies  should  pick  up  –  led  largely  by  the  emerging  and  commodity-exporting 
economies  –  and  reconstruction-related  domestic  demand  after  the  Great  East  Japan 
Earthquake should gradually strengthen. In fiscal 2013, the economy is expected to continue 
to grow at a pace above its potential, as overseas economies continue to achieve relatively 
high growth. However, the economic growth rate is expected to be somewhat lower than that 
in fiscal 2012 because the positive effects from reconstruction-related domestic demand are 
likely to gradually diminish (Chart 2). 
With regard to prices, developments in the consumer price index (CPI; for all items less fresh 
food) indicate that after reaching a historical trough of 2.4 percent in August 2009, the year-
on-year rate of decline has continued to slow consistently since around the end of 2009. In 
recent months, that rate of change has been at around 0 percent. In terms of the outlook for 
prices, the rate of change will remain in positive territory and show a gradual increase as the 
aggregate supply and demand balance is expected to continue improving with the moderate 
recovery. International commodity prices are likely to follow a moderate rising trend owing to 
an  expected  increase  in  demand  for  food  and  energy  in  line  with  the  growth  in  emerging 
economies.  Assuming  that  medium-  to  long-term  inflation  expectations  remain  stable,  the 
rate of change in the CPI is projected to gradually rise to a range of above 0.5 percent and 
less than 1 percent toward the second half of fiscal 2013. Thereafter, it will likely be not too 
long before the rate reaches the Bank’s “price stability goal in the medium to long term” of 
1 percent  for  the  time  being,  as  specified  in  the  Bank’s  statement  released  in  February 
(Chart 2). 
Comparing  the  current  projection  for  real  GDP  growth  rates  with  that  in  the  January  2012 
interim  assessment,  the  rate  of  growth  for  fiscal  2012  is  likely  to  be  higher  than  initially 
assessed. This reflects an improvement in the financial markets driven by the reduced tail 
risk  associated  with  the  European  sovereign  debt  crisis.  Comparing  the  current  CPI 
projection with that in the January 2012  interim assessment, the rates of change for fiscal 
2012 and 2013 are also likely to be somewhat higher than originally assessed. This is partly 
because  the  upwardly  revised  economic  projection  is  expected  to  improve  the  aggregate 
supply and demand balance. The correction of the sharp appreciation of the yen and a rise in 
crude oil prices also contributed to the upward revision in the CPI projection.

in  overseas  economies; 
Upside and downside risks 
C. 
The  aforementioned  outlook  is  the  scenario  the  Bank  considers  to  be  the  most  likely  –  in 
other words, its baseline scenario. As described in detail in the Outlook Report, the following 
four major risks concerning the outlook for economic activity warrant attention: (1) uncertainty 
regard 
related 
to 
(2)  uncertainty  with 
reconstruction-related  domestic  demand;  (3)  uncertainty  associated  with 
firms’  and 
households’  medium-  to  long-term  growth  expectations;  and  (4)  issues  related  to  Japan’s 
fiscal sustainability. 
Among developments in overseas economies, various challenges remain in Europe. Though 
the tail risk of global financial market turmoil causing a significant global economic downturn 
has  decreased,  the  fundamental  cause  of  such  a  risk  has  not  been  resolved.  There  is  a 
possibility  that  strains  in  global  financial  markets  will  once  again  intensify  if  concerns 
reemerge  about  implementing  fiscal  and  structural  reforms,  especially  in  the  peripheral 
European countries. If such strains reemerge, they are likely to act as a downside risk to the 
global economy – and thus to the Japanese economy. Moreover, given that there is a high 
degree  of  uncertainty  surrounding  the  progress  in  households’  balance-sheet  adjustments, 
the prospects for the U.S. economy also present some downside risk. It is possible that the 
pace of its economic recovery will remain more moderate than expected. 
Regarding risks associated with prices, there are mainly two types. The first risk concerns 
developments  in  firms’  and  households’  medium-  to  long-term  inflation  expectations;  the 
second  risk  relates  to  developments  in  import  prices.  With  this  second  risk,  there  is  a 
possibility that crude oil prices will surge mainly reflecting geopolitical risk. If that does occur, 
there will be a deterioration in Japan’s terms of trade, which will squeeze firms’ profits and 
reduce  households’  purchasing  power,  ultimately  having  an  adverse  effect  on  the  whole 
Japanese economy. 
Conduct of monetary policy 
D. 
The Bank is naturally concerned about the long-term prevalence of deflation in the Japanese 
economy.  To  help  the  economy  overcome  deflation,  comprehensive  monetary  easing  was 
introduced  in  2010  by  establishing  the  Asset  Purchase  Program.  Subsequently,  monetary 
easing has gradually been enhanced through expansion of the Program. 
On February 14 of this year, the Bank introduced “the price stability goal in the medium to 
long  term,”  which  is  defined  as  the  inflation  rate  consistent  with  price  stability  sustainable 
over  the  medium  to  long  term.  The  purpose  of  this  action  was  to  promote  public 
understanding  of  the  Bank’s  determination  to  overcome  deflation.  It  was  decided  that  the 
goal would be “within a positive range of 2 percent or lower in terms of the year-on-year rate 
of change in the CPI,” and the goal was set at 1 percent for the time being. Moreover, the 
Bank made it clear that it would continue pursuing powerful monetary easing – through its 
virtually  zero  interest  rate  policy  and  continued  implementation  of  the  Program  –  until  it 
judged the 1 percent goal to be in sight, on condition that it identified no significant risk to the 
sustainability of economic growth, including from the accumulation of financial imbalances. At 
the  same  time,  the  total  size  of  the  Program  was  raised  by  10  trillion  yen,  from  about 
55 trillion yen to about 65 trillion yen (Chart 3). 
On  April  27,  the  Bank  decided  to  increase  the  total  size  of  the  Program  further  by  about 
5 trillion yen, from about 65 trillion yen to about 70 trillion yen with the following changes in its 
composition. First, the purchase of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) was increased by 
about  10  trillion  yen.  Second,  the  purchases  of  exchange-traded  funds  (ETFs)  and  Japan 
real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) were raised by about 200 billion  yen and 10 billion 
yen,  respectively.  Third,  the  maximum  outstanding  amount  of  the  Bank’s  fixed-rate  funds-
supplying  operation  against  pooled  collateral  with  a  six-month  term  was  reduced  by  about 
5 trillion  yen,  taking  into  account  the recent  episodes  of  undersubscription.  And fourth, the 
remaining maturity of JGBs to be purchased under the Program was extended from “one to 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 3 
two years” to “one to three years.” The same treatment was applied to the remaining maturity 
of corporate bonds to be purchased under the Program. In addition, it was decided that the 
schedule  for  increasing the  outstanding  amount of  the  Program to  about  65  trillion  yen  by 
around  the  end  of  2012  would  be  maintained.  It  was  further  decided  to  increase  the 
outstanding amount of the Program to about 70 trillion yen by around the end of June 2013. 
Now, given that the outlook for the performance of economic activity and prices has not been 
adjusted downward compared with the January 2012 interim assessment, some may argue 
that the timing of the Bank’s action at this time was questionable. On this point, I would like to 
stress  that  there  remains  a  high  degree  of  uncertainty  surrounding  the  assessment,  as 
already  explained.  The  positive  signs  in  economic  and  price  developments  that  have 
emerged in recent months do not necessarily imply that the baseline scenario will be realized 
as projected. Even though the scenario may eventually materialize, it is still not certain how 
soon it may do so. Considering recent episodes, for example, there were some cases where 
the baseline scenario was not fulfilled, even though the economy appeared to be on the track 
of  sustainable  economic  growth  and  prices  also  initially  appeared  to  be  rising  steadily. 
Therefore, the Bank decided to seize this occasion and further enhance monetary easing to 
better ensure the return of the Japanese economy to sustainable growth with price stability. I 
believe  this  action  also  demonstrates  the  Bank’s  determination  to  implement  its  monetary 
policy commitment, as explained earlier. 
In order to overcome deflation, however, it is important to stress the need to address Japan’s 
long-term structural challenge of declining trend growth rates amid rapid population aging. To 
meet this challenge and establish a new basis for economic growth, firms need to become 
more innovative and competitive in an effort to add value to their activities and explore new 
sources  of  demand  both  at  home  and  abroad. The  government  also  needs  to  support  the 
business community by creating a more business-friendly environment. Financial institutions 
should  make  further  efforts  to  strengthen  the  foundations  for  economic  growth  by  giving 
financial support to innovative and viable firms and providing new types of financial and other 
services, which are increasingly being demanded. 
Meanwhile,  the  Bank’s  accommodative  monetary  policy  will  certainly  support  such  private-
sector activities through a steady decline in the cost of raising capital. By promoting longer-
term  economic  growth,  the  Bank  has  supported  the  business  community  indirectly:  it 
introduced  the  fund-provisioning  measure  to  support  strengthening  the  foundations  for 
economic  growth  (the  Growth-Supporting  Funding  Facility)  in  2010,  and  it  has  provided 
longer-term fixed-rate funds to financial institutions. This facility was expanded in March and 
April of this year (Chart 4). It should be emphasized that the goal of overcoming deflation will 
be achieved through such continuous, comprehensive efforts by firms, financial institutions, 
the government, and the Bank within their respective roles. 
Changing economic features of advanced and emerging economies 
III. 
As  already  mentioned,  I  believe  that  overcoming  deflation  in  Japan  requires  policies  and 
private-sector 
the  Bank’s 
accommodative monetary policy. In line with this view, I would like to explain the importance 
of  emerging  economies  as  a  potential  source  for  generating  economic  growth  in  the 
Japanese economy.

Growing presence of emerging economies 
A. 
The  Japanese  economy  has  confronted  a  series  of  large-scale  shocks  in  recent  years. 
Among them, the global financial crisis of 2008–09 presented the greatest shock to both the 
global and Japanese economies, causing a rapid shrinking in production and trade around 
the  world.  In  response,  it  was  agreed  at  the  G20  Summit  that  coordinated  policy  actions 
would be conducted to quickly stabilize financial markets and prevent the global recession 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
from  deepening  further.  Thus,  central  banks  and  governments  collectively  reacted  to  the 
crisis with liquidity injections into the financial sector, bailouts, and fiscal stimulus packages. 
Since these accommodative policies helped stimulate both domestic and overseas demand, 
the  global  economy  succeeded  in  avoiding  a  deep  recession  like  that  of  the  Great 
Depression in the 1930s, and the average rate of global growth dropped by only 0.7 percent 
in 2009. 
What  has  become  evident  after  the  global  financial  crisis  is  that  the  overall  economic 
performance  of  emerging  economies  has  been  better  than  that  of  advanced  economies. 
Advanced  economies  were formerly  viewed  by  emerging  economies  as  role  models. They 
were highly respected and deemed worthy of emulation, because advanced economies had 
already  achieved  a  higher  level  of  living  standards  and  produced  numerous  firms  with 
advanced  skills,  management  styles,  and  knowledge.  Their  macroeconomic  performance 
also  used  to  be  regarded  as  relatively  stable,  as  exemplified  by  low,  stable  inflation  and 
sound  government  fiscal  positions.  Advanced  economies  were  also  equipped  with  well-
developed  legal  and  judiciary  systems  and  mature  democratic  societies.  Most  of  these 
features are unchanged today, but there is a growing view among emerging economies that 
the  path  toward  economic  and  social  development  need  not  be  the  one  adopted  by 
advanced  economies:  alternative  approaches  can  be  explored  according  to  a  particular 
country’s conditions and history. 
Features of emerging economies 
B. 
I would now like to highlight four features that have developed in emerging economies since 
the occurrence of the global financial crisis. 
Impressive growth-generating power 
B-1. 
The  economic  size  of  emerging  economies  is  rapidly  expanding.  As  a  result,  they  are 
increasingly functioning as an engine of global growth. Based on IMF data, for example, the 
purchasing  power  parity  (PPP)-adjusted  share  of  global  GDP  of  advanced  economies 
dropped from a high level of 63 percent in 2000 to 51 percent in 2011. By contrast, that of 
emerging  economies  rose  from  37  percent  to  49  percent  over  the  same  period  (Chart  5). 
China  stands  out  among  the  emerging  economies.  It  has  exhibited  an  impressive 
performance,  having  doubled  its  share  of  the  global  GDP  from  7  percent  in  2000  to 
14 percent  in  2011.  India  follows  China,  with  its  global  GDP  share  having  jumped  from 
3.7 percent to 5.7 percent over the same period. Brazil ranks third in terms of economic size 
after China and India, but its global GDP share was unchanged at around 3 percent over that 
period. Thus, it can be stated that emerging Asia has made more impressive progress than 
emerging economies in other regions. 
The  rapid  growth  of  emerging  economies  implies  that  their  growth-generating  power  is 
greater  than  that  of  advanced  economies.  This  can  be  grasped  by  considering  historical 
movements in real GDP growth rates. Here, the period of 2000–11 will be divided into two 
sub-periods  –  before  and  after  the  2007  global  financial  crisis  –  namely,  2000–07  and  
2007–11.  It  is  evident  that  the  difference  in  average  growth  rates  between  emerging  and 
advanced economies increased from 3.9 percent in 2000–07 to 5.3 percent in 2008–11.1 
                                                
1  
It is true that the growth rate for emerging economies has declined during this period, but their average growth 
rate decreased only modestly – from 6.5 percent in 2000–07 to 5.6 percent in 2008–11. Among them, China’s 
growth  rate  declined  only  from  10.5  percent  to  9.6  percent  over  that  period,  and  it  still  exhibits  one  of  the 
highest economic growth rates in the world. In the case of India, its rate showed an increase of 7.1 percent to 
7.7 percent over this period. Like India’s, the growth rate of Brazil rose from 3.5 percent to 3.8 percent during 
this period. Overall, the growth performance in emerging economies, particularly those of Asia, is impressive. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 5 
This growing gap is mainly attributable to the decline in the average growth rate of advanced 
economies. Their average rate of growth almost reached minus 4 percent in 2009; though 
their subsequent growth became positive, it has remained modest (Chart 6). In Japan, the 
average  growth  rate  in  the  pre-crisis  period  reached  1.5  percent,  but  it  dropped  to  minus 
1 percent  following  the  crisis.  In  particular,  its  economic  activity  plunged  by  5.5  percent  in 
2009.  Japan  managed  to  achieve  a  4.4  percent  growth  rate  the  following  year,  but  the 
country then suffered further blows in 2011: the Great East Japan Earthquake and flooding in 
Thailand  caused  serious  damage  to  supply  chains  in  the  manufacturing  sector  mainly 
through  a  sharp  curtailment  of  production  and  exports.  In  the  United  States,  the  average 
growth  rate  dropped  from  2.6  percent  in  the  pre-crisis  period  to  0.2  percent  following  the 
crisis. The U.S. economy experienced its sharpest decline of 3.5 percent in 2009, though it 
has since displayed modest but positive growth. 
Favorable fiscal performance 
B-2. 
Emerging  economies  enjoy  a  relatively  favorable  fiscal  position,  and  in  sharp  contrast  to 
advanced economies they have continued to show an improvement in this regard. This may 
indicate not only that the likelihood of succumbing to a sovereign debt crisis in the near future 
has  declined  for  emerging  economies,  but  also  that  they  have  some  room  to  adopt  an 
accommodative fiscal policy in the downturn phase of the economic cycle. According to IMF 
data, the fiscal deficit as a share of GDP jumped from 1.5 percent in 2001 to 6.5 percent in 
2011  among  advanced  economies;  among  emerging  economies,  however,  this  deficit  was 
reduced  from  around  2.8  percent  to  under  2  percent  over  the  same  period  (Chart  7). 
Similarly, the public debt-to-GDP ratio for advanced economies rose from 73 percent in 2000 
to  104  percent  in  2011,  but  emerging  economies  managed  to  reduce  the  size  of  this ratio 
from 49 percent to 36 percent over the same period (Chart 8). 
Above all, China’s fiscal position has remained relatively solid: its fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio 
dropped from  3.3  percent  in  2000 to  1.2  percent  in  2011,  and  its  public  debt-to-GDP ratio 
rose from only 16 percent to 26 percent over the same period.2 Despite its prolonged fiscal 
deficit performance, India also managed to reduce its deficit ratio from 10 percent in 2000 to 
8.7 percent in 2011; it decreased its public debt ratio from 72 percent to 68 percent over the 
same  period.3  By  contrast,  Japan’s  fiscal  position  deteriorated:  its  deficit  ratio  grew  from 
around  7.5–8.0  percent  in  2000  to  10  percent  in  2011,  and  its  public  debt  ratio  increased 
from 140 percent to 230 percent over the same period. This debt figure is the largest among 
advanced economies. 
Rising capital inflows from the rest of the world 
B-3. 
From  a  consideration  of  cross-border  capital  flows,  it  is  notable  that  private-sector  capital 
flows to advanced countries in the EU have dropped, while those to emerging Asia and Latin 
America have grown (Chart 9). Private-sector capital inflows consist largely of foreign direct 
investment (FDI), portfolio investment, and such other forms as loans and deposits. Private-
sector  capital  inflows  to  emerging  economies  are  concentrated  in  portfolio  investment, 
followed by FDI. In recent years, there has in addition been an increase in capital inflows in 
terms of other items. 
                                                
2  The National Audit Office of the People’s Republic of China reported that the country’s local government debt 
accounted for around 27 percent of GDP last year. Some observers believe that China’s actual public debt is 
greater than the officially reported figure and that the debt-to-GDP ratio should stand at around 55 percent. 
However, this ratio still remains well below that of advanced economies. 
3   As for other emerging economies, it has been reported that upgradings of Indonesia’s sovereign debt by some 
credit-rating firms to investment grade around the end of 2011 has attracted the attention of global investors, 
including pension and insurance funds. 
6 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
Asian  emerging  economies  face  a  more  rapid  pace  of  capital  inflows  than  emerging 
economies of other regions. From 2000 to 2011, the amount of capital inflows to emerging 
Asia  showed  an  8.8-fold  expansion.  This  growth  is  greater  than  that  for  emerging  Latin 
American economies, whose capital inflows showed only a 4.6-fold increase over the same 
period.  As  a  result,  capital  inflows  to  emerging  Asia  as  a  share  of  total  capital  inflows  to 
emerging economies rose impressively from 32 percent in 2000–02 to 48 percent in 2011. 
Latin America lost its leading position in terms of total capital inflows, with its share dropping 
from 37 percent to 29 percent over the same period. 
An  increase  in  capital  flows  to  emerging  economies  indicates  that  these  economies  are 
becoming  important  capital  importers.  This  trend  can  be  attributed  to  their  continued  high 
economic growth, as well as the presence of a large number of potential investment projects 
and high demand for credit, which reflects the development stage of their economies. This 
explanation is supported by the fact that returns on investments to emerging economies have 
been higher than those on investments to advanced economies (Chart 10). 
Gradually evolving external investment activities 
B-4. 
While it is true that emerging economies are major importers of private-sector capital inflows 
from around the world, one feature is becoming increasingly evident in emerging Asia: once 
figures  on  overseas  investment  by  the  monetary  authorities  and  government  are  added  to 
cross-border capital flow data, it is seen that these economies are also becoming important 
capital exporters. This suggests that the amount of capital outflows exceeds that of capital 
inflows in emerging Asia, thereby transforming it into a net capital exporter. 
In  the  past,  advanced  economies  played  the  role  of  net  capital  exporters  as  a  result  of 
abundant  capital  and  relatively  limited  domestic  demand  for  credit.  By  the  middle  of  the 
2000s,  however,  this  situation  had  changed,  as  some  emerging  economies  shifted  from 
being net capital importers to exporters. In particular, it is remarkable to note that China has 
become  the  largest  net  capital  exporter  in  the  world,  followed  by  Japan  and  Germany.  In 
other words, China – even though its per capita income is below 8,000 U.S. dollars and thus 
its  income  level  is  regarded  as  medium  –  exports  more  capital  than  Japan  and  Germany, 
whose  per  capita  income  of  over  30,000  U.S.  dollars  marks  their  status  as  high-income 
nations. In addition, China is becoming a major financier of advanced economies, such as 
the  United  States.  In  Asia,  many  economies  –  including  Hong  Kong,  Indonesia,  Malaysia, 
Singapore,  the  Philippines,  and  Thailand  –  have,  like  China,  also  become  net  capital 
exporters. 
IV. 
Strengthening Japan’s growth momentum through growth opportunities in 
emerging Asia  
Deepened economic relations between Japan and emerging Asia 
A. 
I  have  pointed  out  that  emerging  Asia  has  many  favorable  features  relative  to  advanced 
economies.  I  would  now  like  to  emphasize  how  Japan  has  already  begun  deepening  its 
economic relations with  these economies. Indeed, Japan’s trade value  with emerging Asia 
exceeds that with the United States and Europe. Specifically, China has become Japan’s top 
trade  partner.  At  the  same  time,  Japan’s  trade relations  with  the  Association  of  Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) and South Korea have been rapidly developing. I would like to stress 
that emerging Asia is not only important to Japan as a trade partner, but also is becoming 
essential  as  a  tourism  partner.  According  to  data  released  by  the  World  Tourism 
Organization  (UNWTO),  Germany,  the  United  States,  and  China  are  among  the  countries 
with  a  large  overseas  tourism  expenditure.  These  days,  Chinese  tourists  are  commonly 
encountered in many places in Japan. There is no doubt that China is becoming one of the 
most important importers of Japan’s tourism services.

In addition to trade and tourism, cross-border capital flows have quickly expanded between 
Japan and emerging Asia, especially in the form of FDI. Therefore, I would like to address 
now  the  possibility  of  making  use  of  rising  growth  opportunities  in  emerging  Asia  by 
activating  cross-border  capital  flows  with  a  view  to  increasing  trend  growth  rates  and 
revitalizing  the  Japanese  economy.  This  presentation  will  proceed  with  the  issue  of  FDI, 
followed by portfolio investment and banking activities. 
Expanding FDI flows between Japan and emerging Asia 
B. 
With the growing number of middle- and high-income consumers, emerging economies have 
experienced an increase in domestic demand, and thus the markets for goods and services 
have expanded. Japanese firms have made efforts to provide such goods and services. They 
are able to meet such demand if they modify their production capacity to satisfy the specific 
needs and conditions that exist in various emerging economies by establishing locally based 
production, marketing, and sales networks. In this regard, Japan’s outward FDI has rapidly 
expanded over recent years. Data released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and 
Development  (UNCTAD)  indicate  that  Japan’s  outward  FDI  grew  by  105  percent  year  on 
year to 115.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2011.4  
By region, FDI to emerging Asia grew by 63 percent year on year to 3 trillion yen in 2011 
(Chart 11).5 In very recent years, Japan’s outward FDI to the ASEAN countries – especially 
to Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam – has exceeded that to China. Japan’s FDI to Thailand 
has been concentrated in the areas of electrical machinery, general machinery, and iron and 
nonferrous  metals.  After  the  severe  flooding  in  Thailand  at  the  end  of  last  year  damaged 
production facilities in a number of Japanese-operated industrial zones, Japanese firms have 
boosted  FDI  into  Thailand  to  restore  their  production  and  export  capacity.  Japan’s  FDI  to 
Indonesia has been increasing in the transportation machinery sector thanks to Indonesia’s 
rapidly growing demand for automobiles. In the case of Vietnam, where labor costs are lower 
than  in  neighboring  emerging  economies,  Japan’s  FDI  has  undergone  expansion  in  the 
electrical machinery sector. Regarding China, Japan’s FDI has traditionally centered on the 
manufacturing sector; however, recently it has grown in the wholesale and retail sectors, as 
well  as  the  real  estate  sector,  mainly  in  provincial  cities  in  the  process  of  urbanization.  In 
India, Japan’s FDI has not undergone a rapid increase despite strong interest on the part of 
Japanese  firms;  this  is  because  the  slow  administrative  approval  process  for  investment 
projects and a shortage of industrial sites are believed to act as obstacles. 
In addition to Japan’s outward FDI, it is equally important to examine its inward FDI with a 
view to making use of rising growth opportunities in emerging Asia. Inflows of FDI to Japan 
may provide the opportunity to promote innovation and thus revitalize the domestic economy. 
The  level  of  Japan’s  inward  FDI  from  emerging  Asia  has  been  positive  over  the  past  five 
years,  although  the  value  declined  moderately  in  2011  compared  to  the  previous  year 
(Chart 12).  Singapore,  whose  FDI  is  concentrated  in  the  construction  sector,  is the  largest 
supplier of FDI to Japan. In addition, FDI from South Korea has maintained positive growth 
rates since 2005. Investment from Hong Kong and China to Japan has also remained solid. 
A major Japanese electronics producer sold some of its electrical appliance operations to a 
                                                
4  Over half of this figure reflects large-scale M&A activity conducted by a major Japanese pharmaceutical firm. 
Therefore, outward FDI may not continue at this magnitude in the future. 
5  Some  observers  have  pointed  out  that  expansion  of  outward  FDI  promotes  the  hollowing-out  of  Japanese 
industry and reduction of employment opportunities in Japan. However, it is equally possible that outward FDI 
will  lead  to  an  increase  in  production  and  employment  in  Japan  if  establishing  global-level  production  and 
sales networks increases demand for goods and services produced by Japanese firms. In addition, achieving 
a global-level division of labor and increased sophistication of domestic industry as a result of reorganizing 
firms may enhance the international competitiveness and revenue-generating power of those firms.

large Chinese electronics firm this year. Last year, a Chinese computer manufacturer formed 
a personal computer joint venture with a Japanese computer-manufacturing firm.  
Such moves may reflect cross-border M&A activities in the face of tougher global competition 
and  the  need  to  promote  corporate  restructuring  and  reorganization.  FDI  inflows  to  Japan 
have also been witnessed in the area of medical and welfare services – where the potential 
demand  is  high  due  to  the  rapidly  aging  society  –  as  well  as  in  energy-saving  and 
environment-friendly  businesses.  Nonetheless,  the  scale  of  Japan’s  inward  FDI  remains 
roughly  one-tenth  of  its  outward  FDI  to  emerging  Asia.  Since  firms  in  emerging  Asia  are 
swiftly growing and becoming multinational, it is likely that the scale of inward FDI to Japan 
will expand. 
Gradually expanding portfolio investment between Japan and emerging Asia 
C. 
I would now like to examine recent trends in cross-border portfolio investment. At one time, 
the  securities  market  in  emerging  Asia  was  underdeveloped,  and  the  banking  sector 
dominated  the  financial  system.  This  situation  has  changed  in  recent  years  with  the  rapid 
growth of the securities market. 
Regarding bond markets, it used to be the case that Asian economies had difficulty in issuing 
domestic  currency-denominated  bonds  internationally,  because  foreign  investors  did  not 
want  to  bear  exchange  rate  risks  and thus  preferred  U.S.  dollar-denominated  assets. This 
prevented the market from developing. However, as their macroeconomic performance has 
stabilized and become more favorable, and their governments have begun to liberalize their 
financial markets, emerging economies have become increasingly capable of issuing bonds 
denominated  in  both  foreign  and  domestic  currencies.  If  East  Asia,  including  Japan, 
collectively  makes  further  progress  in  terms  of  improving  each  economy’s  financial 
infrastructure – for example, in clearing and settlement institutions and securities depository 
institutions – as well as standardizing securities regulations, cross-border investment is likely 
to prosper. 
With regard to the stock market, the number of listed firms is rapidly increasing in emerging 
Asia.  As  a  result,  the  number  of  initial  public  offering  (IPO)-related  listed  firms  currently 
accounts for over half of the world total. In addition, the share of stock market capitalization 
in East Asia and the Pacific region now accounts for over 30 percent of the world total. 
The  development  of  securities  markets  in  emerging  Asia  provides  a  revenue-enhancing 
opportunity for Japanese investors. But as well, Asia’s growing savings could be utilized on a 
global scale for a wide range of firms, including those of Japan. Given that investors in each 
economy  generally  have  different  investment  patterns  and  risk  attitudes,  some  Japanese 
firms  may  be  able  to  make  use  of  such  funds  in  the  process  of  exploring  new  business 
models and strategies. 
Over  the  past  decade,  securities  markets  have  become  increasingly  synchronized  at  the 
international  level.  In  general,  securities  markets  among  Japan,  the  United  States,  and 
Europe have shown a relatively high degree of synchronization. This is because cross-border 
investment  has  long  been  carried  out  through  well-developed  institutional  investors  and  a 
large  number  of  multinational  firms.  In  addition,  Japan  has  historically  enjoyed  a  strong 
economic relationship with the United States. Therefore, the prices of Japanese stocks and 
bonds tend to be highly correlated with those of the United States and Europe (Chart 13).6

It  is  well  known  that  Japan  has  been  the  world’s  largest  net  external  creditor,  reflecting  its  considerable 
external assets. Generally, Japan’s portfolio investment is centered on medium- and long-term bonds (such as 
Treasury securities, agency bonds, and corporate bonds in the United States and bonds in Europe). Although 
some investment had been made in stocks in the United States and Europe, the global financial crisis has 
promoted a shift of Japanese investors’ preference from stocks to medium- and long-term bonds. Meanwhile, 
overseas  securities  investment  in  Japan  is  generally  concentrated  on  medium-  and  long-term  bonds  and 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

Though there remains a strong one-way influence from the United States to Japan and other 
Asian  economies,  there  are  growing  signs  that  integration  of  securities markets  is  steadily 
taking  place  between  Japan  and  emerging  Asia.  In  particular,  their  stock  markets  have 
shown  increasingly greater integration since the early 2000s. This may  be associated with 
the  establishment  of  region-wide  production  and  trade  networks  in  Asia.  Japan  has  been 
exerting a strong influence on other Asian stock markets. In recent years, the influence of 
China on stock markets in this region has increased. And this is consistent with the growing 
importance of China in the post-crisis period.7 The greater synchronization in Asia suggests 
that stock markets are more prone to common shocks, rather than country-specific shocks, 
and  therefore  investors  may  benefit  less  from  diversifying  their  portfolios  across  the  Asian 
region.  At  the  same  time,  however,  greater  cooperation  in  macroeconomic  policies  and 
financial infrastructure may contribute to stabilizing stock markets, and thus encourage their 
further development (Chart 14). 
There  is  also  a  high  degree  of  synchronization  in  the  bond  markets  of  Japan,  the  United 
States,  and  Europe  (Chart  15).  However,  it  is  likely  that  with  further  development  of  bond 
markets, financial integration will deepen  in the Asian region in the near future (Chart 16). 
One contributing factor to an increase in capital inflows to bond markets in emerging Asia is 
interest rate differentials between emerging and advanced economies. Since interest rates 
are generally higher in the former than in the latter, global investors tend to engage in carry 
trade investment – investment in search of higher yields without hedging foreign exchange 
risk, which is thus highly speculative – in periods of high appetite for risk. Therefore, it should 
be noted that capital flows to emerging economies tend to become highly volatile, as do their 
bond prices. 
D. 
Increasing cross-border banking activities between Japan and emerging Asia 
Finally,  I  would  like  to  consider  cross-border  banking  activities.  As  mentioned  earlier,  the 
financial system in emerging Asia has traditionally been characterized as bank-dominant. In 
this  region,  foreign-owned  financial  institutions  are  prominent  in  the  fields  of  long-term 
finance,  such  as  project  finance,  and  trade  credit,  some  of  whose  services  require 
sophisticated  skills  and  experiences.  With  the  worsening  of  the  European  sovereign  debt 
problem, some financial institutions in Europe have begun to withdraw from those fields. 
In  the  case  of  Japan,  overseas  lending  activities  by  Japanese-owned  financial  institutions 
began to decline sharply in the 1990s, mainly as a result of nonperforming-loan problems. In 
recent years, there has been a shift in this trend as these financial institutions have begun to 
actively  extend  credit  overseas  again (Chart  17).  Lending  activities  to  emerging  Asia  have 
undergone  a  particularly  brisk  expansion  through  both  Japanese-  and  non-Japanese 
affiliated firms. While the presence of European banks has declined in this region, Japanese-
owned  financial  institutions  have  been  swiftly  extending  credit  to  such  countries  as  China, 
Indonesia,  South  Korea,  Malaysia,  and  Thailand,  thereby  mitigating  the  adverse  impact  of 
                                                                                                                                                   
stocks.  There  was  a  short-lived  but  rapid  increase  in  investment  from  overseas  in  Japanese  short-term 
sovereign  bonds  from  the  autumn  of  2011  to  the  beginning  of  2012,  when  a  worsening  of  the  European 
sovereign  debt  problems  aggravated  strains  in  the  global  financial  markets  and  increased  demand  for 
Japanese sovereign bonds as safe assets. 
7   For example, the Progress of Asian Economic Integration Annual Report 2012 compiled by the Boao Forum 
for Asia reports the correlation of stock market index returns between countries. From 2002 to 2006, Japan 
was  positively  correlated  with  all  other  Asian  economies.  After  the  global  financial  crisis,  there  has  been  a 
trend  of  increasing  stock  market  synchronization  in  Asia.  In  particular,  China  has  become  increasingly 
important as its correlations with India, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore have 
grown. Some studies indicate that Singapore, India, and Japan have stronger impacts on Asian stock markets 
(for example, see Meric et al., “Co-Movements of and Linkages between Asian Stock Markets,” Business and 
Economics Research Journal, 2012).

deleveraging  by  European  banks.  In  an  increasing  number  of  cases,  Japanese  financial 
institutions act as leading banks in arranging syndicated loans and project finance. 
Most  economies  in  emerging  Asia  still  lack  basic  infrastructure,  including  systems  of 
transportation,  energy  supply,  information  and  communications,  and  water  supply  and 
sewerage.  A  deficiency  of  adequate  long-term  funds  hinders  infrastructure  development  in 
this region. This points to the large potential demand for such long-term credit. It is estimated 
that the scale of this credit demand will amount to 8 trillion U.S. dollars between 2010 and 
2020,  according  to  data  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Public  funds  are 
insufficient  to  meet  such  credit  demand,  and  this  signifies  the  need  for  private-sector 
initiatives and funds in the form of long-term loans and bond finance. There are thus growing 
business opportunities for Japanese financial institutions. 
At the same time, it is important for Japanese financial institutions to make greater efforts to 
support entrepreneurial new businesses that endeavor to supply goods and services in areas 
of  potentially  high  demand.  Those  areas 
treatment  and  welfare, 
environment, and energy. Under these circumstances, financial institutions are expected to 
provide  innovative,  demand-responsive  financial  services.  Such  efforts  are  likely  to  bolster 
the  competitive  advantages  of  Japanese  financial  institutions,  since  the  skills  and 
experiences gained from such activities in Japan may lead to greater business opportunities 
in other Asian economies. It should be noted that some of these Asian economies are also 
expected to face growing aging populations in the near future. 
That  brings me to  the  end  of my  presentation. Thank  you  very  much  indeed for  your kind 
attention.

The Bank of Japan’s Conduct of Monetary Policy 
1. Introduction of “the Price Stability Goal in the Medium to Long Term”
 The inflation rate consistent with price stability sustainable in the medium to long term.
 A positive range of 2 percent or lower in terms of  the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer 
price index (CPI). A goal of 1 percent is set for the time being.
2. Clarification of the Bank’s Determination to Pursue Monetary Easing
 Aiming at achieving the goal of 1 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI.
 Pursuing powerful monetary easing by conducting the Bank’s virtually zero interest rate policy and 
by implementing the Asset Purchase Program mainly through the purchase of financial assets until 
the Bank judges that the 1 percent goal is in sight.
 On condition that the Bank identifies no significant risk to the sustainability of economic growth, 
including from the accumulation of financial imbalances.
3. Increase in the Asset Purchase Program
 About 55 trillion yen → about 65 trillion yen (Feb. 2012)→ about 70 trillion yen (April 2012)
 In addition to purchases under the Program, the Bank regularly purchases Japanese government bonds at 
the pace of 21.6 trillion yen per year.

 Enhancement of Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Strengthening the 
Foundations for Economic Growth 
The Bank decided to substantially enhance the fund-provisioning measure to support strengthening the 
foundations for economic growth both in terms of the yen and a foreign currency.
 Provision of funds to financial institutions, equivalent to the actual amount of lending and 
investment carried out with a view to strengthening the foundations for economic growth, over a 
long term (maximum duration of four years) and at a low rate (currently 0.1 percent)
1. Main Rules
 3.0 trillion yen⇒ 3.5 trillion yen (eligible investments and loans: 10 million yen or more)
2. Special Rules for Small-Lot Investments and Loans
 0.5 trillion yen newly added (eligible investments and loans: 1 million yen or more but 
less than 10 million yen)
3. Special Rules for a New U.S. Dollar Lending Arrangement (April 2012)
 1.0 trillion yen (12 billion U.S. dollars) newly added (eligible investments and loans: 
denominated in foreign currencies)
With special rules for asset-based lending (ABL) (eligible investments and loans: equity investments and 
ABL), the total amount is 5.5 trillion yen. The deadline for applications for new loans is March 2014.
