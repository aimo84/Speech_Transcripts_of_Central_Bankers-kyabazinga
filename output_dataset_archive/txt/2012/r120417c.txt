Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile: The Bank of Uganda’s primary dealer 
system 
Remarks  by  Mr  Emmanuel  Tumusiime-Mutebile,  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Uganda,  at  the 
Annual Primary Dealer Award Ceremony, Bank of Uganda, Kampala, 7 March 2012. 
 Distinguished Guests  
Chief Executive Officers of Primary Dealer Banks  
Members of the press  
Ladies and Gentlemen  
Good Morning,  
It is my great pleasure to welcome you all to this ceremony, which is organized to recognize 
the best performing Primary Dealer in Uganda Government Securities for the year 2011 – the 
7th Annual Primary Dealer Award Ceremony.  
In  February  2003,  The  Bank  of  Uganda  introduced  the  primary  dealer  system.  The  main 
objectives were to:  
(i) 
(ii) 
Promote financial markets development. 
Stimulate  and  broaden  the  government  securities  market  through  increased 
competition.  
As you all know, Primary dealers serve as trading counterparties of the Bank of Uganda in its 
implementation  of  monetary  policy.  This  role  includes  the  obligation  to  participate 
consistently in BOU’s open market operations and to provide the Bank of Uganda’s trading 
desk  with  market  information  and  analysis  that  is  relevant  to  the  formulation  of  monetary 
policy.  
I am happy to note that the Primary dealers have played their role effectively. The Primary 
dealers have contributed to the growth of the market for Government securities as indicated 
by the bid to cover ratio for auctions in excess of two times coverage for the years 2009 to 
2011.  Additionally,  secondary  market  turnover  in  2011  was  35%  (as  a  percentage  of 
outstanding stock). This is a good indicator of liquidity in the debt market. Having said that, 
let  me  recognize  all  the  Primary  Dealers  present  here  today  for  your  contribution  towards 
market development.  
I would like to reiterate that Bank of Uganda’s policy direction for 2012 will continue to focus 
on making the Ugandan market more attractive, resilient, efficient and competitive. Financial 
Markets are crucial to any country’s financial sector development.  
At  this  stage  allow  me  to  mention  a  number  of  on  going  initiatives  that  are  at  advanced 
stages of implementation.  
(i) 
BOU is in the process of upgrading and customizing the Reuters system to enable 
banks report money market and forex transactions in real time. It is expected that 
this initiative will enhance transparency and minimize price distortions in the market.  
BOU is currently revamping its website to provide additional market information by 
the development of a yield curve matrix for T-bonds and T-bills which will provide a 
daily pricing mechanism for all outstanding government securities. Additionally, we 
believe the matrix will focus investor interest on the yield curve, while at the same 
time stimulate secondary and repo market trading.

(v) 
The enhanced Central Securities Depository system is expected to go live by June 
this year, this will provide among other functionalities, e-bidding in primary auctions, 
automated repo auctions and online secondary market trading.  
The debt reforms that will lead to the introduction of non bank Broker/Dealers in the 
debt market are on going. It is our expectation that this will significantly increase the 
retail end of the market.  
Plans  are  underway  to  introduce  a  bond  calendar.  This  will  improve  predictability 
and regularize debt issuance.  
The successful implementation of the above reforms will largely depend on your continued 
cooperation.  
Turning to today’s event, I wish to acknowledge the role this year’s award winner has played 
especially  in  providing  more  consistent  coverage  and  pricing  in  the  primary  auctions  and 
repo operations. I applaud your efforts and I call upon all the Primary Dealers to work harder 
this year to fulfill their market obligations.  
Ladies  and  gentlemen,  it  is  with  great  pleasure  that  I  announce  that  STANBIC  BANK 
UGANDA LTD is the Primary Dealer of the YEAR 2011. I now invite the Managing Director 
to receive the award.  
Congratulations and I thank you.
