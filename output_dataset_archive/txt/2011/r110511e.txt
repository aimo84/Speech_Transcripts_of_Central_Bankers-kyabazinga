Introduction 
1. 
Is the world becoming short-sighted? As individuals, it sometimes feels that way. Information 
is  streamed  in  ever  greater  volumes  and  at  ever  rising  velocities.  Timelines  for  decision-
making appear to have been compressed. Pressures to deliver immediate results seem to 
have intensified. Tenure patterns for some of our most important life choices (marriage, jobs, 
money) are in secular decline.1 Some have called this the era of “quarterly capitalism”.2  
These  forces  may  be  altering  not  just  the  way  we  act,  but  also  the  way  we  think. 
Neurologically, our brains are adapting to increasing volumes and velocities of information by 
shortening attention spans. Technological innovation, such as the world wide web, may have 
caused a permanent neurological rewiring, as did previous technological revolutions such as 
the  printing  press  and  typewriter.3  Like  a  transistor  radio,  our  brains  may  be  permanently 
retuning to a shorter wave-length.  
If  these  forces  are  real,  they  might  be  expected  to  be  particularly  important  in  capital 
markets. These are a key conduit for choice over time. An efficient capital market transfers 
savings  today  into  investment  tomorrow  and  growth  the  day  after.  In  that  way,  it  boosts 
welfare. Short-termism in capital markets could interrupt this transfer. If promised returns the 
day after tomorrow fail to induce saving today, there will be no investment tomorrow. If so, 
long-term growth and welfare would be the casualty. 
Yet, despite its potential importance for long-term growth, studies of short-termism in capital 
markets  are  relatively  thin  on  the  ground.  There  is  a  sharp  disconnect  between  popular 
perception of  rising  myopia,  driven  by  technology  and  neurology,  and  empirical  evidence.4 
This  paper  aims  to  provide  some  evidence  on  short-termism  drawing  on  equity  market 
experience. It is planned as follows. 
Section  2  reviews  existing  evidence  on  short-termism.  Section  3  describes  the  theory 
underlying  our  test  of  short-termism  and  its  adverse  implications  for  investment  choice. 
Section  4  presents  the  empirical  results,  drawing  on  cross-sectional  and  time-series  data. 
Section 5 draws out the investment implications of the results and sets out a potential menu 
of policy options.

respondents believe that short-termism exists in equity markets, but provided little evidence to demonstrate 
the scale of the consequences for companies and investors” (Department for Business, Innovation and Skills 
(2011)).

Our  evidence  suggests  short-termism  is  both  statistically  and  economically  significant  in 
capital markets. It appears also to be rising. In the UK and US, cash-flows 5 years ahead are 
discounted at rates more appropriate 8 or more years hence; 10 year ahead cash-flows are 
valued as if 16 or more years ahead; and cash-flows more than 30 years ahead are scarcely 
valued at all. The long is short. Investment choice, like other life choices, is being re-tuned to 
a  shorter  wave-length.  Public  policy  intervention  might  be  needed  to  correct  this  capital 
market myopia. 
The short-termism debate 
2. 
The short-termism debate is not new. Excess discounting of future outcomes was a familiar 
theme  among  Classical  economists.  For  Jevons,  “the  untutored  savage,  like  the  child,  is 
wholly occupied with the pleasures and troubles of the moment; the morrow is dimly felt; the 
limit of his horizon is but a few days off”.5 For Marshall, people acted like “children who pick 
the plums out of their pudding to eat them at once”.6 For Pigou, it demonstrated a “defective 
telescopic faculty” such that “we see future pleasures on a diminished scale”.7  
And  nowhere  were  these  problems  more  acute  than  in  financial  markets.  Keynes,  himself 
part-time speculator, was well-aware of the perils of short-termism in investment choice, both 
moral  and  financial:  “It  is  from  time  to  time  the  duty  of  a  serious  investor  to  accept  the 
depreciation of his holdings with equanimity without reproaching himself. Any other policy is 
anti-social,  destructive  of  confidence  and  incompatible  with  the  working  of  the  economic 
system”. 8 
In  the  US,  these  sentiments  were  echoed  in  the  immediate  post-war  era  by  Benjamin 
Graham, the original “value investor” and yesteryear investment guru to today’s investment 
guru, Warren Buffett: “A serious investor is not likely to believe that the day-to-day or even 
month-to-month fluctuations of the stock market make him richer or poorer”.9 And, famously, 
“in the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine”. 
Whether an untutored savage, defective telescope or anti-social voting machine, something 
sounded amiss. 
Thus far, however, this evidence was largely anecdotal. It was not until the 1960s that the 
short-termism  hypothesis  was  first  tested  empirically.  This  drew  on  survey  evidence  from 
investing  firms.  It  found  that  investors  typically  expected  full  pay-back  on  an  investment 
within 3 to 5 years. At the time, the average life of plant and equipment was often 10 times 
that.10 Firms played short even when they desired long.  
The first quantitative evidence that discount rates might be high began to appear in the early 
1970s.  For  example,  King  (1972)  examined  investment  in  plant  and  machinery  in  the  UK. 
Empirical  estimates  suggested  the  internal  discount  rate  implied  by  firms’  corporate 
investment decisions may be up to 25%.11 This literature failed to catch fire. Starting in the

6   Marshall (1890). 
7   Pigou (1920). 
8   Keynes (1938). 
9   Graham (1949). 
10  Neild (1964) and the National Economic Development Office (1965) used questionnaire-based evidence.  A 
large proportion of firms in the sample claimed to use a pay-back criterion and of these the modal pay-back 
period  was  3–5  years.  Census  evidence  from  this  period  indicated  that  the  average  useful  lifespan  of 
machines was over 15 years. The distribution of plant and equipment lives in Dean and Irwin (1964) implied a 
mean economic life of 34 years. 
11  Sumner (1974) reaches similar conclusions.

mid-1970s, it was doused by a torrent of papers testing – and typically failing to reject – the 
efficient markets hypothesis.  
This new wave swamped empirical finance for the better part of a decade. In the late 1970s 
and early 1980s, the efficient markets paradigm appeared all-conquering as a description of 
asset  price  movements  in  practice.12  Research  on  the  inefficiencies  of  capital  markets 
became something of a backwater. The voting machine appeared to be delivering outcomes 
both democratic and socially beneficial. 
But  beginning  in  the  1980s,  a  whole  sequence  of  “puzzles”  in  empirical  finance  began  to 
emerge. These were puzzles only in the sense of being deviations from efficient markets. For 
Mr Keynes and the Classicists, they would have been anything but.13 For example, an early 
set  of  papers  found  “excess  volatility”  in  asset  prices  relative  to  future  dividends  and 
earnings.14  Investor  myopia  was  one  interpretation,  with  too  great  a  weight  on  near-term 
dividends causing even transitory changes to affect valuation.15 
Using  an  augmented  version  of  this  basic  asset  pricing  framework,  Miles  (1993)  tested 
formally for excessive discounting of future cash-flows using company-level equity price data 
from  the  UK  between  1980  and  1988,  finding  evidence  of  short-termism  over  this  period. 
Similar approaches applied to longer time-series across a range of countries reached broadly 
similar conclusions.16  
Yet, latterly, the quantitative evidence appears, as in the mid-1970s, to have dried up. This 
time  the  efficient  markets  hypothesis  cannot  be  held  responsible,  for  it  has  come  under 
increasingly critical scrutiny. Instead we have seen scraps of evidence drawn from the types 
of  surveys  familiar  from  the  1960s.  For  example,  among  asset  managers,  a  2004  MORI 
survey  of  members  of  the  Investment  Managers  Association  (IMA)  and  the  National 
Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) asked if investment mandates created short-termism. 
A third of NAPF members and two-thirds of IMA members agreed.  
In 2006, a CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) symposium of financial institutions concluded 
“the obsession with short-term results by investors, asset management firms, and corporate 
managers collectively leads to the unintended consequences of destroying long-term value, 
decreasing  market  efficiency,  reducing  investment  returns,  and  impeding  efforts  to 
strengthen corporate governance”. Echoes, here, of Graham’s anti-social voting machine.  
Short-termist behaviour among investors appears to have rubbed-off on companies. Poterba 
and Summers (1995) surveyed Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) at Fortune-1000 firms. They 
found  that  the  discount  rates  applied  to  future  cash-flows  were  around  12%,  much  higher 
than  either  equity  holders’  average  rate  of  return  or  the  return  on  debt.  This  excessive 
discounting implied that some firms were rejecting positive net present value (NPV) projects. 
Echoes, here, of Pigou’s defective telescope. 
Graham,  Harvey  and  Rajgopal  (2005)  surveyed  401  executives.  They  found  three  striking 
results. First, managers would reject a positive-NPV project if that lowered earnings below 
quarterly consensus expectations. Second, over 75% of the sample would give up economic 
value in order to smooth earnings. Third, managers said that this was driven by the desire to 
satisfy investors. Echoes, here, of Marshall’s plum pudding problem.

14  The important papers are LeRoy and Porter (1981), Shiller (1981) and Campbell and Shiller (1988).  
15  Several  other  of  the  empirical  finance  “puzzles”,  including  the  dividend  smoothing  and  serial  correlation 
puzzles, can also potentially be attributed to myopia (Haldane (2010)).

Most  recently,  in  2011  PriceWaterhouseCoopers  conducted  a  survey  of  FTSE-100  and 
250 executives, the majority of which chose a low return option sooner (£250,000 tomorrow) 
rather than a high return later (£450,000 in 3 years). This suggested annual discount rates of 
over  20%.  Recently,  Matthew  Rose,  CEO  of  Burlington  Northern  Santa  Fe  (America’s 
second biggest rail company), expressed frustration at the focus on quarterly earnings when 
locomotives  lasted  for  20  years  and  tracks  for  30  to  40  years.  Echoes,  here,  of  “quarterly 
capitalism”.  
This  evidence  –  anecdotal,  survey,  quantitative  –  is  broadly  consistent  with  popular 
perceptions. Capital market myopia is real. It may be rising. For at least some of the jury, 
however,  it  remains  inconclusive.  In  2010,  Richard  Saunders  (Chief  Executive  of  the  IMA) 
summed  it  up  thus:  “Now  red  lights  start  flashing  for  me  when  people  talk  about  short-
termism, particularly when shareholders feature in the same sentence. What do people mean 
when they claim that shareholders behave in a short-term fashion? And what evidence do 
they have for it? I have yet to hear a convincing answer to either question”. 
Testing for short-termism 
3. 
In  the  quest  for  some  concrete,  quantitative  evidence,  our  test  of  short-termism  uses  the 
forward-looking asset price framework of Miles (1993). A simple example illustrates the basic 
approach to testing myopia and its implications for project choice. 
A simple example 
(a) 
Consider an investment project costing $60. This investment is riskless and pays $10 at the 
end of each of 10 years. The present value of the project is simply the sum of the cash-flows 
discounted by the risk-free rate, r:  
(1) 
 With a discount rate of 9%, the project’s cash-flows are worth $65 today and its NPV is $5. A 
firm or investor offered this project should rationally undertake the investment. 
Short-termism  implies  that  agents  may  discount  “excessively”  future  cash-flows,  over  and 
above the risk-free rate. Denote that short-termism parameter, x. The present value under 
myopic discounting then becomes: 
(2) 
 If x is less that unity, then the project’s cash-flows are discounted too heavily. For example, 
assume x = 0.95 so that one period ahead cash-flows are underestimated by 5%. Even with 
this  modest  degree  of  myopia,  NPV  calculations  are  affected  significantly.  A  $10  return 
received at the end of year 5 should be worth $6.65 today. With myopia, it is worth $5.14. 
Discounted  cash-flows  on  the  project  are  now  worth  $52,  meaning  that  the  NPV  of  the 
project is negative. A myopic investor would walk away from this NPV-worthy project.  
Imagine instead that an investor were making choices based on average payback periods, 
rather  than  NPV.  Under  rational  discounting,  the  project  has  a  payback  period  of  9  years. 
Under myopic discounting, the payback period rises to 15 years. An investor might now think 
twice before investing their money, for their money is committed for almost twice as long. 
So  short-termism  implies  that  projects  with  positive  returns,  or  a  relatively  short  payback, 
may be misperceived as being negative return or having a relatively lengthy payback. These 
projects  would  fail  to  receive  financing.  Investment  and,  ultimately,  growth  would  be  lower

than optimal. In fact, the potential capital misallocation problem is greater still. To see that, 
consider the three projects summarised in Table 1.

In  the  absence  of  short-termism,  project  A  is  selected.  Its  payouts  are  back-loaded  but 
significant; it generates a net excess return of 22%.17 Short-termism hits such long duration 
projects hardest. The impatient investor chooses project C. This project delivers lower cash-
flows  but  these  are  front-loaded.  In  NPV  terms,  the  project  selected  is  the  worst  on  offer, 
whereas the rationally optimal project ranks last. Capital allocation is not just sub-optimally 
low; it is also skewed towards sub-optimally short-duration projects.

Asset pricing 
(b) 
Consider  now  a  formal  model  of  multi-period  equity  price  determination.  Finance  theory 
typically assumes that investors care about both the level and uncertainty of their wealth and 
are  risk  averse.  In  this  world,  agents  require  a  premium  to  invest  in  a  company.  More 
formally, the expected return can be written as the sum of the risk free rate and a company-
specific risk premium for company j:18  
(3) 
 The actual return on an investment is the sum of the capital gain and the dividend yield: 
(4) 
 Assuming  an  efficient  market,  actual  returns  differ  only  from  expected  returns  due  to  a 
forecast error which is uncorrelated with expected returns.19 Using this assumption, we can 
substitute (4) into (3) to give an equation for the equity price.  
                                                 
17  The return is $73 – $60 = $13, divided by the cost of investment. 
18  This is the case  with the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) (Lintner (1965), Sharpe (1964)) and arbitrage 
pricing theory (Ross (1976)). Under the CAPM, for example, the company specific risk premium is equal to the 
company  specific  beta  multiplied  by  the  market  risk  premium 
.  This  means 
19  That is, we assume that 
  BIS central bankers’ speeches

(5) 
 So  the  price  of  the  security  is  simply  the  expected  price  and  dividend  in  the  next  period, 
discounted by the sum of the risk-free rate and the company-specific risk premium. 
By  repeated  substitution,  this  asset  pricing  equation  can  be  written  as  a  generalised  form 
of (1): 
(6) 
 The current share price is a function of future discounted dividend streams and a discounted 
terminal share price, where we have used: 
(7) 
(8) 
  Equation  (7)  says  that  the  expected  company-specific  risk  premium  is  constant  and 
pre-determined based on period t information. Equation (8) says that expectations of future 
risk-free rates are defined by the path of the risk-free forward rate curve observed at time t.  
Equation (6) can be modified with a myopia coefficient to give a generalised version of (2): 
(9) 
 The null hypothesis – no short-termism – implies x = 1. Drawing on evidence across time and 
industrial sectors, it is this restriction we now test.

The core inputs to the analysis are firm-level measures of dividends and equity prices. The 
average  dividend-price  ratio  in  each  industry  segment  is  shown  in  Table  3.  The  mean 
dividend-price ratio across the panel is 2.6%. But there is a fairly significant degree of cross-
sectoral and time-series dispersion. For example, dividend-price ratios are almost twice as 
high in the energy and utilities sector as the health and pharmaceuticals sector. And mean 
dividend-price ratios were two thirds third higher in the 1990s compared to the 1980s.

To estimate (9), we require a selection of quantitative inputs. Taking these in turn: 
Company-specific risk premium 
(a) 
Following  Miles  (1993),  the  company  risk  premium  is  modelled  based  on  firm-specific 
characteristics, in particular the company beta and the level of gearing: 
(10) 
 .21 Betas are estimated using daily return data for firms listed on the S&P 500 
where 
and FTSE, together with daily data for the indices themselves.22 Mean estimated betas are 
shown in Table 4. These average below one for both UK and US firms. As Charts 1 and 2 
illustrate, however, the distribution of betas is fairly wide, with over a third of US firms and 
almost a fifth of UK firms having a beta in excess of unity.

restricted version of (10):  
 22  We exclude observations where the estimated beta is greater than 5 in absolute value, which in practice is 
only 7 firms.

Notes: As for Chart 1 but for UK firms.  
  The  second  component  of  the  firm-specific  discount  factor  is  company  gearing.  This  was 
constructed using annual Thomson Reuters Datastream data for book value per share, the 
number  of  shares  outstanding  and  debt  outstanding.  Other  things  equal,  higher  gearing 
would suggest a higher company-specific discount factor.23 The final element in the firm-level 
discount factor calculation is the risk-free rate. The yield on government securities was used, 
based on data from the Federal Reserve and Bank of England. 
Having estimated (10)  using pooled US and UK regressions over 20  years, a firm-specific 
risk  premium  can  be  calculated.  The  average  premium  across  the  sample  is  5.9%.  As 
Chart 3 shows, both gearing and beta contribute to the company risk premium estimates.  
                                                 
23  The gearing variable is of poorer quality than others in the data, leading to negative gearing observations for 
some  firms.  Any  firm-year  observations  with  negative  gearing  are  excluded  from  the  analysis  (a  total  of 
37 observations).

Expected dividends and prices

The  right-hand-side  of  equation  (9)  defines  the  stream  of  future  dividends  and  terminal 
prices. To generate these, consider a simplified version of (9) which abstracts from discount 
rates, company-specific risk premia and dividends: 
 
(11) 
  
Following  Wickens  (1982),  the  rational  expectation  t+N  periods  ahead  are  formed  on  the 
basis of information available at time t. For each company j, these expectations differ from 
the realised values by a forecast error (

the  company-specific  excess  forecasting  errors.  In  the  estimation,  lagged  share  prices, 
lagged dividends per share and lagged earnings per share are used as instruments for future 
dividends and equity prices. These are known at time t but are uncorrelated with the error 
term. Five lags of each variable (price, dividends, earnings) are used as instruments.

Generating estimates of short-termism 
(c) 
Given  estimates  of  company  beta  and  gearing,  risk-free  rates  and  the  instrumented 
variables,  equation  (9)  can  be  estimated  to  generate  estimates  of  the  short-termism 
parameter, x. This was achieved using non-linear least squares on a set of cross-sectional 
regressions for each of the years 1985 to 2004.24 
Chart 4 shows point estimates of x for each of these years. Short-termism estimates which 
are statistically significantly below unity (at the 5% confidence level) are shown in red. The 
simple average of x across the 20-year period is very close to one (0.9935). On the face of it, 
this  does  not  suggest  that  short-termism  has  been  a  particular  problem  among  this  cross-
section of firms.

But this masks some important within-period variation. In 13 of the 20 years, x is lower than 1. 
And in 9 of these years, x is statistically significantly below unity. Moreover, there is evidence of 
a rising tide of myopia: 8 of these 9 years occur in the final decade of the sample. 
To illustrate, Table 5 shows point estimates of x over two decadal sub-samples (1985–1994 and 
1995–2004)  and  over  the  full  sample.  Estimates  are  significantly  below  unity  in  the  second 
sub-sample, but not the first. The point estimate of x over the second sub-sample is 0.94.25

premium and varying the effects of taxes. These did not alter significantly the empirical estimates.

Table 6 shows estimates of x over the same three samples on a sectoral basis. It echoes the 
message  from  Table  5.  There  is  statistically  significant  evidence  of  short-termism  in  the 
second half of the sample for all seven industrial sectors. And in all of these sectors except 
health and materials, x is lower in the second half of the sample than the first – in those two 
sectors x is below unity throughout the sample.  
Although short-termism appears to be a consistent theme across industrial sectors, there are 
nonetheless  some  interesting  patterns  in  the  degree  of  short-termism  across  sectors.  For 
example, the financial sector does not appear especially short-termist over the full sample. 
By contrast, the health and materials sectors exhibit short-termism throughout.

 Short-termism and public policy  
5. 
These  tests  of  short-termism  point  to  two  key  conclusions.  First,  there  is  statistically 
significant evidence of short-termism in the pricing of companies’ equities. This is true across 
all industrial sectors. Moreover, there is evidence of short-termism having increased over the 
recent past. Myopia is mounting. 
Second,  estimates  of  short-termism  are  economically  as  well  as  statistically  significant. 
Empirical  evidence  points  to  excess  discounting  of  between  5%  and  10%  per  year.  To 
illustrate the impact of this on investment choice, consider the earlier project with an annual 
income stream of $10.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches

Chart  6  shows  the  present  value  of  those  income  streams  under  three  counter-factual 
assumptions:  rational  discounting;  myopic  discounting  –  lower  bound  (5%);  and  myopic 
discounting – upper bound (10%). The cumulative impact is fairly dramatic. Ten-year ahead 
cash-flows under rational discounting are valued similarly to between six-year (lower bound) 
and  four-year  (upper  bound)  ahead  cash-flows  under  myopic  discounting.  The  long  is 
shortened.

  Notes: The chart assumes $10 is paid at the end of 
each  year.  The  rational  discount  rate  used  is 
1.085.  
 
Notes: The cumulative NPV of $10 cash-flows rises to 
$61  in  year  9  under  rational  discounting.  With  mild 
myopia  (x=0.95)  it  only  passes  $60  at  year  15.  With 
severe  myopia  (x=0.90)  the  investor  calculates  that 
payback is not achieved.

Notes: The number in the table refers to the first year that a $10 cash-flow falls below 10%, 1% and 0.1% of its 
actual value in present value terms. The rational discount uses an average risk free rate from our cross sectional 
data sample (1.085).  
 
This  is  illustrated  even  more  clearly  if  we  consider  payback  periods.  Under  rational 
discounting, payback occurs in 9 years (Chart  7). Under upper bound myopic discounting, 
the  investor  today  would  erroneously  assume  that  payback  would  never  be  made.  These 
differences have the potential to alter radically project choice. The net present value of this

project  evaluated  over  50  years  falls  from  $56  under  rational  discounting  to  a  loss  of 
$11 under  extreme  myopia.  In  other  words,  a  NPV-positive  project  would  be  resoundingly 
rejected. 
To put the point more starkly, Table 7 asks at what point in the future the residual value of a 
future  cash-flow  hits  a  level  of  10%,  1%  and  0.1%  of  its  face  value,  under  rational  and 
myopic discounting. Under rational discounting, cash-flows even 50 years ahead retain more 
than  1%  of  their  face  value.  Under  strong  myopic  discounting,  this  residual  threshold  is 
reached after 25 years. Virtually zero weight – less than 1000th of the face value of the cash-
flow  –  is  placed  on  projects  with  income  streams  much  beyond  35  years.  The  long  is 
dramatically shortened. 
This  is  a  market  failure.  It  would  tend  to  result  in  investment  being  too  low  and  in  long-
duration projects suffering disproportionately. This might include projects with high build or 
sunk costs, including infrastructure and high-tech investments. These projects are often felt 
to yield the highest long-term (private and social) returns and hence offer the biggest boost to 
future growth. That makes short-termism a public policy issue. 
But  what  would  be  an  appropriate  public  policy  response  to  this  capital  market  failure?  A 
number of proposals have been suggested by various authors. These include: 
(a) 
intensive  approach  would 
Transparency: The lightest touch approach would be to require greater disclosures 
by financial and non-financial firms of their long-term intentions – for example, their 
long-term performance, strategy and compensation practices.26 For financial firms, 
this  might  include  metrics  of  portfolio  churn.  This  could  be  accompanied  by  a 
programme  of  educating  managers,  investors  and  advisors  of  their  fiduciary 
responsibilities. 
Governance:  A  more 
involve  acting  directly  on 
shareholder  incentives  through  their  voting  rights.  For  example,  fiduciary  duties 
could  be  expanded  to  recognise  explicitly  long-term  objectives.27  More  concretely, 
shareholder  rights  could  be  enhanced  for  long-term  investors,  perhaps  with  a 
duration-dependent sliding scale of voting rights.28 
Contract  Design:  There  have  been  various  attempts  over  the  past  few  years  to 
make  compensation  contracts  more  sensitive  to  long-term  performance  and  risk. 
This includes employment contracts conditioned on long-term performance, or with 
deferral or clawback. Changes in the compensation instrument can also help – for 
example, remunerating in equity is better than in cash and remunerating in junior or 
convertible debt might be better than either.29 
Taxation/Subsidies:  Authors  have  suggested  a  variety  of  ways 
in  which 
government could penalise short-duration holdings of securities, or incentivise long-
duration  holdings,  using  tax  and  /  or  subsidy  measures.  These  measures  differ in 
detail,  but  the  underlying  principle  is  to  link  them  to  the  duration  of  an  investor’s 
holdings or the length or nature of a company’s investment.30

Some of these initiatives have been tried and tested in differing degrees, at different times 
and in different countries. They have not obviously arrested the short-termism trend. It might 
be time to increase the level of policy ambition if the telescope is to be corrected, the voting
