Mr Meyer gives his views on the sustainability of
growth and on monetary policy in the United States
Remarks by Mr Laurence H Meyer, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve
System,  before  the  National  Economists  Club  and  the  Society  of  Government  Economists,
Washington, D.C. on 20 January 2000.
 Economic performance over the past several years has been exceptional. The economy is about to set a
record  for  the  longest  expansion.  Economic  growth  has  been  proceeding  at  a  rate  that  is  close  to
double  what  was  generally  viewed  as  the  long-term  trend  when  this  expansion  began.  Inflation
remains modest, despite a decline in the unemployment rate to levels that many would have expected
to trigger a significant acceleration in prices.
But if you are a forecaster or a policymaker, rather than an economic historian, you must focus on the
next  chapter.  The  fundamental  question  today,  it  seems  to  me,  is  whether  the  current  set  of
macroeconomic  conditions  -  specifically,  the  growth  of  output  and  the  unemployment  rate  -  is
sustainable - that is, consistent with stable, low inflation. If it is, the expansion could continue on its
current path, unless disturbed by some shock or policy mistake. Otherwise, the challenge for monetary
policy is to guide the economy to a sustainable path while preserving low inflation.
This  challenge  is  heightened  by  the  unusual  degree  of  uncertainty  about  the  limits  of  capacity  and
potential  growth,  related  in  part  to  ongoing  structural  changes  in  the  economy.  Concerns  have  also
been raised about potential imbalances in some sectors, for example, about the sustainability of equity
prices, the personal saving rate, the current account deficit, and debt burdens. These concerns about
sustainability  and  the  challenges  they  pose  for  monetary  policy  are  the  focus  of  my  remarks  this
afternoon.
Let me remind you that, as always, the views I express are my own. I am not speaking on behalf of
either the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).
Varieties of landings
In figure 1, I present four plausible scenarios for future growth. Each has a quite different implication
for both the outlook and policy. In each case the economy faces an initial gap between actual output
(the dashed line) and potential output (the solid line). Such a gap is typical of conditions that follow a
recession. During the expansion phase, at least for a period, growth in production typically exceeds the
growth in capacity, so that the gap between actual and potential output is closed gradually.
For the moment, I shall focus exclusively on the concerns about sustainability related to the balance
between  aggregate  supply  and  demand.  Later  I  shall  turn  to  concerns  about  imbalances  in  equity
prices, the personal saving rate, the current account, and the household debt burden.
A soft landing
Figure  1.A  depicts  a  soft  landing  scenario,  the  graceful  transition  from  the  initial  output  gap  to  a
sustainable growth path at full employment. A soft landing occurs if, as the level of output approaches
potential,  the  growth  of  actual  output  slows  to  the  growth  of  potential  output  just  as  actual  output
reaches potential. The line for potential output is, in effect, the runway. The line for actual output is
like the path of a plane coming in for a soft landing - at least if you stand on your head while looking
at the chart!
Steady inflation is generally one of the signs of sustainability. A simple model of inflation dynamics is
that changes in inflation are induced by excess aggregate demand or supply, as reflected in the output
1

gap. When actual output rises above potential, according to this model, the resulting excess aggregate
demand leads to rising inflation.
In the short run, supply shocks - including both relative price shocks and changes in trend productivity
- can also affect inflation dynamics. But these effects are temporary. Ultimately, inflation dynamics
will  be  driven  by  the  output  gap.  At  some  point  in  any  expansion,  therefore,  a  soft  landing  is  the
preferred path to preserve a healthy expansion. Such a slowdown in growth is desirable because the
alternative is higher inflation - indeed, continually rising inflation. Looking back, most recessions have
resulted  from  attempts  by  the  policy  authorities  -  yes,  the  Fed  -  to  reverse  increases  in  inflation
generated by overheating.
A reverse soft landing
Figure 1.B depicts an alternative scenario in which the above-trend growth in the expansion phase has
moved the economy beyond the point of its sustainable capacity to produce. Policymakers in this case
BIS Review 5/2000

failed to execute a soft landing. What could they do in this case to best ensure the continuation of a
healthy expansion? The answer is to engineer the closest possible approximation to a soft landing, one
in  which  we  glide  to  potential  beginning  from  a  position  initially  above  rather  than  from  below
potential. Because the convergence to potential is from above rather than below, I call this a “reverse”
soft landing.
In this case, because the economy is already operating beyond its sustainable capacity, the economy
may  not  be  able  to  avoid  some  acceleration  in  inflation  as  policymakers  try  to  engineer  the  soft
landing. Therefore, the return to the potential output path has to be achieved in a sufficiently timely
fashion to minimize any increase in inflation during the transition.  Also, in the reverse  soft landing
case,  growth  must  slow,  not just to  trend  but  to  below trend in  order  to  close  the  output  gap.  As  a
result, the unemployment rate must rise during the transition to full employment in this case. Hence,
whereas the soft landing outcome in figure 1.A involves a stabilization of the unemployment rate at its
low point and of inflation near its recent low, in the reverse soft landing case depicted in figure 1.B,
both inflation and unemployment rates are likely to rise during the transition.
The best-case scenario: supply meets demand
The first two scenarios I have described assume that demand has to adjust to a steady supply path to
achieve sustainability. There are natural equilibrating mechanisms, as well as policy adjustments, that
encourage such adjustment in demand relative to supply. An alternative scenario is that supply adjusts
to demand. This case is depicted in figure 1.C in which the growth of potential increases just as output
threatens to push beyond potential. In this scenario, the runway has fortuitously landed on the plane, as
it were. If this scenario describes the current episode, then the economy can continue to grow at 4%,
the unemployment rate can remain near 4%, and inflation can remain steady at its prevailing rate.
This scenario may seem farfetched. But it has the advantage of incorporating the role of supply-side as
well  as  demand-side  forces  that  appear  to  be  at  work  in  this  expansion,  and  it  would  at  least  help
explain  the  stability  of  inflation  at  prevailing  growth  and  unemployment  rates.  Indeed,  a  possible
decline in the NAIRU and, especially, an increase in the growth rate of potential output appear to be
essential elements of this expansion. Still, even if we take into account the supply-side changes, we
should not expect a perfect balancing between supply and demand.

The worse-case scenario: hard landings
The  worst-case  alternative  to  a  soft  landing,  to  continue  the  analogy,  is  often  referred  to  as  a  hard
landing. Despite, or perhaps because of, the recent exceptional performance of the US economy, some
see a growing danger of a hard landing.
A hard landing might seem like an oxymoron. A crash is a crash, after all, not a landing. But the key to
a landing is that it is required to ensure sustainability of an expansion. A soft landing is the preferred
course to ensuring a healthy, sustainable expansion, if it can be executed. A reverse soft landing is the
second-best  option.  Otherwise,  a  hard  landing  may  be  unavoidable,  despite  the  best  efforts  of
policymakers.  The  upside  of  a  hard  landing  is  that  it  contributes  to  reversing  imbalances  and,
afterwards,  allows  policymakers  to  aim  once  again  at  achieving  a  healthy,  sustainable  expansion,
ultimately combining full employment, maximum sustainable growth, and price stability.
It  is  useful  to  distinguish  two  broad  classes  of  hard  landings.  The  first  involves  the  reversal  of  an
imbalance  between  aggregate  supply  and  aggregate  demand.  The  classic  example  is  the  boom-bust
scenario. The second class involves the unwinding of sector or market imbalances that either initiate a
downturn  in  the  economy  or  aggravate  a  downturn  that  would  otherwise  have  occurred.  A  classic
example  of  this  genre  is  a  stock  market  correction.  I  will  focus  first  on  the  boom-bust  scenario  to
complete my classification of paths to sustainable combinations of growth and the output gap.
In  the  boom-bust  scenario,  depicted  in  figure  1.D,  above-trend  output  growth  during  the  expansion
ultimately pushes output well beyond potential for a persistent period. The resulting overheating puts
upward  pressure  on  inflation.  The  monetary  policy  response  to  reverse  the  inflation  often  yields  a
decline in output, as depicted here, resulting in a period of economic slack and a reversal of the rise in
inflation. This is the scenario from which we draw the lesson that timely, typically preemptive, policy
restraint  to  avoid  the  excesses  of  a  boom  results  in  longer  expansions  and  avoids  unnecessary
fluctuations in both output and inflation.
Where are we relative to potential and do we need to land?
To identify whether the initial conditions today correspond to those in one of the panels of figure 1, we
have to assess where output is relative to its potential and whether growth is above or below trend.
This assignment is more difficult than usual because structural changes of uncertain dimension may
have raised both the level and the growth rate of potential output.
BIS Review 5/2000

There is, for example, a consensus that the NAIRU has declined since the early 1990s. That decline
translates into an increase in the level of potential output at any given time or a decline in the output
gap for a given level of output.
There is also a consensus that the rate of growth of potential output is higher today than during the
twenty  years  preceding  this  expansion.  However,  the  degree  to  which  these  two  parameters  have
changed is not a settled issue. In particular, some think that the rapid growth and low unemployment
rate of the past two years represent the economy’s new equilibrium (case 1.C), but others believe that
the economy has still been running ahead of potential recently, despite structural changes. We should
not be surprised that a period of structural change would also be one of heightened uncertainty about
key parameters, such as the NAIRU and trend growth.
Table  1  offers  various  estimates  of  the  NAIRU  and  trend  growth,  drawn  from  researchers,
model-based  forecasts,  assumptions  incorporated  in  government  budget  projections,  and  surveys  of
economic forecasters. These estimates suggest that actual output is above potential (the unemployment
rate is below the NAIRU) and that actual output growth has been above trend growth of potential.
Despite the uncertainties, the consensus estimates of the NAIRU and the growth of potential give us a
hint  about  what  type  of  landing  we  should  be  aiming  for  and  which  of  the  scenarios  depicted  in
figure 1 best describe the economy’s initial conditions and prospects. The answer, it seems to me, is
that  no  scenario  in  figure  1  does  justice  to  the  complex  forces  that  have  been  in  play  during  this
expansion. I believe that the prevailing macro configuration is best described by some combination of
figures 1.B, 1.C, or 1.D. That is, even after we incorporate the estimated decline in the NAIRU and the
higher  rate  of  growth  of  potential  (as  reflected  in  figure  1.C),  output  is  above  potential  and  output
growth exceeds that of potential (as depicted in figures 1.B and 1.D). If output were above potential,
we  still  would  not  know  whether  the  outcome  would  be  a  soft  (1.B)  or  a  hard  (1.D)  landing.  To
complete  the  picture,  we  also  have  to  rely  on  the  temporary  disinflationary  effects  of  favorable
relative-price  shocks  and  the  increase  in  the  productivity  trend  that  have  allowed  the  economy  to
operate, for a while, beyond potential without suffering inflationary consequences.
Hard landings associated with the unwinding of sector and market imbalances
Much  of  the  recent  concern  about  the  sustainability  of  this  expansion  is,  nevertheless,  not  related
directly  to  the  balance  between  aggregate  demand  and  aggregate  supply.  Rather  these  concerns  are
related to perceived imbalances in particular sectors or markets. Most notably, attention has focused
on equity prices, the personal saving rate, the current account deficit, and debt burdens. The unifying
theme  among  this  class  of  imbalances  is  that  they  typically  arise  during  an  expansion,  often  as  the
result  of  changing  attitudes  toward  the  perceived  risk  in  the  economy  or  as  a  result  of  increased
willingness  to  accept  risk.  Many,  though  not  all,  of  these  imbalances  are  financial  in  nature  -  for
example,  increases  in  leverage  or  declines  in  liquidity  and  other  margins  of  safety.  These
developments typically play a role in supporting or financing expansions. The resulting imbalances do
not  typically  induce  a  downturn  by  spontaneously  reversing.  But  they  may  act  to  magnify  any
downward  forces  that  hit  the  economy,  increasing  the  depth  and  perhaps  duration  of  downturns.
Hence, these factors play an important role in both phases of the boom-bust scenario.
I associate many of the second class of hard landing scenarios with the work of a former colleague and
friend, Hyman Minsky, who died in 1996. He emphasized the development of financial vulnerabilities
in expansions and their contribution to serious recessions. In his view, serious recessions are typically
the result of a coincidence of adverse shocks on an already vulnerable economy. Minsky emphasized
the  role  of  vulnerabilities  arising  from  financial  imbalances,  including  excessive  debt  burdens  or
increases in the price of risky assets relative to safe assets.
Historical perspective on market or sector imbalances
Figure 2 offers a historical perspective on equity prices, the personal saving rate, the current account,
and debt burden. In each case, I identify a preferred measure of each variable, scaling it relative to an
appropriate measure of output or income. I want to emphasize that we cannot reach a judgment from

these charts about whether the perceived imbalance is real and serious, but we can at least understand
why concerns have been raised in each case.
The chart for the stock market, figure 2.A, shows the price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P500  index,
based on the trailing four-quarter earnings. The current p/e ratio of about 32 compares with an average
of 16 since 1957 and a high before this expansion of 22.3 in August 1987. The personal saving rate,
charted  in  figure  2.B,  has  declined  in  this  episode  to  a  record  low.  The  current  account  balance,
pictured in figure 2.C, is measured as the ratio to nominal gross domestic product (GDP). This ratio
has  also  declined  to  a  record  low.  In  figure  2.D,  I  have  charted  the  ratio  of  debt  service  costs  to
disposable income for the household sector, a preferred measure of the household debt burden. It has
been rising since the mid-1990s but remains below the peak reached in the mid-1980s.

As I noted, none of these diagrams definitively demonstrate that there is an unsustainable imbalance.
The point of the exercise is to show why some have worried that there might be. It would take a more
detailed analysis than time permits to reach an informed judgment about the risks in each case. And
when we were done with this more detailed analysis, we could reasonably expect that we would still
be left with considerable uncertainty.
Common sources of recent developments
What I do want to focus on this afternoon are possible common sources for the developments pictured
in  figure  2  and  the  relation  of  any  imbalance  between  aggregate  supply  and  demand  to  those
developments.
There  are,  I  believe,  some  common  sources  of  the  developments  pictured  in  figure  2.  First,  these
variables are all cyclically sensitive. During expansions, equity prices tend to rise, although they often
decline before a downturn in the economy. Discerning a consistent pattern for the saving rate during
an  expansion  from  the  chart  is  more  difficult:  too  many  other  factors  play  a  role.  But  regression
analysis  indicates that  the  saving  rate tends  to  move  countercyclically.  The current  account  balance
tends to deteriorate if the expansion in the United States outpaces that abroad, as has been the case in
BIS Review 5/2000

recent years. After some point, the debt burden tends to increase sharply during expansions, although
it  often  turns  before  a  recession.  But  this  cyclical  expansion  is  not  ordinary.  It  is  exceptional.  The
unemployment rate, for example, has declined to a 30-year low. By some estimates, the output gap is
the widest since the early-1970s. The duration of the expansion is about to set a record. It is therefore
not surprising that cyclically sensitive variables are behaving exceptionally by historical standards.
Second, the composition of output gains in this episode has also contributed to the patterns in figure 2.
Private  domestic  demand  typically  is  the  driver  of  expansions,  but  its  contribution  has  been  even
greater than usual this time. The direct contribution of federal government spending and tax changes,
reflected in the swing in the federal budget from deficit to surplus, has been a net drag on growth. The
weakness of our trading partners and the crises among emerging market economies contributed to the
sharpness of the decline in net exports. So the pace of domestic private demand has been even stronger
than the growth in overall output. Private domestic spending has been driven, in part, by the wealth
effect arising from higher equity prices, a situation that also helps to explain much of the decline in the
personal saving rate, and has been financed by a higher household debt and by the tapping of foreign
saving.
Also the two types of imbalances - an imbalance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply and
sector or market imbalances - could be connected. Consider a situation in which growth is above trend
and  output  moves  beyond  capacity.  If  investors  misread  these  developments  as  sustainable  and,
therefore, extrapolate the exceptional conditions, exceptional and perhaps unsustainable movements in
equity  prices,  the  saving  rate,  and  debt  burden  might  be  encouraged.  Alternatively,  a  rise  in  equity
prices  that  outstrips  fundamentals  might  contribute  to  a  pace  of  private  domestic  demand  that
ultimately takes output beyond capacity; in this case, the market or sector imbalance would be what
contributed to the aggregate demand-supply imbalance. It also seems quite possible, indeed likely, that
both these directions could operate simultaneously and reinforce each other. Finally, market or sector
imbalances  could  possibly  rise  to  worrisome  proportions  in  the  absence  of  an  imbalance  between
aggregate demand and supply.
This  analysis  leaves  us  with  four  possible  combinations:  (1)  simultaneous  imbalances  in  both
aggregate  demand/supply  and  market/sector  variables;  (2)  simultaneous  balance  in  each  class;
(3) aggregate  demand/supply  imbalance  accompanied  by  balance  in  market/sector  variables;  and
(4) aggregate demand/supply balance accompanied by market/sector imbalances. There are clearly a
wide  variety  of  opinions  about  which  of  these  combinations  best  describes  the  current  situation.
Indeed, many observers, including myself, are uncertain about which combination best fits the current
picture.
The problem in assessing the risks associated with market/sector imbalances is not only determining
whether or not prevailing levels of these variables constitute an imbalance in the first place but also
figuring out the circumstances and time frame over which any true imbalance might be unwound. In
addition,  the  effects  on  the  economy  as  a  given  imbalance  is  unwound  will  depend  importantly  on
interactions with other imbalances and with events that trigger the unwinding of the imbalance, as well
as  on  the  policy  response.  For  example,  a  stock  market  correction  is  typically  triggered  by  some
adverse event so that the effect on the economy will be the combined effects of the triggering event
and the stock market decline. A decline in the stock market might also, for example, reduce confidence
in  the  US  economy  and  reduce  the  willingness  of  foreigners  to  accumulate  the  increment  in  US
liabilities associated with the current account deficit. And the net effect will also depend on the policy
response  to  the  adverse  effects  of  the  unwinding  of  any  imbalances.  As  a  result  of  these
considerations, simple multiplier exercises, such as the effect on the economy of a given percentage
decline in equity prices, probably tell more about the econometric model used than about prospects for
the economy.
The challenge for monetary policy
The most important of the perceived imbalances I have discussed today is, in my view, the possibility
of  an  overheated  economy.  In  three  of  the  four  combinations  of  aggregate  demand/supply  and
market/sector  imbalances,  it  seems  to  me  that  the  best  approach  would  be  to  focus  directly  on  the

aggregate  demand/supply  imbalance  and  allow  the  indirect  effects  of  such  a  policy  to  mitigate  any
other imbalances. In addition, any other imbalances are more likely to grow to worrisome proportions
during an unsustainable boom and are more likely to unwind in a disruptive manner if confronted by
rising  inflation,  sharply  higher  interest  rates  in  response  to  higher  inflation,  and  a  subsequent
recession. As a result, my guess is that if we avoid the boom-bust scenario, we shall have avoided the
most serious of the other imbalances or at least will be in a better position to absorb and respond to the
unwinding of other possible imbalances.
That leaves the  possibility  that  there  might  be  cases  when  we  face  market/sector  imbalances  in  the
absence of any aggregate demand/supply imbalance. In such a case, the level and growth of output are
sustainable in the sense that they are not putting pressure on inflation; but this aggregate balance might
be threatened subsequently by a spontaneous unwinding of a market/sector imbalance. Alternatively,
the depth and duration of a downturn in response to some future adverse shock might be aggravated by
the  unwinding  market/sector imbalances.  What  role  can  and  should  monetary  policy  play  in  such  a
case? Policymakers will, I expect, be reluctant to undermine macroeconomic performance in the short
run in an attempt to unwind a perceived market/sector imbalance that might not be serious or might
unwind  in  a  gradual  and  nondisruptive  fashion  on  its  own.  Furthermore,  it  is  not  obvious  how  to
unwind an excessive debt burden, to raise the personal saving rate, or to narrow the current account
deficit in a sustainable way through monetary policy.
As  a  result,  monetary  policy,  in  my  view,  needs  to  focus  on  achieving  balance  between  aggregate
supply  and  aggregate  demand.  In  pursuing  this  course,  monetary  policy  is  confronted  by  two
competing challenges. The first is to allow the economy to realize the benefits of any decline in the
NAIRU and any increase in trend growth. Supporting maximum sustainable growth is very much the
business of monetary policy. But achieving maximum sustainable growth also is about ensuring the
sustainability of an expansion and hence avoiding overheating. This is the second challenge today. I
view the efforts of the FOMC as precisely focused on balancing these considerations.
