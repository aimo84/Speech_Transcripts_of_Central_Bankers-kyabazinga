Prompt Corrective Action: An Essential Element of Financial Stability Framework 
- Viral V Acharya, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India1 
Remarks delivered at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay – 12th October 2018 
 
Abstract 
 This  talk  explains  why  the  Prompt  Corrective  Action  (PCA)  framework  of  the 
Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI)  is  an  essential  element  of  its  financial  stability 
framework. It lays out the case for structured early intervention and resolution by 
regulators  for  banks  that  become  under-capitalised  due  to  poor  asset  quality  or 
vulnerable  due  to  loss  of  profitability.  Detailing  the  mandatory  and  discretionary 
actions  under  the  RBI's  Revised  PCA  framework,  it  compares  and  contrasts  these 
with  the  PCA  framework  operating  in  the  United  States.  Finally,  it  documents 
empirically how Indian banks under the PCA framework are being restored back to 
health  through  better  capitalisation,  preservation  of  capital,  and  provisioning  for 
losses. 
 I  would  like  to  thank  the  Indian  Institute  of  Technology  (IIT),  Bombay,  and  in  particular, 
Professor Pushpa Trivedi, who inspired me to pursue Economics and Finance, for inviting me 
back to IIT, my undergraduate alma mater. It is always an occasion of great pride and immense 
satisfaction for me to return to the Powai campus and be reminded of what I learnt here – the 
importance of identifying big problems to solve, approaching them with an analytical mindset, 
scything  through  seemingly  attractive  but  incomplete  fixes,  and  in  the  process,  discovering 
durable solutions that address the root causes underlying the problems.   
About  thirteen  months  back  on  the  7th  of  September,  2017,  I  spoke  at  the  8th  R  K  Talwar 
Memorial  Lecture  about  “The  Unfinished  Agenda:  Restoring  Public  Sector  Bank  Health  in 
India,” wherein, I touched upon three themes:  
(i) 
How  under-capitalised  banking  systems  engage  in  ever-greening  of  the  distressed 
borrowers (“zombie lending”), as witnessed in the United States during the Savings 
                                                            
1  I  am  grateful  to  Governor  Dr.  Urjit  R.  Patel  and  Deputy  Governor  N.  S.  Vishwanathan  for  their  constant 
encouragement, feedback and guidance. I also thank Vaibhav Chaturvedi for his excellent support throughout the 
preparation of this speech; R Gurumurthy, Jagan Mohan, B Nethaji, Sooraj Menon and Vineet Srivastava of the 
Reserve Bank of India; and, my co-authors, Sascha Steffen of Frankfurt School of Management and Finance and Lea 
Steinruecke of University of Mannheim.

and Loan (S&L) crisis of 1980’s, Japan in the 1990’s, and the Eurozone following the 
global financial crisis; 
 
(ii)  What steps the Reserve Bank of India had undertaken to address the stressed assets 
problem of Indian banks, viz., the creation of Central Repository of Information on 
Large  Credits  (CRILC)  in  early  2014;  the  Asset  Quality  Review  in  2015;  and 
reference  of  the  largest,  aged  non-performing  assets  (NPAs)  to  the  Insolvency  and 
Bankruptcy Code (IBC) under the powers bestowed upon the Bank by promulgation 
of the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance 2017 (since notified as an Act); 
and, finally,  
 
The  need  for  the  Government  of  India  (GoI)  to  meet  the  recapitalisation  needs  of 
public sector banks (PSBs), in their current ownership structure or otherwise.  
(iii) 
Since then, the GoI has announced a recapitalisation package for PSBs in October 2017 of INR 
2.11  trillion,  comprising  INR  1.53  trillion  of  government  capital  infusion  and  balance  to  be 
raised  from  market  funding,  by  March  2019.  Equally  importantly,  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India 
issued  a  circular  on  the  12th  of  February,  2018  for  the  resolution  of  stressed  assets,  which 
employs the IBC reference as its lynchpin for resolution and is aimed at improving the credit 
culture in both borrowers and lenders. 
Another significant step has been taken by the Reserve Bank of India in parallel which has been 
somewhat  under-appreciated,  viz.,  the  imposition  of  Prompt  Corrective  Action  (PCA)  on  a 
number  of  banks  whose  capital,  asset  quality  and/or  profitability  do  not  meet  pre-specified 
thresholds. Today, I wish to explain why PCA is an essential element of the Reserve Bank’s (and 
more generally, of a banking supervisor’s) financial stability framework. 
 Loss-absorption Role of Bank Capital  
Before I discuss the Prompt Corrective Action approach, it would be useful to briefly talk about 
the critical role of bank capital in relation to the process of resolution of stressed banks.  
In its simplest form, a bank balance-sheet has assets on the left hand side of the balance-sheet, 
and liabilities on the right hand side in the form of equity capital and deposits (and other forms of 
debt liabilities such as unsecured bonds, and wholesale finance such as inter-bank liabilities or 
short-term commercial paper).   
Equity  capital  is  the  primary  loss-absorption  buffer  –  means  of  protection  –  against  the  asset 
losses  of  a  bank.  It  is  meant  to  be  at  levels  high  enough  to  absorb  unanticipated  losses  with 
enough margin so as to inspire confidence and enable the bank to continue as a going concern, in 
particular, without passing on losses to bank creditors. Once the capital level is fully consumed 
by the deteriorating financials, it exposes the unsecured creditors, including depositors, to bear 
 2 
the losses. While the deposits typically are insured up to a certain level, economic history shows 
that  more  often  than  not  the  ultimate  costs  of  paying  off  all  deposits  fall  on  the  sovereign, 
especially in the case of large, complex and inter-connected banks.  
Capital  constraints  at  a  wider,  systemic  level  also  impact  the  resolution  of  weak  banks.  The 
United States experience, empirically documented by Granja, Matvos and Seru (2017), shows 
that an optimal bidding strategy of a healthier bank – a potential acquirer, which may value the 
weaker bank for its franchise value from deposits, gets adversely impacted if it is itself poorly 
capitalized. In such a scenario, the overall value realization for the weak bank goes down.  The 
poor capitalization of potential acquirers can also drive a wedge between their willingness and 
ability to pay for a failed bank. In this manner, bank capital being at healthy levels also has a 
system-wide  loss-absorption  role  by  helping  sell  weak  banks  to  healthy  ones  in  an  efficient 
manner. 
 
Given this criticality of bank capital in absorbing losses, it is natural why minimum bank capital 
requirements are in place globally and why capital becomes one of the most important factors for 
supervisors to monitor. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, there has been a complete 
overhaul of the international regime for minimum regulatory capital requirements of banks, as 
enshrined in the revised Basel norms, viz., Basel-III.  
The goal of Basel III is to raise the quality, consistency and transparency of the capital base of 
banks to withstand unanticipated losses and to strengthen the overall risk coverage of the capital 
framework. In addition to revising the minimum capital ratio requirements for credit risk, Basel 
III  also  introduced  a  capital  conservation  buffer  (CCB)  and  a  countercyclical  capital  buffer.  
CCB is designed to ensure that banks build up a capital buffer outside periods of financial stress 
that  can  be  drawn  down  when  banks  face  financial  (systemic  or  idiosyncratic)  stress.  Banks 
which draw down their capital conservation buffer during a stressed period are required to have a 
definite plan to replenish the buffer and face capital distribution constraints. The objective of the 
countercyclical  capital  buffer  is  to  use  capital  as  a  macro-prudential  instrument  aimed  at 
protecting  the  banking  sector  from  periods  of  excess  aggregate  credit  growth,  that  have  often 
been associated with the build-up of system-wide risk.  
In  this  regard,  it  is  instructive  to  note  that  the  minimum  bank  capital  ratio  (to  suitably  risk-
weighted  assets)  required  to  be  held  under  the  Basel  norms  is  only  a  floor.    Since  the  global 
financial  crisis,  many  countries  require  their  banks  to  hold  capital  at  higher  levels,  as  shown 
below.  Further,  in  other  major  jurisdictions  like  the  US  and  the  UK,  effective  capital 
requirements  tend  to  be  even  higher  on  account  of  several  add-ons;  for  instance,  in  the  US, 
higher leverage ratio (put simply, bank capital to unweighted assets ratio) and the stress tests – 
annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis & Review (CCAR) – also push up the effective capital 
requirements beyond Basel requirements for systemically important and/or large banks.

While this view of bank capital focuses on its benefits in the form of loss-absorption adequacy at 
individual bank and systemic level, there is an equally important incentive role played by bank 
capital that is worthy of discussion.

Incentive Role of Bank Capital 
Let me now explain why it becomes imperative for bank supervisors to intervene in a weak bank 
much before the capital is completely eroded.  Conceptually, there are at least two reasons why 
the world over banks that make losses to the point of being under-capitalised do not recapitalise, 
or are not recapitalised, promptly.   
6.0 to 13.0 
8.0 to 19.0 
12.0 
4.5 
6.0 
First, while private banks typically hold greater capital than required by regulatory requirements, 
shareholders are reluctant to inject capital once the capital is eroded by losses as it gets primarily 
deployed  in  stabilising  bank  liabilities.    To  compensate  for  this  wealth  transfer  for  injecting 
capital, shareholders require a much higher rate of return than when banks are better capitalised, 
but such high required returns may render banking activity unprofitable to pursue. This is the 
well-known “debt overhang” problem, studied extensively in financial economics (Myers, 1977).  
Secondly,  when  banks  become  under-capitalised  en  masse  or  are  government-owned  to  start 
with, it is often thought that recapitalisation should occur swiftly given the attendant real and 
systemic risk costs of not recapitalising banks – costs that a government should internalise.  In 
practice,  however,  banking  sectors  are  sometimes  “too  big  to  save”  relative  to  the  size  of 
government  balance-sheets.  Even  when  that  is  not  so,  governments  may  themselves  be 
financially constrained: bank recapitalisations must earn effective returns that exceed the costs of 
 4 
raising additional finance (usually additional borrowings) or from cutting back on other fiscal 
expenditures. Hence, it is quite common, even for government-owned under-capitalised banks to 
take a while to get adequately recapitalised, if at all. 
Regardless of the reason for the under-capitalisation of banks to persist, what is observed is that 
creditors  of  under-capitalised  banks  are  not  only  offered  off-balance  sheet  government 
guarantees, notably deposit insurance, but also implicit guarantees to uninsured creditors.  This is 
done in the interest of financial stability and safeguarding of payment and settlement systems, 
but carries the downside that under-capitalised banks often continue to access credit markets at 
artificially low costs of borrowing. Consequently, without appropriate supervisory constraints in 
place, such banks are in a position to delay the recognition of losses and engage in ever-greening 
or  zombie  lending,  which  is  essentially  the  rolling  over  of  debts  of  unviable  borrowers  that 
would have otherwise defaulted.  
In  fact,  this  was  precisely  what  happened  in  Japan  at  the  turn  of  the  last  century  when  the 
problem of non-performing loans and bank capital shortage persisted for over a decade. Hoshi 
and Kashyap (2010) attribute this to two factors: first, banks not recognising the true losses on 
NPAs, thereby overstating the quality of their loans; and, second, prevalence of zombie lending 
by  under-capitalised  banks.  It  was  only  after  the  implementation  of  the  of  Financial  Revival 
Program (Takenaka Plan) starting in 2003, involving more rigorous evaluation of bank assets, 
increasing  of  bank  capital,  and  strengthening  of  governance  for  recapitalised  banks,  that  the 
Japanese banks finally stopped the process of ever-greening non-performing loans and started to 
accumulate capital through retained earnings over the next five years. 
In addition to the above evidence on Japan which I covered in some detail in the 8th R K Talwar 
Memorial  Lecture,  my  recent  joint  work  with  Sascha  Steffen  and  Lea  Steinruecke,  titled 
“Kicking the Can Down the Road: Government Interventions in the European Banking Sector,” 
examined all government interventions in the Eurozone banking sector during the 2007 to 2009 
financial crisis. In particular, we analysed the implications of these interventions in the European 
banking sector for the subsequent sovereign debt crisis and found that: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Governments  with  weaker  public  finances  were  more  reluctant  to  recapitalise 
distressed banks during the financial crisis; and, 
 
The resulting insufficient recapitalisation of distressed banks had significant negative 
consequences  for  the  efficiency  of  real  sector  lending.  In  particular,  weak  banks 
remained  vulnerable  to  future  shocks  and  increased  their  risk-taking.  Furthermore, 
these  banks  did  not  write  down  defaulted  loans  but  instead  ever-greened  loans  to 
zombie  borrowers,  crowding  out  in  the  process  credit  extension  to  healthier 
borrowers.

The Case for Regulatory Prompt Corrective Action 
How  should  under-capitalised  banks,  and  more  generally,  banks  whose  asset  quality  and 
profitability  make  them  vulnerable  to  further  stress,  be  dealt  with,  taking  cognizance  of  the 
reality  that  the  strength  of  market  discipline  by  bank  creditors  is  blunted  by  the  presence  of 
explicit and implicit government guarantees?   
This  question  received  significant  academic  and  policy-maker  attention  in  the  United  States 
following the Savings & Loans (S&L) crisis, in which by mid-1980’s, so many thrifts had to be 
resolved at such low levels of capitalisation that in the end a significant government bailout in 
the form of blanket deposit insurance had to be engineered.  Effectively, it had been left until too 
late to exercise regulatory discipline that could have substituted for the lack of adequate market 
discipline;  as  a  result,  the  authorities  had  to  engage  in  excessive  forbearance  and  full-scale 
bailout.  
Key insight that emerged from the debate around the S&L crisis was that the banking regulator 
needed  to  adopt  a  “structured  early  intervention  and  resolution”  (SEIR)  approach  (see,  for 
instance, Benston and Kaufman, 1990, and White, 1991).  This insight, in turn, led to the passage 
of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Improvement Act (FDICIA), 1991, and thus 
was born the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework of the FDIC as modern banking has 
witnessed. [Another twin born then was risk-based deposit insurance premium!] 
Prompt Corrective Action frameworks adopt the core principles of structured early intervention 
and resolution in the following manner:  
(i) 
(ii) 
Thresholds  of  performance  (in  case  of  FDIC,  bank  capitalisation)  are  identified  to 
classify banks that breach the thresholds into categories, for instance, in the case of 
FDIC into “under-capitalised”, “significantly under-capitalised” and “critically under-
capitalised”.    The  first  thresholds  are  set  at  levels  that  are  well  above  what  would 
allow for an effective resolution or revival of banks. 
 
Banks  that  do  not  meet  the  thresholds  are  subjected  to  a  layered,  progressively 
stringent  “program”,  consisting  of  mandatory  and  discretionary  regulatory  actions, 
which  aim  to  prevent  further  hemorrhaging,  effectively  quarantining  the  banks  in 
breach  until  they  are  resolved.  Another  important  rationale  is  to  help  supervisors 
enforce corrective measures in a rule-based manner and this way reduce the risk of 
forbearance.  
Put simply, this is what Prompt Corrective Action (or PCA) is intended to achieve – to intervene 
early and take corrective measures in a timely manner, so as to restore the financial health of 
banks that are at risk by limiting deterioration in their health and preserving their capital levels.  
By construction then, PCA involves some restrictions on bank scope and expansion as not doing 
so would lead to excessive risks on the balance-sheets of these banks. Similarly, putting up PCA 
 6 
banks for sale in the market and / or replacing bank management become potential mechanisms 
for prompt resolution.  It follows as a corollary that the strength of the PCA framework depends 
crucially on the extent of regulatory powers that can be exercised by the banking regulator. 
While the intent of PCA is primarily remedial, it can also act as a deterrence and incentivise bank 
management and shareholders to contain risks so they do not end up in PCA in the first place.  
And, by the virtue of being reasonably rule-based, PCA reduces the scope for discretion; like 
Odysseus,  bank  regulators  tie  themselves  to  the  mast  to  evade  the  voices  of  the  forbearance 
sirens. 
Reserve Bank’s Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework 
The  Reserve  Bank’s  PCA  framework  was  introduced  in  December  2002  as  a  structured  early 
intervention  mechanism  along  the  lines  of  the  FDIC’s  PCA  framework.  Subsequently,  the 
framework was reviewed by the Reserve Bank keeping in view the international best practices 
and recommendations of the Working Group of the Financial Stability and Development Council 
(FSDC)  on  Resolution  Regimes  for  Financial  Institutions  in  India  (January  2014)  and  the 
Financial  Sector  Legislative  Reforms  Commission  (FSLRC,  March  2013).  The  Revised  PCA 
Framework was issued by the Reserve Bank on April 13, 2017 and implemented with respect to 
the bank financials as on March 31, 2017. 
Annex Ia provides the thresholds deployed under the revised framework, publicly available at 
https://www.rbi.org.in, linked to capital (CRAR – regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets ratio 
– and Leverage ratio), asset quality (NNPA –  net non-performing assets to advances ratio), and 
profitability (ROA – return on assets).  Under each measure, once the initial threshold is crossed, 
successive thresholds are employed to categorise banks into those violating Threshold 1 only, 
Threshold 1 and Threshold 2 only, or even Threshold 3.  
The revised PCA framework strengthened the earlier one along several dimensions, the salient 
changes being as follows: 
(i)  While  capital,  asset  quality  and  profitability  continue  to  be  the  key  areas  for 
monitoring  under  the  revised  framework,  common  equity  Tier-1  (Common  equity 
Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted Assets) ratio has also been included to constitute an 
additional trigger along with monitoring of leverage. This change acknowledges that 
it is common equity capital of a bank that has the highest loss-absorption capacity and 
is the least like debt. Overall, risk thresholds under the revised framework have been 
made more granular.  
 
Some of the corrective actions which were earlier a part of ‘structured (mandatory) 
actions’  to  be  taken  by  the  supervisor  have  been  moved  to  a  more  comprehensive 
menu of ‘discretionary actions’ under the revised framework (detailed comparison is 
(ii) 
 7 
in  Annex  Ib).  Thus,  the  scope  of  mandatory  actions  across  all  risk  thresholds  has 
been restricted essentially to: 
a.  Restriction on dividend distribution/remittance of profits; 
b.  Requirement on promoters/owners/parents to bring in more capital;  
c.  Restrictions on branch expansion;  
d.  Higher provisioning requirement; and,  
e.  Restrictions on management compensation.  
 
(iii)  While  no  restriction  has  been  imposed  on  the  retail  deposit-taking  activity  of  any 
bank till date, banks can be advised under the revised framework as a cost reduction 
measure to reduce or avoid altogether the high-cost bulk deposits and instead improve 
their Current Account and Saving Account (CASA) deposit levels. 
It  is  useful  to  compare  this  Revised  PCA  Framework  of  the  Reserve  Bank  to  the  PCA 
Framework of the FDIC as an international benchmark.  
 
Comparison with the FDIC’s PCA Framework  
Details of various thresholds as well as the mandatory and discretionary actions under the PCA 
Framework  of  the  FDIC  are  given  in  Annex  II.    In  terms  of  the  conceptual  design,  both 
frameworks mirror the core principles of structured early intervention and resolution. However, 
there are at least three significant differences:  
(i)  While FDIC triggers the PCA based only on bank capital thresholds, the Reserve Bank’s 
PCA  thresholds  also  include  asset  quality  and  profitability.  The  rationale  for  this 
difference  is  as  follows.  When  provision  coverage  ratio  (provisions  to  gross  non-
performing  assets  ratio)  of  banks  is  at  international  standards  as  in  the  US,  most 
anticipated  losses  are  already  built  into  bank  capital.  In  other  words,  non-performing 
assets net of provisions (NNPA ratio) is low. However, the provision coverage ratio of 
Indian banks has historically been much lower as we will see below (Chart 8), in part due 
to their maintaining only the minimum required provisions. As a result, the present level 
of bank capital masks the expected capital write-offs that will occur in future; this risk of 
future  under-capitalisation  is  captured  by  looking  for  below-threshold  asset  quality  (if 
NNPA ratio is high) and profitability (if return on assets or ROA is low so that capital 
accretion in future will be weak).  
 
(ii) The mandatory actions are much stricter and triggered earlier in terms of capitalisation 
levels in case of the FDIC. For instance, restrictions on asset growth and prior approval 
of  certain  expansion  proposals  kick  in  right  at  the  breach  of  Threshold-1  (“under-
capitalised” category of FDIC’s PCA bank classification).  
 
 8 
(iii) Beyond Threshold 2 (“significantly under-capitalised”), the mandatory actions by FDIC 
may  include  recapitalisation,  change  in  management  or  even  divestiture.  Indeed,  most 
banks  under  FDIC’s  PCA  are  resolved  through  auctions  where  typical  outcome  is  a 
purchase by another bank with an assumption of the PCA bank’s liabilities. Powers to 
undertake  such  actions  in  case  of  India’s  public  sector  banks  (PSBs)  lie  with  the 
Government  of  India.    As  enunciated  in  Governor  Patel’s  speech  in  March  2018, 
“Banking  Regulatory  Powers  Should  Be  Ownership  Neutral,”  the  Reserve  Bank  lacks 
legislative powers to enforce divestiture or change in management at PSBs. 
 
On  balance,  therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  RBI’s  PCA  Framework  is  less  onerous  as 
compared to the FDIC’s PCA Framework.  
Let  me  elaborate  on  the  point  (iii)  above.  Purchase  and  Assumption  (P&A)  is  the  most 
commonly used resolution method by the FDIC, as part of which a healthy institution purchases 
some  or  all  of  the  assets  of  a  failed  bank  and  assumes  some  or  all  of  the  liabilities.  When 
deciding which of these techniques to employ, the FDIC is guided legislatively by the “least cost 
to the taxpayers” requirement. The FDIC seeks bids from qualified bidders for the failed bank’s 
assets  and  the  assumption  of  certain  liabilities,  including  deposits,  and  accepts  the  bid  that  is 
judged least costly.  
If  no  viable  P&A  buyer  can  be  found,  then  the  FDIC  typically  deploys  a  deposit  payoff.  A 
deposit payoff involves repaying insured depositors, liquidating assets of the bank, and, dividing 
the proceeds from asset liquidation between itself and uninsured bank creditors. The FDIC might 
also use a Deposit Insurance National Bank (DINB) or bridge banks to resolve a failed bank, 
which entail establishing a new national bank with a short-period charter from the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The FDIC retains the majority of the assets in its corporate 
capacity as the receiver and eventually sells them.  
In India, merger of weak banks with stronger ones has been the primary mode of resolution of 
weak banks in the past. Section 45 of Banking Regulation Act 1949 empowers the Reserve Bank 
to make a scheme of amalgamation of a bank with another bank if it is in the depositors’ interest 
or in the interest of overall banking system. The operation of the weak bank may be kept under 
moratorium for a certain period of time to ensure smooth implementation of the scheme. Many 
private sector banks have been merged with other private sector banks or the PSBs under this 
mechanism. Since the onset of reforms in 1991, there were 22 mergers in the India banking space 
till 2010, 11 of which were compulsory mergers under Section 45 of the BR Act, 1949 (Bishnoi 
and Devi, 2015). However, one of the critical preconditions for this approach to succeed is that a 
substantial  part  of  the  banking  sector  be  well-capitalised.  If  the  potential  acquirers  are  poorly 
capitalised, it may result in inefficiencies in prices as well as timing in resolution of weak banks, 
besides increasing the risk of weakening the acquirers themselves through such acquisitions.

Performance of the PCA banks in India 
Let me now turn to some data.  The goal of the exercise will be to help understand the ten-year 
performance (wherever data is available) of banks on which the Reserve Bank has imposed the 
PCA.  The reason for examining the performance of these banks over a long time period is to 
appreciate the fact that the progress of banks under PCA cannot be judged over a relatively short 
time  scale.    The  longer  the  under-capitalisation  and  asset  quality  problems  have  festered,  the 
more patient one has to be during the rehabilitation process.  There is no quick fix or overnight 
silver bullet here; the reforms have to be implemented and allowed to run their course; they can’t 
be chopped or diluted mid-stream; the focus has to be on stability that is durable.   
As I explain below, there are emerging signs that the performance of banks under PCA is slowly 
but steadily being restored.   
Presently, there are twelve banks, eleven in the public sector and one in the private sector, under 
the Reserve Bank’s Revised PCA Framework, with PCA having been imposed on them between 
February 2014 and January 2018.  I will focus below only on the eleven PSBs under the PCA. 
The share of these PCA banks in advances and deposits as on March 31, 2018 was 18.5% and 
20.8%, respectively.  
The following trends emerge as one tracks the performance of these banks in terms of 
capitalisation and asset quality:  
(i) 
Capitalisation (Chart 1, 2): The declining trend of CRAR and Tier-1 capital ratio for 
PCA banks that started in 2011 has been arrested and the ratio has been maintained 
steady since 2014 at or above internationally prescribed levels. It may, however,  be 
noted that the PCA banks have had lower CRAR and Tier-1 capital ratios compared 
to non-PCA banks (barring 2011), and especially private banks (right since 2009).

Asset  quality  (Charts  3,  4,  5):  Both  the  gross  and  net  NPA  ratios  of  PCA  banks 
mirrored  those  of  non-PCA  banks  up  until  about  2014.    However,  post  the  Asset 
Quality  Review  (AQR)  exercise,  the  NPA  recognition  at  PCA  banks  has  led  to  a 
sharper rise in both gross and net NPAs, relative to non-PCA banks, and especially 
relative to private banks.  This does not mean that AQR caused the NPAs; it simply 
induced  the  long-overdue  recognition  of  NPAs.    Notably,  the  stressed  assets  ratio, 
which  besides  NPAs  includes  the  Restructured  Standard  assets  (that  enjoyed  the 
regulatory forbearance under the earlier guidelines), reveals that the underlying asset 
quality at PCA banks was deteriorating at a sharper pace compared to non-PCA banks 
right since 2011, which is now accepted as the time by which the lending boom of 
2009-10 began to unravel.

The Tide is Turning for the PCA Banks… 
As I have tried to explain, an important objective of the PCA is to first and foremost limit further 
losses and prevent erosion of bank capital, creating a platform of stability for the bank, and in 
turn, setting the stage for structural interventions to be implemented and pushed through.  
In assessing whether this objective is being attained, three observations are in order: 
(i) 
Recapitalisation  (Chart  6):  The  Government  of  India  has  infused  more  than  Rs. 
2,300 billion in public sector banks since 2005, more than half of which has gone into 
banks currently under PCA. Within PCA banks, almost half of the total infusion (i.e., 
Rs.  635  billion)  has  occurred  during  FY2018  and  FY2019,  after  the  banks  were 
classified  under  PCA.  This  recapitalisation  has  been  an  important  contributor  to 
financial stability of these banks and of the rest of the banking system they deal with.

Preventing  further  deterioration  (Chart  7):    In  spite  of  their  worse  capitalisation 
and stressed assets ratio compared to other banks, PCA banks had credit growth that 
was as strong as that of other banks up until 2014.  However, since the AQR exercise 
and the imposition of PCA, the year on year growth in advances for PCA banks has 
declined from over 10% in 2014 to below zero (contraction) by 2016 and remained in 
the  contraction  zone  since.    Given  the  evidence  presented  above  on  PCA  bank’s 
sustained  problem  of  asset  quality  (Charts  3,  4  and  5),  this  is  indeed  the  required 
medicine to prevent further hemorrhaging of their balance-sheets.

  (iii) 
Improvement in provision coverage ratio (Chart 8): Given the recapitalisation and 
prevention  of  further  hemorrhaging,  the  provision  coverage  ratio  (PCR)  of  PCA 
banks which had fallen off relative to that of other banks starting 2011 and reached 
below  40%  during  2012-2016,  has  now  recovered  to  that  of  non-PCA  PSBs.    The 
recovered level of PCR remains at present at around 50%, which is more 10% below 
that of private banks, and away from the desirable 70%. These numbers suggest that 
the  loss-absorption  capacity  of  PCA  banks  is  on  the  mend,  but  that  there  is  some 
distance to go in their catch-up to healthy levels.

Gross NPAs  
  There  is  an  assertion  being  made  in  some  circles  that  imposition  of  the  PCA  has  starved  the 
Indian  economy  of  credit.  There  is  little  factual  basis  for  this  assertion,  either  for  the  overall 
economy or at sectoral level. While it is true as shown above that PCA banks are experiencing 
lending contraction on average (in terms of their year on year growth in overall advances), the 
nominal  non-food  credit  growth  of  scheduled  commercial  banks  has  been  close  to  or  above 
double-digit levels, for past several quarters, and with a robust distribution across the sectors of 
the real economy (Chart 9).  This is because the reduction in lending at PCA banks is being more 
than  offset  by  credit  growth  at  healthier  banks.    This  is  indeed  what  one  wants  –  efficient 
reallocation of credit for the real economy with a financially stable distribution of risks across 
bank balance-sheets.  Indeed, the funding for the economy as a whole has become diversified 
over this period, also due to the growth of capital markets.

 There is also a call for more lending by PCA banks to large industries where the overall credit 
growth remains muted.  Note that many of these industries are heavily indebted to start with and 
are going through a deleveraging process under the IBC (so that at present, their sectoral capacity 
is still somewhat in excess and credit demand itself weak).  The key point is that PCA banks are 
de-risking the asset side of their balance sheets by moving away from riskier sector loans to less 
riskier  ones  and  government  securities;  the  first  and  foremost  priority  is  to  limit  (effectively, 
taxpayer) losses at PCA banks and prevent further erosion of their capital.  
 Conclusion 
Let me conclude. 
I have tried to explain why adequate bank capital is critical to fortify bank balance-sheets and a 
key indicator for the bank supervisors to closely monitor; and, how the Prompt Corrective Action 
(PCA) framework is employed internationally by bank supervisors and regulators as an accepted 
form  of  structured  early  intervention  and  resolution,  designed  to  help  banks  regain  health  by 
preserving capital.  
I then briefly explained the primary features of the Reserve Bank’s PCA framework, which is an 
essential element of its apparatus for safeguarding overall financial stability.  
 16 
The  evidence  I  presented  suggests  that  without  the  PCA  imposition,  some  banks  would  have 
incurred  even  higher  losses  and  required  even  more  of  taxpayer  money  for  recapitalisation.  
Imposition of PCA can thus be seen as first, stabilising the banks at risk, and then, undertaking 
the deeper bank reforms needed for long-term viability of the business model of these banks.   
It  is  important,  therefore,  that  the  PCA  framework  to  deal  with  financially  weak  banks  is 
persisted with.  Any slackening of the approach in the midst of required course action is an all 
too familiar and ultimately harmful habit that we must eschew.  
Well begun is only half done, as they say!
