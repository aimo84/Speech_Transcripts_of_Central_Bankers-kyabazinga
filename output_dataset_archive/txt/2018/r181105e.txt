Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy 
Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Nagoya 
Haruhiko Kuroda 
Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
Introduction 
It is my great pleasure to have the opportunity today to exchange views with a distinguished 
gathering of business leaders in the Chubu  region. I would like to take this opportunity to 
express  my  sincerest  gratitude  for  your  cooperation  with  various  activities  of  the  Bank  of 
Japan's Nagoya Branch. 
 At  the  Monetary  Policy  Meeting  (MPM)  held  last  week,  the  Bank  updated  its  projections 
for  Japan's  economic  activity  and  prices  through  fiscal  2020  and  released  them  in  the 
October 2018 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report). Today, I would 
like  to  explain  the  Bank's  outlook  for  Japan's  economic  activity  and  prices  as  well  as  its 
thinking behind the recent conduct of monetary policy, while outlining the Outlook Report. 
 I. Economic Developments 
Let  me  start  by  talking  about  economic  developments.  Japan's  economy  is  expanding 
moderately, with  a  virtuous  cycle  from  income  to  spending  being  maintained  in  both  the 
corporate and household sectors. The real GDP has been on an increasing trend, albeit with 
fluctuations,  and  the  output  gap  --  which  shows  the  utilization  of  capital  and  labor  -- 
widened within positive territory from late 2016, for seven consecutive quarters through the 
April-June quarter of 2018 (Chart 1). Under such circumstances, the duration of the current 
economic  recovery  phase,  which  began  in  December  2012,  is  likely  to  have  reached  69 
consecutive months this August. If this recovery continues, its duration in January next year 
will exceed the longest post-war recovery phase of 73 months. 
 Now, I would like to explain in detail the current situation of Japan's economy  by demand 
component.  First,  with  regard  to  external  demand,  let  me  take  a  look  at  the  underlying 
developments  in  overseas  economies.  According  to  the  latest  World  Economic  Outlook 
(WEO)  released  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  recently,  the  annual  real  GDP 
growth  rates  for  2018  and  2019  are  both  projected  to  be  3.7  percent  (Chart  2).  The 
projections for each year were revised downward by 0.2 percentage point from the previous 
ones  released  three  months  ago,  and  differences  in  growth  rates  among  regions  have 
widened  to  some  extent.  Thus,  the  synchronous  growth  of  the  global  economy  that  was 
observed  a  while  ago  has  been  changing  to  some  extent.  However,  the  main  scenario  is 
 1 
maintained,  in  which  the  global  economic  growth  rate  is  expected  to  remain  close  to  the 
peak after the global financial crisis, in the range of 3.5-4.0 percent, and a virtuous cycle of 
economic  activity  has  continued  to  operate  on  the  whole.  Looking  at  developments  by 
region, the U.S. economy has maintained its strong growth due in part to the effects of tax 
reductions, and the European economy has continued to recover, although its growth pace 
has decelerated somewhat. The Chinese economy has continued to see stable growth on the 
whole, although the pace of increase in  fixed asset investment has slowed recently. As for 
the outlook, the Chinese economy is likely to broadly follow a stable growth path as policy 
authorities conduct fiscal and monetary policy in a flexible manner, although it is expected 
to be affected to some extent by the United States having raised tariffs imposed on China. 
Other  emerging  economies  have  been  recovering  moderately  on  the  whole.  Under  such 
developments in overseas economies, Japan's exports have maintained their increasing trend, 
led  mainly  by  capital  goods  and  IT-related  goods,  in  which  Japan  has  a  comparative 
advantage.  On  this  point,  I  heard  from  firms  in  the  Chubu  region,  which  is  one  of  the 
biggest  production  sites  and  export  bases  of  machine  tools  in  Japan,  that  they  have 
continued to receive solid orders on the whole, mainly from the United States and Europe. 
 Next,  I  will  turn  to  domestic  demand.  First,  in  the  corporate  sector,  profits  have  followed 
their  improving  trend,  and  business  sentiment  has  stayed  at  a  favorable  level,  albeit  with 
fluctuations stemming from natural disasters. In this situation, business fixed investment has 
continued  on  an  increasing  trend  (Chart  3).  In  the  manufacturing  sector,  there  have  been 
notable increases not only in investment intended for domestic capacity expansion but also 
research  and  development  investment  in  anticipation  of  such  developments  as  changes  in 
market  structures.  I  heard  that  automobile-related  firms  in  this  region  have  been  actively 
proceeding with advancing next-generation technology such as that concerning self-driving 
systems  and  electric  vehicles.  In  the  nonmanufacturing  sector,  investment  aimed  at 
improving  efficiency  and  saving  labor  in  order  to  deal  with  the  recent  labor  shortage  has 
maintained its high growth nationwide. Such improvement in the corporate sector has had 
positive  effects  on 
the  household  sector.  In 
the 
labor  market, 
the  active 
job 
openings-to-applicants  ratio  has  been  at  a  high  level  that  exceeds  the  peak  of  the  bubble 
period,  and  the  unemployment  rate  has  declined  to  around  2.5  percent  (Chart  4).  The 
number of employees has registered a year-on-year rate of increase of around 2 percent, and 
 2 
total  cash  earnings  per  employee  have  risen  moderately  but  steadily.  Against  the 
background  of  such  improvement  in  the  employment  and  income  situation,  private 
consumption has been increasing moderately, albeit with fluctuations. 
 Let  me  now  talk  about  the  outlook  for  Japan's  economy.  The  Bank  projects  that  the 
economy  is  likely  to  continue its  moderate expansion.  In  the  Outlook  Report  released last 
week,  the  real  GDP  growth  rate  for  fiscal  2018  is  projected  to  be  1.4  percent,  and  this  is 
clearly above Japan's potential growth rate, which is estimated to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 
percent. As for fiscal 2019 and 2020, the real GDP growth rates are both projected to be 0.8 
percent  (Chart  5).  The  economy  is  expected  to  continue  on  an  expanding  trend,  partly 
supported  by  external  demand,  although  the  growth  pace  is  projected  to  decelerate,  due 
mainly to a cyclical slowdown in business fixed investment and the effects of the scheduled 
consumption tax hike. 
 There are, of course, upside and downside risks to this baseline scenario of the outlook for 
Japan's economic activity. In particular, uncertainties regarding overseas economies appear 
to have heightened recently. Of these uncertainties, the consequences of recent protectionist 
moves, including the trade friction between the United States and China, warrant attention, 
and  an  active  exchange  of  views  regarding  this  issue  took  place  at  the  Group  of  Twenty 
(G-20) meeting held in Indonesia last month. As was discussed at the meeting, the impact of 
protectionist policies on the global economy varies, largely depending not only on the direct 
effects  of  downward  pressure  on  trade  activity  but  also  the  extent  to  which  it  spreads  to 
firms'  fixed  investment  stance  and  global  financial  markets.  According  to  simulation 
analyses  related  to  this  issue  by  some  international  organizations,  the  degree  of  impact 
varies to some extent depending on the assumptions. Meanwhile, the Bank judges that the 
impact  on  Japan's  economy  has  been  limited  so  far,  mainly  based  on  the  recent  Tankan 
(Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) and interviews with firms. However, 
firms have voiced that it is difficult to accurately gauge the potential impact at this point. In 
addition to this, if protectionist moves last for a long time, we will need to pay attention to 
the possibility  that their effects on Japan's economy will become more significant through 
the  various  channels  that  I  mentioned  earlier.  Needless  to  reiterate,  protectionist  policies 
will  not  benefit  any  economy.  Therefore,  a  brake  is  expected  to  be  put  on  excessive 
 3 
protectionist  moves  at  some  point.  In  fact,  positive  progress  was  seen  recently  in  trade 
negotiations between the United States and Canada, Mexico, Europe, and Japan. While the 
focus will be on developments in negotiations between the United States and China for the 
time being, the Bank will thoroughly examine the consequences of protectionist moves and 
their effects on Japan's economy. 
 In addition, risk factors originating from overseas economies have been pointed out. These 
include  the  possibility  of  such  moves  as  policy  rate  hikes  in  the  United  States  leading  to 
capital  outflows  from  emerging  economies,  the  possibility  of  the  United  Kingdom  being 
driven into the so-called no-deal Brexit, and various geopolitical risks including those of the 
Middle  East.  Taking  account  of  these  various  risks,  stock  markets  of  various  economies 
have continued to see large fluctuations since mid-October, triggered by a significant fall in 
U.S. stock prices  (Chart 6). The favorable economic fundamentals of Japan as well as the 
United States and Europe have not changed substantially, and other financial markets such 
as the foreign exchange and government bond markets have been relatively calm. However, 
as uncertainties regarding overseas economies have heightened, it is necessary to carefully 
monitor future developments, including those in investors' sentiment and corporate profits. 
 II. Price Developments 
Now  I  will  move  on  to  price  developments.  The  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the 
consumer price index (CPI) has continued to show relatively weak developments compared 
to  the  economic  expansion  and  the  labor  market  tightening,  and  that  excluding  fresh  food 
and energy prices has been at around 0.5 percent (Chart 7). 
 This  is  likely  to  be  attributable  to  two  main  factors  (Chart  8).  First,  the  experience  of 
prolonged  low  growth  and  deflation  has  had  a  substantial  impact  on  people's  sentiment 
(Chart 9). For instance, according to a survey conducted by the government, the significant 
reasons  why  firms  do  not  pass  on  cost  increases  to  sales  prices  despite  rises  in  personnel 
expenses  and  prices  of  raw  materials  are  that  they  wish  to  maintain  relationships  with 
business  partners  and  consumers  and  are  concerned  about  reductions  in  sales  volumes. 
What  lies  behind  this  likely  is  that  people's  tolerance  of  price  rises  has  decreased,  due 
mainly  to  the  effects  of  prolonged  deflation.  In  order  to  ease  this  cautious  stance  toward 
 4 
price rises, households' income situation needs to improve. While there seems to be a need 
on  the  firms' side  to  keep  sufficient  funds  on  hand  considering  the  experience  of  past low 
growth  and  the  financial  crisis,  if  household  income  does  not  increase,  consumers' 
perception  of  price  rises will  not improve readily.  As  a  result,  firms' sales  and  profits  will 
not increase either. With tightening labor market conditions, wages of part-time employees 
have continued to register relatively high growth. However, in order to clearly change firms' 
and households' sentiment and resolve the situation where prices are stalling, a rise in wage 
growth rates as a whole will continue to be an important key. 
 The second reason for a rise in inflation taking time is changes in the business environment 
for  those  supplying  goods  and  services,  including  firms'  efforts  toward  improving 
productivity,  the  technological  progress  in  recent  years  that  promotes  such  efforts,  and  an 
increase  in  labor  participation  by  women  and  seniors.  Such  factors  have  allowed  firms  to 
avoid  raising  prices,  even  amid  cost  increases  resulting  from  the  economic  expansion.  To 
avoid  any  misunderstanding,  let  me  add  that  such  efforts  are  expected  to  lead  to 
strengthening the growth potential of the economy as a whole, and are favorable for Japan's 
economy.  On  the  price  front,  a  rise  in  future  growth  expectations  also  is  likely  to  make 
firms'  and  households'  spending  behavior  more  active,  thereby  contributing  to  pushing  up 
prices  in  the  long  term.  At  least  in  the  short  term,  however,  these  moves  will  weaken 
upward pressure on wages and prices. 
 So  far,  I  have  explained  the  reasons  why  prices  do  not  rise  easily.  In  fact,  prices  in Japan 
have continued to show relatively weak developments compared to the economic expansion. 
On  the  other  hand,  however,  the  economy  is  no  longer  in  deflation,  in  the  sense  of  a 
sustained decline in prices. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh 
food) has continued to accelerate, albeit with fluctuations. Although there is still a long way 
to  go  to  achieve  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent,  the  year-on-year  rate  of  change 
recently has risen to around 1 percent, which is about half the target (Chart 10). 
 A driver for such a rise in inflation is improvement in the output gap. As I mentioned at the 
beginning,  Japan's  output  gap  has  widened  within  positive  territory  for  seven  consecutive 
quarters. As written in economic textbooks, prices of goods and services rise when demand 
 5 
exceeds  supply.  In  addition,  as  economic  activity  becomes  more  dynamic,  it  is  likely  that 
labor  market  conditions  will  tighten  and  wage  growth  rates  will  rise  more  clearly.  Under 
these  circumstances,  it  is  expected  that  households'  tolerance  of  price  rises  will  improve, 
and along with this, firms' stance gradually will shift toward further raising prices. In fact, 
looking  at  developments  in  the  output  prices  DI  in  the  Tankan,  the  situation  recently  has 
taken hold in which the proportion of enterprises answering that the output prices have risen 
exceeds the proportion of those answering that such prices have fallen, for the first time in 
about 30 years since the bubble period. Thus, as firms' and households' cautious sentiment 
changes  and  further  price  rises  come  to  be  observed  widely,  on  the  back  of  the  positive 
output gap, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 
the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent,  in  line  with  a  rise  in  inflation  expectations. 
Specifically, in the latest Outlook Report, the year-on-year rates of change in the CPI (less 
fresh food) are projected to be 0.9 percent for fiscal 2018, and excluding the effects of the 
scheduled  consumption  tax  hike,  1.4  percent  and  1.5  percent  for  fiscal  2019  and  2020, 
respectively (Chart 11). As is the case with economic activity, there are various uncertainties 
regarding the pace of inflation going forward. Maintaining a positive output gap -- a driver 
for a rise in inflation  -- for as long as possible, which will firmly push up actual prices as 
well  as  inflation  expectations,  is  likely  to  be  the  most  certain  path  toward  achieving  2 
percent inflation. 
 III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy 
I  have  explained  economic  activity  and  prices  in  Japan  thus  far.  I  would  now  like  to  talk 
about the Bank's conduct of monetary policy. 
 The  Bank  has  been  conducting  powerful  monetary  easing  under  the  framework  of 
"Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control." In terms 
of  yield  curve  control,  with  a  view  to  facilitating  the  formation  of  the  yield  curve  that  is 
considered  most  appropriate  for  achieving  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent,  the  Bank 
has  conducted  large-scale  purchases  of  Japanese  government  bonds  (JGBs)  under  the 
guideline for market operations, in which it sets the short-term policy interest rate at minus 
0.1 percent and the target level of 10-year JGB yields at around zero percent (Chart 12). As 
I mentioned earlier, in order to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, it is important 
 6 
to maintain a positive output gap -- a driver for a rise in inflation -- for as long as possible. 
To  this  end,  it  is  necessary  to  persistently  continue  with  the  current  powerful  monetary 
easing. Based on this recognition, the Bank decided at the July 2018 MPM to enhance the 
sustainability of the policy as follows (Chart 13). 
 First, the Bank introduced forward guidance for policy rates. This is a measure that clarifies 
its policy stance of continuing with powerful monetary easing by making clear future policy 
rates  in  advance.  Specifically,  the  Bank  publicly  made  clear  to  "maintain  the  current 
extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of time, 
taking  into  account  uncertainties  regarding  economic  activity  and  prices  including  the 
effects of the consumption tax hike scheduled to take place in October 2019." 
 Second,  the  Bank  decided  to  conduct  market  operations  and  asset  purchases  in  a  more 
flexible manner as an adjustment to continue with powerful monetary easing going forward. 
For example, while the target level of the long-term  yields was maintained at around zero 
percent, the Bank made it clear that the actual yields might move upward and downward to 
some extent mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices. With the 
Bank's  large-scale  JGB  purchases  continuing,  their  side  effects,  such  as  rigid  JGB  yields 
and a decline in transactions, have been pointed out in the market. As interest rate formation 
becomes more flexible and the degree of market functioning improves reflecting the latest 
policy  response,  this  consequently  will  lead  to  enhancing  the  sustainability  of  the  current 
policy. 
 About  three  months  have  passed  since  the  policy  decision  was  made,  and  its  effects  have 
already  been  observed.  According  to  surveys  mainly  on  economists  conducted  in  the 
meantime,  there  has  been  a  significant  decline  in  the  number  of  respondents  holding  the 
view  that  the  Bank  will  raise  policy  rates  in  the  near  future.  This  shows  that  the  Bank's 
thinking has been clearly communicated to market participants through the introduction of 
forward  guidance  (Chart  14).  In  addition,  in  the  JGB  market,  both  spot  and  futures 
transactions  have  become  somewhat  more  active,  and  day-to-day  price  movements  have 
been increasing to some extent since the policy decision was made at the July MPM. In the 
first  half  of  this  year,  there  had  been  a  situation  where  JGB  yields  hardly  responded  to 
 7 
changes  in  stock  prices  and  U.S.  long-term  interest  rates,  but  the  price  linkage  of  these 
markets has been recovering. Thus, the degree of market functioning has improved with the 
Bank conducting JGB purchases in a flexible manner (Chart 15). 
 Regarding  the  effects  brought  about  by  powerful  monetary  easing,  its  relation  to  financial 
institutions'  profits  and  the  functioning  of  financial  intermediation  is  often  discussed.  The 
Bank  fully  recognizes  that,  by  continuing  such  monetary  easing,  financial  institutions' 
strength  will  be  cumulatively  affected  by  low  profitability,  mainly  through  a  decrease  in 
their lending margins, and that it could have an impact on financial system stability as well 
as the functioning of financial intermediation. That is, if financial institutions become more 
active  in  risk  taking  to  secure  profits  amid  the  low  interest  rate  environment  and  severe 
competition continuing, the financial system could destabilize should large negative shocks 
actually  occur  in  the  future.  Meanwhile,  prolonged  downward  pressure  on  financial 
institutions' profits under the continued low interest rate environment could create a risk of 
a gradual pullback in financial intermediation, partly through making them reluctant to lend. 
These points are analyzed in detail in the Bank's  Financial System Report released twice a 
year.  Although  these  risks  are  judged  as  not  significant  at  this  point,  mainly  because 
financial  institutions  have  sufficient  capital  bases,  the  Bank  will  make efforts  to  grasp  the 
latest  situation  through  its  on-site  examinations  and  off-site  monitoring  of  financial 
institutions  and  encourage  them  to  take  concrete  actions  as  necessary.  In  addition,  as 
mentioned  in  the  latest  Outlook  Report,  it  is  necessary  to  pay  close  attention  to  future 
developments  regarding  these  risks  and  side  effects,  from  the  viewpoint  of  conducting 
monetary policy as well. 
 Over  the  past  five  years,  Japan's  economy  has  clearly  improved.  Corporate  profits  have 
been at record highs, and the employment situation has improved substantially. Prices have 
improved  steadily  compared  to  five  years  ago,  when  the  economy  was  suffering  from 
deflation. Japan's economic activity and prices are no longer in a situation where decisively 
implementing a large-scale policy to overcome deflation was judged as the most appropriate 
policy  conduct,  as  was  the  case  before.  However,  it  has  been  taking  time  to  achieve  the 
price  stability  target  of  2  percent.  In  such  a  situation  where  economic  and  price 
developments have been somewhat varied, it has become necessary to persistently continue 
 8 
with powerful monetary easing while considering both the positive effects and side effects 
of monetary policy in a balanced manner. Going forward, the Bank will examine the risks 
considered  most  relevant  to  the  conduct  of  monetary  policy  and  conduct  its  policy  in  an 
appropriate manner, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well 
as financial conditions. 
 Conclusion 
Lastly,  I  would  like  to  conclude  my  speech  by  touching  upon  the  economy  of  the  Tokai 
region.  The  region  has  always  been  the  frontrunner  of  economic  recovery  in  the  current 
recovery  phase.  Production  in  the  regions'  manufacturing  sector  has  recovered  to  a  level 
exceeding  that  seen  immediately  before  the  global  financial  crisis,  and  moves  toward 
expanding  investment  also  have  been  spreading  in  the  nonmanufacturing  sector  with 
support from the financial side, as seen in infrastructure-related investment for railways and 
airports  as  well  as  in  newly  opened  large  retail  stores.  As  for  the  outlook,  large-scale 
projects, such as next-generation cars facing a "once-in-a-century transformational period" 
and  the  Linear  Chuo  Shinkansen  scheduled  to  start  operating  in  2027,  will  continue  to  be 
carried out in anticipation of what society will be like a decade or two from now. 
 Although you must all be familiar with this already, it is essential to pay attention to various 
risks and take precautions in order for the economy of the Tokai region to maintain steady 
growth.  On  this  point,  many  firms  in  this  region  have  made  progress  with  optimizing 
production sites at the global level since the global financial crisis. Such long-term efforts 
will likely function effectively as a countermeasure against protectionist moves, which are 
gradually  developing  into  a  somewhat  significant  risk.  In  addition,  a  number  of  natural 
disasters,  such  as  typhoons  and  earthquakes,  have  occurred  this  year.  Although  supply 
chains  in  the  Tokai  region  also  were  partly  damaged,  the  negative  impact  was  dealt  with 
relatively quickly. I heard that this has been the successful result of steady efforts made in 
the  past  few  years  toward  the  so-called  visualization  of  supply  chains,  based  on  the 
experience of the Great East Japan Earthquake. 
 While it may not be appropriate to treat it in the same way as the aforementioned risks, as a 
positive  output  gap  is  maintained  and  labor  market  conditions  continue  to  tighten,  labor 
 9 
shortage  eventually  may  be  a  significant  constraint  on  corporate  activities.  In  order  to 
overcome  this  situation  well,  so  that  firms  keep  growing,  how  to  secure  talented  human 
capital, including from the wage side, will be a more important challenge than ever before. 
Although  it  may  have  been  risky  under  deflation  to  take  actions  ahead  of  others,  the 
situation already has changed. I hope that corporate managers in this region will dispel the 
mindset  and  behavior  that  is  based  on  the  assumption  of  deflation  and  continue  to  take 
initiative  in  their  leading  roles  within  Japan's  economy.  I  would  like  to  close  my  speech 
today  by  making  a  commitment  that  the  Bank  will  persistently  continue  with  powerful 
monetary easing, thereby providing its utmost support for such initiative. 
 Thank you very much for your attention.

Reasons for a Rise in Inflation Taking Time
Mindset
Supply Side
 Experience of prolonged low growth and 
deflation
 Large room for firms to raise productivity
 Technological progress in recent years
 High wage elasticity of labor supply
The pace of improvement in prices and inflation expectations has remained slow
compared to the improvement in the output gap.
1. Firms' cautious wage- and price-setting stance
2. Sluggish increase in households' tolerance of price rises
3.
Intensifying competition

III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy
Strengthening the Framework for Continuous Powerful Monetary Easing
Chart 13
(Decided on 31 July, 2018)
Taking more time than expected to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent.
Maintaining the output gap as long as possible within positive territory is appropriate.
Persistently Continuing with Powerful Monetary Easing
Forward guidance for policy rates
"The Bank intends to maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an 
extended period of time, taking into account uncertainties regarding economic activity and prices including 
the effects of the consumption tax hike scheduled to take place in October 2019."
⇒ Strengthening the commitment to achieving the price stability target
Enhancing the sustainability of  "Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with 
Yield Curve Control"
Long-term interest rate: The Bank maintains the target level of around zero percent. While doing so, 
the yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on 
developments in economic activity and prices. 
Purchases of ETFs:        The Bank maintains the annual pace of increase in the amount outstanding of 
about 6 trillion yen. While doing so, the Bank may increase or decrease 
the amount of purchases depending on market conditions.                                  
etc.
