Jean-Pierre Roth: Recent Swiss experience in monetary policy strategy 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the 
Swiss  National  Bank  and  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Bank  for  International 
Settlements,  at  a  seminar  on monetary theory  and policy, University of Fribourg,  Fribourg, 
28 November 2007. 
The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 One  continually  recurring  element  in  the  history  of  the  Swiss  National  Bank  has  been  the 
application  of  a  clear  set  of  rules  that  we  refer  to  nowadays  as  ′strategy′.  The  SNB′s 
monetary policy strategy consists of three elements: a definition of price stability, an inflation 
forecast and a fluctuation range assigned to a short-term interest rate. 
Experiences  with  this  strategy  since  its  introduction  in  the  year  2000  –  judged  in  terms  of 
both price stability and cyclical developments in the economy – have demonstrated its value. 
Nevertheless,  certain  aspects  of  the  strategy  have  been  questioned  by  academics  and  by 
central bankers. These include inflation forecasting under the assumption of a fixed Libor, the 
choice of the reference interest rate, the role of monetary aggregates and exchange rates in 
the SNB′s models, and the decision not to publish the minutes of Governing Board meetings. 
However, these deliberately selected elements in fact serve to reinforce the legitimacy of the 
SNB′s strategy.
