Barbro Wickman-Parak: The Riksbank and the property market  
Speech  by  Ms  Barbro  Wickman-Parak,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at 
Fastighetsdagen 2008, Stockholm, 14 May 2008. 
 Subprime  loans  in  the  United  States  were  the  origins  of  the  deep-seated  tensions  in  the 
international financial markets, which have not yet relinquished their grip after almost a year. 
The problems in the subprime market are an important reason behind the collapse in housing 
construction  and  the  falling  house  prices,  which  have  made  a  profound  impression  on  the 
real  economy  in  the  United  States.  In  some  other  countries,  too,  the  earlier  sharp  rises  in 
property prices have slowed down and been replaced by falling prices. Here in Sweden we 
have so far been spared these events. How does the Riksbank view future developments in 
the  property  market  and  what  stance  does  the  Bank's  monetary  policy  take  in  relation  to 
asset prices? Today I will address these questions. I will also briefly comment on the recent 
developments in the financial markets. 
Several  countries  have  experienced  rapidly  rising  house  prices,  for  instance  the  United 
States and the United Kingdom, as well as Denmark, Ireland and Spain. Recently there has 
been a slowdown in the rate of increase and in some of these countries house prices are 
now falling. In the United States house prices have fallen by around 10 per cent since the 
peak in 2006 (see figure 1). 
In  Sweden,  too,  house  prices  have  risen  rapidly,  even  more  so  than  in  the  United  States. 
Since 1995 Swedish house prices have risen by more than 150 per cent; the corresponding 
figure in the United States is around 115 per cent. At the same as house prices have soared, 
inflation in Sweden has been moderate and consumer prices have only risen by 14 per cent 
since 1995 (see figure 2). 
There are several factors behind the upturn in Swedish house prices; Swedish households’ 
real incomes have grown, their financial wealth has increased and in addition real interest 
rates have been low. Although more housing has been built, it has not been enough to meet 
the  demand.  The  percentage  of  Swedish  municipalities  reporting  a  shortage  of  housing 
doubled  to  42  per  cent  between  2002  and  2007  according  to  statistics  from  the  National 
Board of Housing, Building and Planning. More than half, or 60 per cent, of the population 
now live in municipalities with housing shortages.  
Households’  debt  ratio,  that  is  their  debts  in  relation  to  their  disposable  income,  has  risen 
rapidly in recent years and is now around 150 per cent. It is difficult to compare the current 
debt ratio with earlier periods, as these have been marked by the conditions prevailing at the 
time. For example, the debt ratio that preceded the credit boom at the end of the 1980s was 
marked by the regulated credit market and did not reflect either households' willingness or 
ability to bear debt. The period after this was affected by the economic crisis and institutional 
changes with an ensuing rapid credit crunch. Unlike the 1980s, the build up of debt in recent 
years has been in an environment of low inflation and low interest rates. The interest ratio, 
that is, interest expenditure as a share of disposable incomes, is much lower now than it was 
then.  
Although the level of households' debt ratios is not necessarily worrying, it is nevertheless 
the case that a borrowing level rising by more than 10 per cent a year is not sustainable in 
the  long  term.  In  the  long  term  it  needs  to  come  down  and  be  more  in  line  with  nominal 
disposable  incomes.  The  Riksbank  is  assuming  that  household  borrowing  will  continue  to 
increase,  but  at  a  slower  rate  than  before.  The  fact  that  interest  rates  have  been  raised 
contributes to this, as does the fact that economic activity is entering a calmer phase. The 
interest ratio has recently begun to rise but is still at an historically low level. The expected

slowdown in household borrowing will mean that the interest ratio also increases at a slower 
rate in future (see figure 3). 
The chances are good that household borrowing and house prices will have a soft landing. 
Although  borrowing  is  still  increasing  at  a  rapid  rate,  there  has  nevertheless  been  some 
slackening and this is expected to continue. House prices fell slightly in the first quarter of 
this  year  compared  with  the  final  quarter  of  last  year.  However,  on  an  annual  basis  the 
increase was just over seven per cent. Prices of owner-occupied apartments also fell during 
the autumn, but have since stabilised.  
Employment  and  household  incomes  are  of  the  utmost  importance  when  it  comes  to 
movements  in  the  property  market.  According  to  the  Riksbank’s  most  recent  forecast, 
employment is expected to continue rising this year, albeit at a slower pace than last year. 
Following a strong rise last year, around 4 per cent, households’ real disposable incomes are 
expected to increase by a good 2 per cent over the coming years. Given this outcome, there 
is little risk of a fall in house prices to the same extent as is happening in the United States, 
for example. In Sweden savings are also high to start with, unlike the United States where 
they have fallen to historically low levels. 
There is always a risk that house prices, and also other asset prices such as shares, which 
have  been  pushed  up  by  exaggerated  optimism  or  speculation,  could  plummet.  It  would 
appear  that  Swedish  price  movements  can  be  explained  by  fundamentals,  and  that  the 
speculative element has happily been conspicuous by its absence.  
As  property  often  functions  as  collateral  for  loans,  a  large  fall  in  prices  would  affect  the 
banks.  In  addition,  developments  in  the  property  market  affect  demand  in  the  economy. 
Rising  house  prices  mean  that  households  can  take  on  new  loans  to  increase  their 
consumption.  Correspondingly,  falling  house  prices  can  contribute  to  subduing  demand  in 
the economy. An IMF study of twenty property crises in different countries shows that they 
entailed  a  fall  in  prices  of  30  per  cent.  The  countries’  GDP  was  on  average  four  per  cent 
lower three years after a property crisis had started than it would have been without the fall in 
prices.1  The  scars  in  the  real  economy  may  well  be  considerable  and  given  this  it  is 
interesting to discuss how a central bank should react to changes in asset prices.  
In  the  international  debate  on  asset  prices  and  monetary  policy  there are  several  different 
points of view. A common view is that monetary policy should only react to changes in asset 
prices to the extent that these affect the central bank’s inflation and growth forecasts. One 
should thus not have a separate strategy for dealing with changes in property prices.  
Others  think  that  a  central  bank  can  improve  the  outcome  for  inflation  and  production  by 
reacting  to  changes  in  asset  prices  over  and  above  their  consequences  for  the  inflation 
forecast. Two main arguments have been put forward. Firstly, monetary policy can alleviate 
the effect of the price change on the real economy. Secondly, the actual knowledge that the 
central  bank  will  react  should  reduce  the  probability  of  exaggerated  price  movements 
occurring.  The  difficulty  lies  in  determining  whether  or  not  prices  are  increasing  at  an 
exaggerated rate. It is not necessarily so that a central bank is better qualified to make such 
an  assessment  than  the  market  participants.  In  addition,  there  is  uncertainty  over  how 
monetary policy affects asset prices.  
The Riksbank conducts what is known as flexible inflation targeting. The objective is that the 
annual  change  in  the  consumer  price  index  (CPI)  shall  be  2  per  cent,  but  we  also  attach 
some  importance  to  attaining  a  balance  in  production  and  employment.  Asset  price 
movements are normally included within the scope of flexible inflation targeting. We include 
changes  in  asset  prices  and  other  financial  variables  in  the  balance  when  we  make  our 
forecasts. However, the Riksbank has no target for property prices.

The Riksbank’s view is close to the reasoning that changes in asset prices should only be 
allowed to affect monetary policy to the extent that they affect our forecasts. But such a view 
is based on the forecasting models used being able to include the full effect of house prices 
on total demand in the economy. This is not the case for the Riksbank or other central banks; 
there  are  no  forecasting  tools  that  can  entirely  capture  the  effects  of  changes  in  property 
prices. The forecasts therefore have to be supplemented with qualitative assessments. 
How  has  the  Riksbank’s  stance  affected  monetary  policy  in  practice?  When  the  Riksbank 
raised the repo rate in January 2006 borrowing and house prices had a more pronounced 
effect on the decision. The Riksbank assumed that it would soon be necessary to raise the 
interest  rate,  but  if  only  inflation  had  been  taken  into  consideration,  it  would  have  been 
possible to wait a little longer before making this decision. Now the interest rate raise was 
brought forward to counteract the risk that an adjustment in the property market would cause 
a  large  fall  in  demand  and  lead  to  inflation  undershooting  the  target  when  regarded  in  a 
perspective  beyond  the  normal  forecast  horizon.  The  influence  on  interest  rate  policy  was 
thus marginal, but on the other hand the expansion in household borrowing and house price 
movements were mentioned frequently in a number of speeches and interviews. 
I was not at the Riksbank then, but I can imagine that it was no easy decision. The Riksbank 
was criticised for not bringing up inflation to the target of 2 per cent, that is, the repo rate 
should not have been raised. But could one just sit by and watch the risks that threatened in 
the  longer  term?  This  was  a  conflict  of  interests  that  soon  petered  out.  The  interest  rate 
raises  made  since  then  have  gone  hand  in  hand  with  strong  economic  activity  as  well  as 
rising inflationary pressures, which have demanded a higher interest rate. 
Let me now also mention the commercial property market. Commercial property prices rose 
sharply during the second half of the 1990s and peaked in 2000. During the following four 
years prices fell. In 2005 they began to rise again and in Stockholm they have risen by 60 
per cent up to the present time.  
At  the  end  of  the  1990s  the  price  increases  appear  to  have  been  largely  driven  by  an 
increase  in  demand  for  office  premises,  by  vacancies  being  cut  down  and  by  rents 
increasing. The situation during the upswing in recent years, from 2005, has been different. 
Rents have not followed the price upswing to the same extent as before, and prices appear 
to  have  been  largely  driven  by  a  decline  in  investors’  demands  for  return.  Investors  have 
been  requiring  less  compensation  for  the  risk  they  take  when  investing  in  property.  This 
means that investors appear to have had high expectations of future income, that is, rents 
(see figure 4). 
As in the housing market, the price increase on office premises slowed down somewhat in 
2007 and this trend has continued during the first quarter of 2008. The same tendency can 
be found in several European countries. The financial turmoil has pushed up the price of risk 
in  general,  and  this  has  also  applied  to  the  property  market.  In  the  United  Kingdom  the 
required rate of return increased quickly and property prices have fallen.  
There are some indications that Swedish investors in property have begun to raise the price 
of risk. So far this appears to mainly apply to property in poorer locations and smaller towns. 
In  Stockholm  city  centre  investors  in  the  property  market  are  not  requiring  any  higher 
earnings  than  a  risk-free  five-year  government  bond  provides.  It  may be  the  case  that  the 
required rate of return has begun to rise more in general, but that this has not been captured 
in the statistics (see figure 5). 
It  is  difficult  to  determine  what  direction  prices  for  office  premises  will  take.  Rising  risk 
premiums indicate that prices should be pushed down. At the same time, however, the rental 
market is currently relatively strong. As the service sector is office-intensive, activity in this 
sector  affects  the  possibilities  for  leasing.  But  there  is  considerable  sensitivity  to  weaker 
economic activity.

In the autumn Financial Stability Report the Riksbank saw a risk that expectations of future 
increases in income in the property market were too high. We thus saw the risk of a fall in 
prices. Since then the required rate of return has risen with regard to commercial property 
around the world, while economic activity is more uncertain. This should reasonably have an 
effect on prices in the Swedish property market (see figure 6). 
The property market remains a hot topic and those who are interested can read more about 
the  property  market  and  commercial  property  in  the  Riksbank's  next  Financial  Stability 
Report, which will be published on 3 June. 
Let  me  conclude  with  a  few  words  on  the  financial  markets.  As  I  mentioned  earlier,  the 
problems  in  the  US  subprime  market  had  widespread  and  profound  effects  on  the 
international  financial  markets.  These  loans  had  been  packaged  together  with  other 
securities  into  structured  products  and  sold  to  investors  around  the  world.  The  uncertainty 
over  where  the  potential  losses  were  created  a  general  distrust  between  the  banks  and  a 
general increase in risk aversion.  
The former was expressed in a rise in the differences between interbank rates and risk-free 
government  bonds,  what  are  known  as  TED  spreads.  The  latter  was  expressed  in,  for 
instance, rising credit spreads (see figures 7 and 8). 
For a few weeks now we have seen signs that the tensions in the credit market have eased. 
The  credit  spreads  have  declined  and  the  cost  of  insuring  against  losses  has  fallen  (see 
figure 9). 
Other signs are that the banks have been able to sell off loans from their balance sheets. 
They  have  also  been  able  to  strengthen  their  own  capital,  although  a  large  part  of  this 
process still remains. The stock markets have also recovered. 
The  uncertainty  in  the  interbank  market  has  prevailed  longer;  the  TED  spreads  have 
remained high but have fallen over the past few days. In Sweden the TED spreads have also 
risen,  but  unlike  other  countries  the  markets  have  continued  to  function  without  any 
intervention from the Riksbank. 
Despite the fact that there are positive signs, it is still too early to assume the danger is past. 
There  may  still  be loan  losses  that  may  damage  trust  and  confidence  in  the  market  when 
they come to light. This applies to both the United States and Europe.
