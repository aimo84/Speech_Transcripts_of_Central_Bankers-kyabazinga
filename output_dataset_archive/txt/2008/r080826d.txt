Summary 
Global economic conditions 
Global  growth  is  slowing.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  expects  global  growth  to 
slow to 4.1% in 2008 and to soften further to 3.8% in 2009. Our major trading partners and 
visitor source markets have a sluggish outlook for the next two years.  However, emerging 
market  economies,  like  China  and  India,  will  continue  to  experience  firm  growth  rates  and 
provide stability to global growth. 
Domestic conditions 
• 
GDP growth: After contracting in 2007 (-6.6 percent), our economy is undergoing 
some recovery in 2008 (1.7 percent). Forecasts for 2009 and 2010 are 1.1 percent 
and 1.6 percent, respectively. These forecasts were released by the Macroeconomic 
Policy Committee in April 2008. These growth rates are too low and insufficient to 
generate sufficient employment opportunities. 
2008/2009 growth sectors: Tourism is one of the key growth sectors for 2008 and 
2009. Tourism also contributes to the growth of the other sectors. 
Inflation: Inflationary pressures will continue through to the end of the year. Inflation 
is expected to exceed 8 percent by September before settling at around 7.5 percent 
by year end. 
Foreign  reserves:  Monetary  policy  of  the  Reserve  Bank  in  recent  years  was 
focussed on protecting foreign reserves. Foreign reserves levels are holding up well 
   BIS Review 100/2008

  at around $940 million. Current levels are sufficient to cover around 4.0 months of 
imports of goods. This is a very comfortable level. 
Lending  rate  of  banks:  Interest  rates  have  trended  down  since  early  2007  to 
around 8 percent now. 
Commercial banks’ private sector lending: Despite the credit ceiling imposed by 
the Reserve Bank, lending to the private sector has exceeded the credit ceiling due 
to  special  approvals  given  by  the  Reserve  Bank  for  special  investment  projects. 
Special  approvals  have  totalled  $250  million  dollars.  Approvals  for  the  Building  & 
Construction  have  reached  $125  million  followed  by  Transport,  Storage  & 
Communication  ($21  million),  Electricity,  Gas  &  Water  ($16  million)  and 
Manufacturing ($16 million). Other miscellaneous approvals totalled $72 million. 
Recent figures show a moderate recovery in bank lending. 
Fiji’s tourism industry 
• 
     Visitor arrivals: Visitor arrivals are at historical highs. A strong recovery in visitor 
arrivals  by  an  annual  12  percent  was  seen  in  the  first  seven  months  of  the  year. 
Using the Fiji Islands Visitors Bureau’s growth forecast of around 571,000 visitors for 
2008 translates to a projected annual growth rate of around 6 percent. 
Visitor arrivals by country: Our nearest neighbours, Australia and New Zealand, 
account for more than half (56%) of our visitor source market. The growing markets 
of US (12%), Canada (3%) and Europe (15%), provide us with 30% of our visitors. 
Tourism earnings: While we note historically high levels in visitor arrivals, tourism 
earnings is what ultimately matters – for the industry and for the country in terms of 
foreign exchange, employment and investment. Tourism earnings have largely been 
flat  since  2004.  In  2008,  we  expect  a  marginal  improvement  over  2006  earnings 
levels, a 6.7 percent rise in 2009 and a 14.6 increase in 2010. Thereafter we are 
hopeful that the tourism earnings will reach and surpass the $1 billion mark. 
Gross foreign exchange earners in 2008: Tourism is the major source of foreign 
exchange for Fiji forming around 23 percent of total foreign exchange receipts1 in 
gross terms. 
Occupancy: There has been a huge level of investment into the hotel industry in the 
last  few  years  where  we  have  seen  new  hotels,  renovations/extension  of  existing 
ones  and  an  expansion  of  services  provided  (weddings/spas/conventions).  The 
increase in hotels and rooms have seen occupancy levels fall. 50 percent of tourism 
capacity in terms of room days is unutilised. The challenge for the industry and for 
the country is to fill these rooms. 
Employment:  The  Hotels  &  Restaurants  sector  directly  employed  around  9,000 
workers  in  2007.  Using  the  hotels  employment  multiplier  of  2.6,  the  total 
employment  generated  by  the  tourism  industry  is  approximately  23,400  workers. 
The employment multiplier was sourced from a 1990 study by the Tourism Council 
of the South Pacific (TCSP).2

Fiji’s tourism industry – retention rate and economic impact 
• 
An industry which is not fully integrated into the domestic economy 
Import of food and other requirements 
Repatriation of income and interest payments on foreign loans 
Overseas marketing costs 
Other foreign services 
Retention rate:  The  1990  study  by  the  TCSP  showed  the  tourism  industry  in  Fiji 
has a retention rate of 44 percent. Hence for every $1000 of tourist dollars spent in 
the  country,  $438  is  retained  in  the  economy  after  deducting  import  requirements 
(direct, indirect and induced). 
Factors contributing to higher leakage: These include: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
Tourism’s  impact  on  the  economy:  Based  on  the  methodology  and  tourism 
multiplier  (2.9)  provided  in  an  in-house  study,  which  compares  well  with  the  1990 
study by the TCSP, and using projections for 2008, the tourism industry is expected 
to contribute $1,424 million this year, equivalent to 24 percent of GDP. 
Policy implications 
o 
Given  that  there  is  50  percent  spare  capacity,  strategies  must  be  put  in 
place immediately to increase visitor arrivals!! 
Improve local input into tourism industry. Possible ways are: 
- 
o 
Improve  the  quality  and  consistency  of  local  fruits  &  vegetables, 
thereby reducing imports 
Examine ways to increase production of beef and other meat and 
dairy products 
Encourage manufacturers to produce goods demanded by tourists 
Provide  more  opportunities  for  tourists  to  spend  locally  (eg, 
expanding retail opportunities) 
  Summary 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Tourism is a key driver for economic growth in Fiji 
Provides vital support to Balance of Payments 
Highly resilient, has quick bounce-back 
Industry  with  substantial  spare  capacity  to  immediately  propel  growth  to  higher 
levels 
Need to remain competitive 
Some downside risks: 
o 
o 
The global slowdown 
Rising oil and food prices
