Axel A Weber: Discussion of “EMU and Financial Integration” by Philip 
Lane and on “Financial Integration and Risk Sharing: The Role of the 
Monetary Union” by Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan et al.  
Comments by Professor Axel A Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Fifth 
ECB Central Banking Conference “The Euro at Ten: Lessons and Challenges”, Frankfurt am 
Main, 13 November 2008. 
 Introduction  
1  
The euro at ten can justifiably be called a success story, and increasing financial integration 
in the euro area is a striking example of this. I am therefore pleased to comment on the two 
very  interesting  and  insightful  papers  presented  by  Philip  Lane  and  by  Sebnem  Kalemli-
Ozcan, Simone Manganelli, Elias Papaioannou and José Luis Peydró.  
Professor Pagano has already given some helpful and meaningful comments on the papers. 
In  my  comments,  I  shall  first  concentrate  on  Philip’s  reflections  on  EMU  and  financial 
integration and add to them some findings for Germany. Second, I shall discuss some issues 
raised by Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan et al. in their paper on the role of the monetary union for 
financial integration and risk sharing.

Philip Lane’s paper builds on his extensive research on EMU and financial integration, and 
presents  us  with  a  comprehensive  and  well  structured  overview  of  recent  research  and 
market developments. The paper provides broadly based evidence that the first ten years of 
EMU  have  seen  a  remarkable  increase  in  financial  integration,  even  if  the  extent  of 
convergence varies across different sectors. Philip notes that there are still many barriers to 
full integration, but that initiatives, such as SEPA, Target 2 and T2S should remove some of 
these obstacles. This is why the Eurosystem is actively supporting these projects. Philip then 
challenges  a  number  of  general  predictions  about  the  macroeconomic  impact  of  financial

Home bias 
Home bias: Some findings for Germany
(cid:122) The home bias of German investors has declined
(cid:122) EMU plays a prominent role in how the portfolios of German 
investors are diversified internationally. This is due to
– decline in transaction costs
– harmonisation of financial market institutions (FSAP)
– improved information on foreign investments
3 
To complement Philip’s findings on financial integration in bond and equity markets, I would 
like  to  focus  on  one  issue  of  great  importance:  To  what  extent  has  investors’  home  bias 
changed over the past decade? Using German data it can be shown nicely, first, that home 
bias  has  declined  and  second,  that  EMU  plays  a  prominent  role  in  how  the  portfolios  of 
German investors are diversified internationally. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To start with some theory, Solnik’s1 (1974) international Capital Asset Pricing Model predicts 
–  given  there  are  no  transaction  costs  –  that  the  regional  diversification  of  a  securities 
portfolio should be the same in all countries worldwide and it should copy the structure of the 
global portfolio. 
In reality, the portfolios in all countries show divergences from this “benchmark portfolio” in 
favour  of  domestic  securities;  this  “home  bias”  can  be  explained  by  transaction  costs  and 
imperfect information, in particular, concerning foreign securities. 
In  the  euro  area,  transaction  costs  should  have  declined  significantly  with  the  abolition  of 
exchange  rate  movements  within  the  European  Monetary  Union  and  further  initiatives  for 
harmonising the financial market institutions by the Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP). At 
the same time, information on foreign investments can be expected to have improved within 
EMU.  To  see  whether  these  predictions  are  true,  I  shall  now  investigate  the  regional 
structure of the German international investment position. German investors’ preference for

domestic  securities  is  calculated  by  comparing  the  share  of  actual  foreign  assets  held  by 
German investors with the percentage of foreign assets in the global benchmark portfolio.2
Against this backdrop, home bias on the assets side indicates whether foreign securities are 
less  intensively  (and  domestic  securities  are  more  strongly)  represented  in  the  national 
portfolio compared with the benchmark. A home bias would reach the value 100 if investors 
were to take exclusively domestic securities into their portfolios. If the benchmark portfolio is 
perfectly copied, the home bias would carry the value 0. A negative number of the home bias 
indicates that domestic investors invest more heavily in the securities of a particular country 
or group of countries than is indicated by the global benchmark portfolio.

The calculations yield some interesting results: First, since the start of EMU, the home bias 
of  German  investors  in  equities  has  been  tending  to  decline.  While,  in  1998,  German 
investors invested 76% of their stock in domestic equities, this share had diminished to 58 % 
at  the  end  of  2007.  By  comparison,  the  percentage  of  German  equities  in  the  global 
benchmark portfolio was 6 % in both years. In our calculations, this yields a decline in the 
home bias from 75% to 55% of the benchmark. 
Second,  German  investors  have  developed  a  strong  liking  for  stocks  of  EMU  partner 
countries  –  as  the  corresponding  negative  home  bias  demonstrates.  In  the  beginning,  the 
German  “EMU  bias”  was  only  small  but  it  has  grown  to  a  notable  amount  during  the  past 
decade. At the end of 2007, the share of EMU equity securities in German investors’ portfolio 
was 51 % higher than the corresponding portion in the global benchmark portfolio. 
Third,  with  regard  to  extra-EMU  investment,  German  home  bias  was  also  reduced,  albeit 
slightly.

These results are not specific to German portfolios. Investors from other EMU countries also 
display  a  bias  in  favour  of  German  bonds.  This  is  reflected  in  the  disproportionately  large 
representation of German bonds in the portfolios of the other EMU member states.  
To put it in a nutshell, the data on home bias and “EMU bias” with regard to German cross-
border  investment  in  securities  give  an  idea  of  how  EMU  has  influenced  cross-border 
financial integration. The home bias is also an important issue when it comes to investigating 
international risk sharing. This brings me to the paper by  Sebnem  Kalemli-Ozcan, Simone 
Manganelli, Elias Papaioannou and José Luis Peydró.  
Note: Bond portfolios include medium to long-term debt securities. The number indicates the 
underrepresentation of foreign securities in German portfolios as a percentage of their share in the benchmark 
portfolio. A negative number indicates an overrepresentation.

Part I of their interesting and topical paper gives an overview of financial integration in EMU 
and  describes  the  main  legislative  and  regulatory  policies  that  EU  member  states  have 
implemented in financial markets. Part II provides empirical evidence for the impact of the 
single currency and European harmonisation policies on financial integration. Furthermore, it 
analyses the implications for consumption risk sharing in the euro area. The main findings 
are that the single currency and the harmonisation policies of EU have both fostered financial 
integration and that cross-border banking integration increases consumption risk sharing. 
EMU and cross-border banking integration 
4.2 
An  important  contribution  made  by  Sebnem  Kalemli-Ozcan  et  al.  is  that  they  try  to 
disentangle  the  impact  of  the  single  currency  and  harmonisation  policies  on  financial 
integration.  This  distinction  is  of  major  relevance  with  respect  to  the  further  process  of 
integration.  
The  authors’  focus  on  banking  integration  is  appropriate  with  regard  to  the  subsequent 
analysis  of  consumption  risk  sharing,  where  bank  lending  is  deemed  to  be  a  prominent 
transmission  channel.  However,  it  should  be  kept  in  mind  that  there  are  more  financial 
market segments of interest and that the euro and harmonisation policies might affect them 
to a different degree. As I have already noted, there is strong evidence that monetary union 
has fostered integration of markets for equity and long-term debt securities. 
Banking integration and risk sharing 
4.3 
As  for  the  authors’  concept  of  consumption  risk  sharing,  let  me  make  two  remarks.  First, 
consumption smoothing is measured relative to a panel of 20 European and non-European 
countries.  This  reflects the  fact  that  the  paper  concentrates  on  differences  in  consumption 
growth  across  countries  and,  therefore,  analyses  international  consumption  smoothing. 
Domestic smoothing is thereby ignored. Furthermore, the estimates do not make a distinction 
between whether consumption smoothing of EMU countries takes place within the euro area 
or  vis-à-vis  the  rest  of  the  world.  It  is  true  that,  from  a  welfare  point  of  view,  a  distinction 
between intra and extra-euro-area risk sharing does not make sense. However, the authors’ 
conclude that “the increased cross-banking integration due to the euro has improved ex-post 
the optimality of the currency union by improving risk sharing”. This implies that risk sharing 
of euro area countries takes place mainly among each other. 
My second comment concerns the way the authors measure consumption smoothing. The 
paper regresses international differences in consumption growth on international differences 
in  GDP  growth,  multiplied  by  a  term  including  banking  integration.  A  perfect  consumption 
smoothing  would  imply  that  asymmetric  GDP  shocks  do  not  transmit  into  diverging 
consumption paths at all. 
Following  Asdrubali,  Sørensen  and  Yosha  (1996)  and  the  modification  of  Mélitz  (2004),  it 
might be helpful not to stop here but to have a further look at the individual components of 
GDP and the respective channels of risk sharing.3

In this disaggregation, we would expect the term 
through which consumption smoothing by cross-border banking integration should work. 
In  the  following  table,  calculated  for  Germany,  the  coefficients  βE  and  βH  indicate  the 
absorption  of  additional  GDP  growth  by  net 
foreign  income  and  external  saving, 
respectively.5  A  positive  sign  stands  for  a  positive  effect  on  consumption  smoothing.  The 
coefficients  suggest  that  international  consumption  risk  sharing  in  Germany  is  primarily 
achieved by countercyclical net foreign income, whereas external saving tends to go along 
with  business  cycles.  This  outcome  holds  for  both  overall  consumption  smoothing  and 
consumption smoothing vis-à-vis other euro-area countries only.

Obviously, your paper goes beyond these simple correlations. It clearly identifies the impact 
of cross border banking integration and uses more sophisticated econometric techniques. I 
highly  appreciate  your  work  and  consider  it  a  valuable  contribution  to  the  current  debate. 
Nevertheless, I would like to stress that this interesting topic leaves much room for further 
research. 
Concluding remarks 
5 
To conclude, both papers are very instructive in terms of learning more about details of the 
ongoing  process  of  financial  integration  in  the  European  Monetary  Union.  They  have  both 
shown that cross-border risk-sharing has improved during the past decade and that EMU has 
given a major stimulus to this. Our own calculations on the German home bias point in the 
same direction. These approaches, therefore, allow us to conclude that EMU has  welfare-
enhancing effects.  
The Eurosystem will do its best to make them come to the fore with full force in the years to 
come.
