L Wilson Kamit: Central bank independence – the first seven years 
Paper presented by Mr L Wilson Kamit, CBE, Governor of the Bank of Papua New Guinea, 
at  the  2008  Waigani  Seminar,  University  of  Papua  New  Guinea,  Port  Moresby,  14  August 
2008. 
 Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, may I firstly thank the Organising Committee for 
the invitation to participate in the 2008 Waigani Seminar.  
I  propose  to  discuss  our  experiences  on  governance  issues  at  the  Bank  of  Papua  New 
Guinea during the last seven years. The book “Money and Banking in Papua New Guinea” 
(BPNG,  2nd  edition  2007)  provides  detailed  discussion  on  the  country’s  development 
policies, the Central Bank, macroeconomic management and how the economy performed 
from 1973 to 2005. 
My talk is divided into three parts:

Background  
1.  
Following the attainment of nationhood in 1975, PNG went through a phase of low but steady 
economic  growth  until  1989.  The  1990s,  often  referred  to  as  the  “lost  decade”  was 
characterized by serious management challenges by successive Governments. The closure 
of the Bougainville copper mine in 1989, excessive government spending over and above the 
appropriated amounts and a run down on the foreign exchange reserves led to the balance 
of  payments  crisis  and  the  abandonment  of  the  Hard  Kina  Strategy  in  1994.  Again,  gross 
fiscal  mismanagement  and  a  break-down  in  good  governance  combined  with  the  El  Niño 
drought  of  1997/98,  the  Sandline  crisis,  and  the  Asian  Financial  Crisis  led  to  the  country 
facing near-financial collapse at the end of the 1990’s.  
The  financial  system  came  under  stress  during  this  time.  Government  financing  through 
borrowings  from  the  central  bank  reached  its  height.  A  good  portion  of  the  increased 
government  spending  was  for  imports,  which  led  to  a  high  usage  of  the  already  low 
international reserve levels. These had the effect of: limiting the effectiveness of the central 
bank’s operations; increased money supply; very high level of liquidity and increased interest 
rates; depreciation of the kina; and high inflation.  
Political  influence  through  frequent  changes  to  the  Bank’s  Governors  disrupted  monetary 
policy management. Between 1997 and 1999, we had four Governors, one stayed for only 
four months.  
There  was  a  break-down  in  governance,  serious  mismanagement,  fraud  and  outright  theft 
that  contributed  to  the  stress  within  the  financial  system.  The  Government-owned 
commercial bank, controlling fifty percent of the banking business, was mismanaged and on 
the verge of insolvency. Pyramid (Ponzi or fast-money) schemes were flourishing, supported 
by people in authority, and a large superannuation fund was close to bankruptcy as a result 
of corrupt practices by the trustees and management. In all the large superannuation funds, 
total  ignorance  and  incompetence  of  management,  board  and  ministerial  control  on  the 
decision  making  process,  resulted  in  serious  failures.  There  was  lack  of  confidence  in  the 
financial system and the economic management of the country, which also contributed to the 
depreciation of the kina.

Life Insurance Act. 
Given all these developments, it was apparent that major reforms were needed to enable the 
central bank to rectify the problems within the financial system and instil confidence in the 
economy.  Reforms  to  the  financial  sector  were  part  of  an  overall  structural  reform 
programme  introduced  by  the  Government  that  included  strengthening  public  expenditure 
control,  enhancing  the  effectiveness  and  transparency  of  development  spending,  initiating 
privatisation of and instilling operational discipline in large state enterprises and carrying out 
comprehensive civil service reforms. 
The legislations governing the Central Bank’s operations and activities were considerably out 
of date by the end of the 1990’s. The Government therefore decided to revamp the whole 
financial sector by introducing four new major pieces of legislation. These are the:

The Bank of PNG still administers the Savings and Loan Societies Act 1995 and is in the 
final stages of replacing it with a modernised legislative framework for this segment of the 
financial system. 
My presentation will concentrate on the Central Banking Act as this relates to “central bank 
independence”  and  governance  issues  relating  to  the  financial  system  under  the  Bank’s 
regulatory responsibility. 
The Bank of PNG currently has regulatory oversight over 58 licensed financial institutions. 
There  are  4  commercial  banks,  9  finance  companies,  2  micro-finance  institutions  and  21 
savings & loan societies. There are 14 institutions in the superannuation industry, comprising

administrators. Of the 8 in the life insurance industry, 5 are life insurance companies and 3 
are  brokers.  The  table  and  chart  below  indicates  the  growth  in  asset  size  of  the  licensed 
financial institutions since the reforms began in 2000.

Central bank reforms 
2.  
Central  to  the  financial  sector  reforms  were  structural  reforms  at  the  Bank  of  PNG,  which 
were considered necessary to achieving stability of the economy in the medium term. Giving 
the  Central  Bank  more  independence  and  power  in  the  conduct  of  monetary  policy  and 
strengthening financial sector supervision was in line with worldwide trends. The consensus 
in the 1990s was that central banks contribute positively to economic stability and maintain 
credibility  if  they  have  a  sufficient  degree  of  autonomy  and  are  independent  of  political 
interference. 
When designing our new Central Banking Act, we had the opportunity to access assistance 
from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  and  the  World  Bank  We  also  looked  at  the 
British, Australian, New Zealand, Israel, Hong Kong and Singapore experiences.  
Whilst we consulted widely, the new legislation was our own product, using the world’s best 
practises but tailored to PNG’s conditions. It is not a mirror image of other legislations and is 
at the forefront of financial sector legislation. 
The Central Banking Act 2000 was enacted by Parliament in April 2000. It had the following 
features that give greater central bank independence. 
1) 
A clear and focused set of objectives – monetary policy objective of achieving and 
maintaining price stability which is used by the central banks of all Organization of 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries as the main objective if 
not the only one.  
Independent  from  Government  involvement  and  implementation  of  central  bank’s 
policy  and  operational  functions  –  the  Governor  is  solely  responsible  and 
accountable  for  monetary  policy.  The  Governor  also  has  sole  responsibility  for 
licensing  and  supervising  the  financial  system,  exchange  rate  management,  and 
exchange control regulations. 
An  independent  Governor  –  The  Governor  is  appointed  by  the  Head  of  State 
(Governor General), acting on advice, for a term of between 5 and 7 years, beyond 
the electoral cycle, and is limited to 2 consecutive terms (not more than 14 years) 
The removal of a Governor is on the recommendation of the Bank Board.  
Government financing from the central bank is limited to an overdraft of K112 million 
for  bridging  finance  purposes  only  (for  short-term  cashflow  mismatches)  and  is 
repayable within 6 months. Access to the facility is at the discretion of the Governor. 
Independent Board – comprising the Governor who is also the Chairman, the two 
Deputy  Governors  and  a  wide  community  representation  with  five  ex-officio 
members  (presidents  of  the  PNG  Council  of  Churches,  Chamber  of  Commerce, 
PNG  Trade  Union  Congress  and  Institute  of  Accountants,  and  Chairman  of  the 
Securities Commission). The Minister can appoint 3 members (non ex-officio) to the 
Board.  
2) 
3) 
4) 
5) 
As  with  the Central  Banking  Act,  the  new  Banks  and  Financial  Institutions  Act  (BFIA)  was 
enacted in 2000 which broadened and improved the regulation, supervision and control of 
the  banks  and  finance  companies,  introducing  international  best  practises.  The  Bank  also 
assumed regulatory oversight of the life insurance and superannuation industries. With the 
exception  of  the  general  insurance  industry,  the  National  Development  Bank,  the  Port 
Moresby Stock Exchange and a Unit Trust, the Bank of PNG is now basically overseeing the 
whole financial system.  
Our experiences 
3. 
Granting greater independence to central banks is now seen as important to ensuring sound 
monetary  policy  management  and  implementation.  Our  experiences  show  that  legislation 
BIS Review 99/2008

changes were crucial to guaranteeing central bank independence. This however had to be 
undertaken within the context of an overall reform package for the whole finance industry. 
Piece-meal legislative changes, on their own, are not effective. There has to be political will 
to  ensure  these  changes  take  place.  The  Central  Bank  independence  was  reaffirmed  in  a 
public  announcement  by  the  Treasurer  in  November  2007.  This  was  done  to  dispel 
comments that the independence of the central bank should be curtailed or diluted.  
Formulation and conduct of monetary policy for price stability 
In  carrying  out  its  responsibilities  under  increased  independence,  the  Central  Bank  has  to 
perform and be more accountable and transparent to the Parliament and the public.  
Before 2000, monetary policy was formulated for a year horizon and announced in the first 
quarter of each year. The objective of monetary policy was broadly stated as that of providing 
sufficient liquidity for the non-mineral private sector to grow at a sustainable rate. Monetary 
policy  was  accommodative  of  fiscal  operations  of  the  Government  and  preoccupied  with 
financing fiscal deficits, especially in the 1990s. The formal process involved the Governor 
presenting  the  monetary  policy  stance  to  the  Bank  Board  for  its  approval.  Then  it  is 
forwarded to the Finance Minister for his endorsement. There can arise a conflict of interest 
between fiscal and monetary policy, and issue governance and integrity of monetary policy.  
From July 2000, under the Central Banking Act 2000, debt management and monetary policy 
per  se  were  clearly  separated  with  a  clear  and  specific  objective  for  the  latter  –  that  of 
achieving  and  maintaining  price  stability.  The  Bank  can  formulate  monetary  policy  for  any 
term it decides. For transparency purposes it must report to the public on a six-monthly basis 
a Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), which involves a review of the monetary policy stance 
and  if  necessary  a  change  in  the  stance  is  made.  Under  the  Act  the  Governor  has  the 
authority  and  mandate  to  decide  on  and  implement  the  monetary  policy  stance  without 
having  to  go  to  the  Board  and  the  Treasury  Minister  for  their  approval  as  was  the  case 
previously. 
Price  stability  entails  low  inflation,  low  interest  rates  and  stable  exchange  rate.  Our  own 
research  (Sampson,  Nindim,  Marambini  and  Yabom,  2005)1  shows  there  is  a  strong  link 
between  exchange  rate  movements  and  inflation.  Given  this  link,  the  Bank  ensures  that 
volatility  in  the  exchange  rate  is  smoothened  out  through  its  intervention  in  the  foreign 
exchange market on either side of the market,  while not trying to determine the long term 
trend  of  kina  exchange  rate  nor  targeting  a  specific  rate.  Stability  in  the  exchange  rate, 
together with other factors such as prudent fiscal management, can then lead to stability in 
price and other macroeconomic conditions.  
Complementing  the  MPS  is  the  monthly  announcement  of  the  monetary  policy  stance 
through the key short-term policy interest rate – the Kina Facility Rate (KFR), introduced in 
February 2001. 
For effective management of monetary policy the Bank has introduced new instruments such 
as  Central  Bank  Bills  and  Repurchase  Agreements,  and  put  in  place  new  prudential 
requirements  and  standards 
financial  system.  Operational 
arrangements have been implemented for a transparent and market-related relationship with 
the Government, including an Agency Agreement for our role as banker to the Government 
and agent for trade in government securities and the registry function.  
The legislative reforms in 2000, prudent management of fiscal and monetary policies in the 
2000s,  increased  foreign  exchange  reserves  and  the  stability  in  exchange  rate  –  driven 
largely by the high international commodity prices, have enabled the Central Bank to achieve 
for  supervision  of

 Supervision 
With respect to supervision, our independence allowed us to clean up the financial sector. In 
2000,  we  replaced  the  board  and  management  of  the  troubled  Government-owned  PNG 
Banking  Corporation.  It  was  revamped  and  successfully  sold  off  under  the  Government’s 
privatisation programme in 2002. The commercial banks were able to perform well following 
the reforms. The chart below shows the decline in non performing loans (NPLs) since 1999.

The clean up process included closing down 86 dormant savings and loan societies, placed 
other  financial  institutions  under  management,  with  a  view  of  enabling  them  to  trade 
themselves  back  into  business,  and  liquidated  a  number  of  financial  institutions  that  have 
been mismanaged and were beyond rescue. The Superannuation Act also enabled the Bank 
to  effectively  supervise  the  industry  as  reflected  in  the  chart  below,  which  shows  a  rapid 
increase in the profitability of the superannuation industry.

community and the general public is also an important element of good governance. Regular 
consultations take place at the senior management and technical levels, explaining changes 
to policy or operations with the other stakeholders (Government, commercial banks, etc). For 
this,  we  must  be  objective  in  the  advice  we  give  and  be  professionally  and  technically 
competent  in  the  analytical  work  we  do.  The  success  of  any  changes  introduced  by  the 
Central Bank depended on the support and cooperation of others within the financial system 
and the community. 
For Papua New Guinea, we had to act at a time of crisis, which is not the most desirable 
environment to implement such reforms. However, in my judgement, the outcomes were very 
favourable and the results very positive. 
The way ahead 
There  are  several  challenges  we  face  at  the  Central  Bank  as  we  move  into  the  new 
millennium. These are: 
•
