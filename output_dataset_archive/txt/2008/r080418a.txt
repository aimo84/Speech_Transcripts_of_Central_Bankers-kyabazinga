Jean-Pierre Roth: Foreign trade is Switzerland’s growth driver 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the 
Swiss  National  Bank  and  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Bank  for  International 
Settlements, at OSEC Business Network Switzerland, Zurich, 17 April 2008. 
The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 Foreign trade has played a major role during the present economic cycle. Over the past two 
years,  it  has  made  an  exceptional  contribution  to  GDP  growth  –  with  figures  that  bear 
comparison to the two upswing periods of the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. This strong export 
performance  not  only  reflects  a  reorientation  to  accommodate  the  world  economy’s  new 
growth hubs, but is also the result of successful sector specialisation and the Swiss export 
industry’s  premium-quality  positioning.  Switzerland’s  watchmaking  and  pharmaceutical 
industries have been particularly impressive in this regard. Thanks to the speed at which its 
export  industry  has  been  able  to  adapt  to  global  demand,  Switzerland  is  well  placed  to 
benefit from the prevailing increase in earnings within the emerging markets. 
By  specialising  in  the  technology  segment  and  tailoring  its  exports  to  customer  needs, 
Switzerland is not only able to reap the rewards of upswings in the global economic cycle. 
With  the  world  economy  now  beginning  to  catch  a  cold  from  the  slowdown  in  the  US 
economy,  the  quality  and  competitiveness  of  our  exports  means  that  our  companies  are 
better equipped than others to hold their own in the global marketplace. Foreign trade not 
only represents Switzerland's growth driver, but it is also our friend when economic times are 
hard.
