Philipp M Hildebrand: Economic outlook and monetary policy 
Speech  by  Mr  Philipp  M  Hildebrand,  Member  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Swiss  National  Bank, 
Apéritif Marché monétaire, Geneva, 17 November 2005. 
The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 The Swiss economy has benefited from a favourable international environment. Activity has remained 
strong in the US, whereas it has improved in Japan and, more recently, in Europe. In Switzerland also, 
the  latest  indicators  point  towards  stronger  growth.  Exports  remain  the  engine  of  the  recovery  but 
private consumption has also picked up. However, consumer confidence remains fragile in the context 
of  only  modestly  improving  labour  market  conditions.  The  SNB  expects  the  economic  recovery  to 
continue. A sudden adjustment of the US current account imbalance or a further increase of energy 
prices are predominant risks. 
From a monetary point of view, the current situation is characterised by different counteracting forces. 
On the one hand, the economic outlook is positive. On the other hand, some risks put this favourable 
picture  into  perspective.  Furthermore,  the  increase  of  energy  prices  might  endanger  medium  term 
price stability at a time when monetary conditions remain expansive. Last but not least, globalisation 
continues  to  hold  down  the  prices  of  many  goods.  In  this  complex  environment,  it  is  important  that 
central  banks  succeed  in  preserving  their  most  important  monetary  asset,  namely  well  anchored 
inflation expectations. In Switzerland, this means that as long as the economic recovery remains on 
track, we should not postpone for too long the process of normalising monetary conditions. Otherwise, 
we would put medium term price stability at risk.
