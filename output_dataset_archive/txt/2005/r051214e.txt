V Leeladhar: Taking banking services to the common man - financial inclusion  
Commemorative  lecture  by  Mr  V  Leeladhar,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India,  at  the 
Fedbank Hormis Memorial Foundation, Ernakulam, 2 December 2005. 
 Ladies and Gentlemen, 
I am truly honoured to deliver the Fedbank Hormis Memorial Foundation commemorative lecture. The 
illustrious list of the previous years’ speakers indicates the kind of significance this commemorative 
lecture  has  acquired  over  the  years.  The  late  Shri  K.P.Hormis,  founder  of  Federal  Bank,  was  a 
visionary  and  left  behind  an  institutional  set  up  in  the  form  of  Federal  Bank  which  has  been  doing 
yeoman service for well over seventy five years. The Fedbank Hormis Memorial Foundation, a public 
charitable  trust,  has  been  furthering  the  cause  of  banking  and  finance  by  providing  knowledge  and 
training in the areas of banking, finance, economics and management to banking professionals as well 
as  deserving  students  who  are  specializing  in  these  areas.  As  the  life  and  times  of  late  Shri 
K.P.Hormis were spent largely in taking banking to the masses, which is indicated by Federal Bank’s 
mix of urban and rural coverage, I thought it would be appropriate for me to speak on taking banking 
services to the common man – financial inclusion, a topic of contemporary significance and relevance.  
The  banking  industry  has  shown  tremendous  growth  in  volume  and  complexity  during  the  last  few 
decades.  Despite  making  significant  improvements  in  all  the  areas  relating  to  financial  viability, 
profitability  and  competitiveness,  there  are  concerns  that  banks have  not  been  able  to  include  vast 
segment of the population, especially the underprivileged sections of the society, into the fold of basic 
banking services. Internationally also efforts are being made to study the causes of financial exclusion 
and  designing  strategies  to  ensure  financial  inclusion  of  the  poor  and  disadvantaged.  The  reasons 
may vary from country to country and hence the strategy could also vary but all out efforts are being 
made as financial inclusion can truly lift the financial condition and standards of life of the poor and the 
disadvantaged. 
What is financial inclusion? 
• 
Financial inclusion is delivery of banking services at an affordable cost to the vast sections of 
disadvantaged and low income groups. Unrestrained access to public goods and services is 
the sine qua non of an open and efficient society. As banking services are in the nature of 
public  good,  it  is  essential  that  availability  of  banking  and  payment  services  to  the  entire 
population without discrimination is the prime objective of the public policy.  
The scope of financial inclusion  
The scope of financial inclusion can be expanded in two ways.  
a) 
through  state-driven  intervention  by  way  of  statutory  enactments  (for  instance  the  US 
example,  the  Community  Reinvestment  Act  and  making  it  a  statutory  right  to  have  bank 
account in France). 
through  voluntary  effort  by  the  banking  community  itself  for  evolving  various  strategies  to 
bring within the ambit of the banking sector the large strata of society. 
b) 
When  bankers  do  not  give  the  desired  attention  to  certain  areas,  the  regulators  have  to  step  in  to 
remedy the situation. This is the reason why the Reserve Bank of India is placing a lot of emphasis on 
financial inclusion. 
In India the focus of the financial inclusion at present is confined to ensuring a bare minimum access 
to a savings bank account without frills, to all. Internationally, the financial exclusion has been viewed 
in a much wider perspective. Having a current account / savings account on its own, is not regarded 
as an accurate indicator of financial inclusion. There could be multiple levels of financial inclusion and 
exclusion. At one extreme, it is possible to identify the ‘super-included’, i.e., those customers who are 
actively and persistently courted by the financial services industry, and who have at their disposal a 
wide  range  of  financial  services  and  products.  At  the  other  extreme,  we  may  have  the  financially

excluded, who are denied access to even the most basic of financial products. In between are those 
who  use  the  banking services  only  for deposits  and  withdrawals of  money.  But  these  persons  may 
have only restricted access to the financial system, and may not enjoy the flexibility of access offered 
to more affluent customers.  
Consequences of financial exclusion 
Consequences of financial exclusion will vary depending on the nature and extent of services denied. 
It may lead to increased travel requirements, higher incidence of crime, general decline in investment, 
difficulties in gaining access to credit or getting credit from informal sources at exorbitant rates, and 
increased unemployment, etc. The small business may suffer due to loss of access to middle class 
and higher-income consumers, higher cash handling costs, delays in remittances of money. According 
to certain researches, financial exclusion can lead to social exclusion.  
International experience in promoting financial inclusion  
An interesting feature which emerges from the international practice is that the more developed the 
society is, the greater the thrust on empowerment of the common person and low income groups. It 
may be worthwhile to have a look at the international experience in tackling the problem of financial 
exclusion so that we can learn from the international experience.  
The Financial Inclusion Task Force in UK has identified three priority areas for the purpose of financial 
inclusion, viz., access to banking, access to affordable credit and access to free face-to-face money 
advice.  UK  has  established  a  Financial  Inclusion  Fund  to  promote  financial  inclusion  and  assigned 
responsibility to banks and credit unions in removing financial exclusion. Basic bank no frills accounts 
have been introduced. An enhanced legislative environment for credit unions has been established, 
accompanied  by  tighter  regulations  to  ensure  greater  protection  for  investors.  A  Post  Office  Card 
Account  (POCA)  has  been  created  for  those  who  are  unable  or  unwilling  to  access  a  basic  bank 
account.  The  concept  of  a  Savings  Gateway  has  been  piloted.  This  offers  those  on  low-income 
employment £1 from the state for every £1 they invest, up to a maximum of £25 per month. In addition 
the Community Finance Learning Initiatives (CFLIs) were also introduced with a view to promoting 
basic financial literacy among housing association tenants.  
A  civil  rights  law,  namely  Community  Reinvestment  Act  (CRA)  in  the  United  States  prohibits 
discrimination  by  banks  against  low  and  moderate  income  neighborhoods.  The  CRA  imposes  an 
affirmative and continuing obligations on banks to serve the needs for credit and banking services of 
all  the  communities  in  which  they  are  chartered.  In  fact,  numerous  studies  conducted  by  Federal 
Reserve and Harvard University demonstrated that CRA lending is a win-win proposition and profitable 
to banks. In this context, it is also interesting to know the other initiative taken by a state in the United 
States. Apart from the CRA experiment, armed with the sanction of Banking Law, the State of New 
York  Banking  Department,  with  the  objective  of  making  available  the  low  cost  banking  services  to 
consumers,  made  mandatory  that  each  banking  institution  shall  offer  basic  banking  account  and  in 
case of credit unions the basic share draft account, which is in the nature of low cost account with 
minimum facilities. Some key features of the basic banking account are worth-mentioning here. 
• 
• 
the initial deposit amount required to open the account shall not exceed US $ 25 
the  minimum  balance,  including  any  average  balance,  required  to  maintain  such  account 
shall not exceed US $ 0.10 
the charge for periodic cycle for the maintenance of such accounts to be declared up front 
the  minimum  number  of  withdrawal  transactions  which  may  be  made  during  any  periodic 
cycle at no charge to the account   holder must at least be eight 
a  withdrawal  shall  be  deemed  to  be  made  when  recorded  on  the  books  of  the  account 
holder’s banking institution 
except,  as  provided  below,  an  account  holder  shall  not  be  restricted  as  to  the  number  of 
deposits which may be made to the account without incurring any additional charge 
the  banking  institution  may  charge  account  holders  for  transactions  at  electronic  facilities 
which  are  not  operated  by  the  account  holder’s  banking  institution  as  well  as  other  fees 
    2 
 BIS Review 83/2005
 and charges for specific banking services which are not covered under the basic banking 
 
account scheme 
every periodic statement issued for the basic banking account should invariably cover on it 
or by way of separate  communiqué maximum number of withdrawals permitted  during  each 
periodic cycle without additional charge and the consequences of exceeding such maximum 
and the fee if any, for the use of electronic facilities which are not operated by the account 
holder’s banking institution. 
An interesting feature of basic banking account scheme is the element of transparency i.e. the banking 
institution  should,  prior  to  opening  the  account,  furnish  a  written  disclosure  to  the  account  holder 
describing  the  main  features  of  the  scheme  i.e.  the  initial  deposit  amount  required  to  open  the 
account,  minimum  balance  to  be  maintained,  charge  per  periodic  cycle  for  use  of  such  account, 
maximum  number  of  withdrawal  transactions  without  any  additional  charge  and  other  charges 
imposed on transactions for availing electronic facility not operated by the account holder’s banking 
institution, etc.

Indian scenario 
Bank nationalization in India marked a paradigm shift in the focus of banking as it was intended to shift 
the focus from class banking to mass banking. The rationale for creating Regional Rural Banks was 
also to take the banking services to poor people. The branches of commercial banks and the RRBs 
have  increased  from  8321  in  the  year  1969  to  68,282  branches  as  at  the  end  of  March  2005.  The 
average population per branch office has decreased from 64,000 to 16,000 during the same period. 
However,  there  are  certain  under-banked  states  such  as  Bihar,  Orissa,  Rajasthan,  Uttar  Pradesh, 
Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, West Bengal and a large number of North-Eastern states, where the average 
population  per  branch  office  continues  to  be  quite  high  compared  to  the  national  average.  As  you 
would  be  aware,  the  new  branch  authorization  policy  of  Reserve  Bank  encourages  banks  to  open 
branches in these under banked states and the under banked areas in other states. The new policy 
also places a lot of emphasis on the efforts made by the Bank to achieve, inter alia, financial inclusion 
and other policy objectives.  
One of the benchmarks employed to assess the degree of reach of financial services to the population 
of the country, is the quantum of deposit accounts (current and savings) held as a ratio to the adult 
population.  In  the  Indian  context,  taking  into  account  the  Census  of  2001  (ignoring  the  incremental 
growth of population thereafter), the ratio of deposit accounts (data available as on March 31, 2004) to 
the total adult population was only 59% (details furnished in the table). Within the country, there is a 
wide variation across states. For instance, the ratio for the state of Kerala is as high as 89% while 
Bihar is marked by a low coverage of 33%. In the North Eastern States like Nagaland and Manipur, 
the coverage was a meager 21% and 27%, respectively. The Northern Region, comprising the states 
of  Haryana,  Chandigarh  and  Delhi,  has  a  high  coverage  ratio  of  84%.  Compared  to  the  developed 
world,  the  coverage  of  our  financial  services  is  quite  low.  For  instance,  as  per  a  recent  survey 
commissioned by British Bankers' Association, 92 to 94% of the population of UK has either current or 
savings bank account.  
Steps towards financial inclusion 
In  the  context  of  initiatives  taken  for  extending  banking  services  to  the  small  man,  the  mode  of 
financial sector development until 1980’s was characterized by  
• 
a hugely expanded bank branch and cooperative network and new organizational forms like 
RRBs; 
a  greater  focus  on  credit  rather  than  other  financial  services  like  savings  and  insurance, 
although the banks and cooperatives did provide deposit facilities; 
lending targets directed at a range of ‘priority sectors’ such as agriculture, weaker sections of 
the population, etc; 
interest rate ceilings; 
significant government subsidies channeled through the banks and cooperatives, as well as 
through related government programmes; 
BIS Review 83/2005
   4 
  a dominant perspective that finance for rural and poor people was a social obligation and not 
a potential business opportunity. 
It is absolutely beyond any doubt that the financial access to masses has significantly improved in the 
last three and a half decades. But the basic question is, has that been good enough. As I mentioned 
earlier, the quantum of deposit accounts (current and savings) held as a ratio to the adult population 
has not been uniformly encouraging. There is a tremendous scope for financial coverage if we have to 
improve the standards of life of those deprived people.  
With a view to enhancing the financial inclusion, as a proactive measure, the RBI in its Annual Policy 
Statement for the year 2005-06, while recognizing the concerns in regard to the banking practices that 
tend  to  exclude  rather  than  attract  vast  sections  of  population,  urged  banks  to  review  their  existing 
practices to align them with the objective of financial inclusion. In the Mid Term Review of the Policy 
(2005-06),  RBI  exhorted  the  banks,  with  a  view  to  achieving  greater  financial  inclusion,  to  make 
available  a  basic  banking  ‘no  frills’  account  either  with  nil  or  very  minimum  balances  as  well  as 
charges that would make such accounts accessible to vast sections of the population. The nature and 
number  of  transactions  in  such  accounts  would  be  restricted  and  made  known  to  customers  in 
advance in a transparent manner. All banks are urged to give wide publicity to the facility of such no 
frills account so as to ensure greater financial inclusion.  
Further, in order to ensure that persons belonging to low income group both in urban and rural areas 
do not face difficulty in opening the bank accounts due to the procedural hassles, the KYC procedure 
for  opening  accounts  has  been  simplified  for  those  persons  who  intend  to  keep  balances  not 
exceeding rupees fifty thousand (Rs. 50,000/-) in all their accounts taken together and the total credit 
in all the accounts taken together is not expected to exceed rupees one lakh (Rs.1,00,000/-) in a year.  
The way forward  
The  banks  should  come  out  of  inhibited  feeling  that  very  aggressive  competition  policy  and  social 
inclusion are mutually exclusive. As demonstrated elsewhere, the mass banking with no-frills etc. can 
become a win-win situation for both. Basically banking services need to be “marketed” to connect with 
large  population  segments  and  these  may  be  justifiable  promotional  costs.  The  opportunities  are 
plenty. 
• 
In  the  context  of  India  becoming  one  of  the  largest  micro  finance  markets  in  the  world 
especially in the growth of women’s savings and credit groups (SHGs) and the sustaining 
success of such institutions which has been demonstrated by the success of SEWA bank in 
Gujarat, low cost banking is not necessarily an unviable venture/proposition.  
The IBA may explore the possibility of a survey about the coverage in respect of financial 
inclusion  keeping  in  view  the  geographical  spread  of  the  banks  and  extent  of  financial 
services available to the population so as to assess the constraints in extension of financial 
services to hitherto unbanked sections and for initiating appropriate policy measures. 
It  may  be  useful  for  banks  to  consider  franchising  with  other  segments  of  financial  sector 
such  as  cooperatives,  RRBs  etc.  so  as  to  extend  the  scope  of  financial  inclusion  with 
minimal intermediation cost. 
Since  large  sections  of  low  income  groups  transactions  are  related  to  deposits  and 
withdrawals, with a view to containing transaction costs, 'simple to use' cash dispensing and 
collecting machines akin to ATMs, with operating instructions and commands in vernacular 
would  greatly  facilitate  financial  inclusion  of  the  semi  urban  and  rural  populace.  In  this 
regard, it is worthwhile to emulate the example of ‘e-Choupal’ project brought forth through 
private sector initiative. 
   Conclusion  
It is becoming increasingly apparent that addressing financial exclusion will require a holistic approach 
on  the  part  of  the  banks  in  creating  awareness  about  financial  products,  education,  and  advice  on 
money management, debt counseling, savings and affordable credit. The banks would have to evolve 
specific strategies to expand the outreach of their services in order to promote financial inclusion. One 
of the ways in which this can be achieved in a cost-effective manner is through forging linkages with 
BIS Review 83/2005

microfinance institutions and local communities. Banks should give wide publicity to the facility of no 
frills  account.  Technology  can  be  a  very  valuable  tool  in  providing  access  to  banking  products  in 
remote areas. ATMs cash dispensing machines can be modified suitably to make them user friendly 
for people who are illiterate, less educated or do not know English.  
To sum up, banks need to redesign their business strategies to incorporate specific plans to promote 
financial inclusion of low income group treating it both a business opportunity as well as a corporate 
social  responsibility.  They  have  to  make  use  of  all  available  resources  including  technology  and 
expertise available with them as well as the MFIs and NGOs. It may appear in the first instance that 
taking  banking  to  the  sections  constituting  “the  bottom  of  the  pyramid”,  may  not  be  profitable  but  it 
should always be remembered that even the relatively low margins on high volumes can be a very 
profitable  proposition.  Financial  inclusion  can  emerge  as  commercial  profitable  business.  Only  the 
banks should be prepared to think outside the box!
