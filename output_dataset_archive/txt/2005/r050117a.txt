Philipp M Hildebrand: Liquidity - a challenge for banks 
Public  lecture  by  Dr  Philipp  M  Hildebrand,  Member  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Swiss  National 
Bank, at the Swiss National Bank Conference “Liquidity - a challenge for banks”, Zurich, 11 January 
2005. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 The resilience of the international financial system has been strengthened in recent years thanks to 
the extensive efforts of financial institutions, central banks and regulatory bodies. Nonetheless, given 
the steadily increasing volume of transactions in global financial markets, securing liquidity remains a 
fundamental task for banks. 
During times of crises, liquidity can suddenly contract or dry up altogether. The challenge for banks is 
to  set  up  liquidity  planning  procedures  to  secure  reliable  liquidity  sources  for  exceptional 
circumstances.  Liquidity  risks  must  be  correctly  assessed  and  assets  must  be  secured  to  serve  as 
collateral when necessary. 
In Switzerland, the repo market is the forward-looking liquidity management instrument for the banks. 
It  minimises  counterparty  risk  in  lending  and  provides  access  to  a  crisis-resistant,  collateralised 
interbank market. The Swiss National Bank is itself a participant in the repo market. It uses the repo 
platform  to  implement  monetary  policy  and  to  provide  for  liquidity  in  both  normal  and  exceptional 
circumstances.
