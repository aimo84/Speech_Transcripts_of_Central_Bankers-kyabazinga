Svante Öberg: The current economic situation 
Speech by Mr Svante Öberg, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at Kulturens 
hus, Luleå, 18 August 2009. 
 It gives me particular pleasure to come to Luleå to talk about the economic situation. This is 
because my father, Folke Öberg, was born and raised in Luleå and he began working at the 
Riksbank here in 1930. This is also where he met my mother, Margareta. In the 1930s they 
moved to Stockholm, where my father began working at the Riksbank’s head office, where 
he was employed until his retirement in 1972. The local offices that the Riksbank previously 
had in each county, including here in Luleå, have long been closed down and activities are 
now concentrated in Stockholm.  
What I intend to say here today can be summarised in three points: 
• 
• 
The deep recession has hit bottom, but the recovery will be weak. 
New information received over the summer tends to indicate a slightly stronger GDP 
growth than we have forecast, but the labour market is continuing to weaken and 
inflation is low.  
Monetary policy is aimed at dampening the economic downturn. The repo rate was 
cut to an all-time low of 0.25 per cent in July and is expected to remain at this low 
level for the coming year. 
 In  my  speech  today  I  will  present  the  Riksbank’s  assessment  of  economic  developments 
both  in  Sweden  and  abroad.  This  is  the  assessment  that  was  described  in  the  Monetary 
Policy  Report  published  on  2  July  this  year.  I  will  also  comment  on  the  new  information 
received  over  the  summer.  Finally,  I  shall  report  how  the  majority  of  Executive  Board 
members and I personally viewed monetary policy in July. But I shall began by describing 
developments in the financial markets, which are both the reason for the economic downturn 
being so severe and a necessary condition for growth to pick up again. 
Financial markets  
Improved situation in the financial markets 
The situation in the financial markets has improved over the past six months both in Sweden 
and abroad. Risk premiums in the interbank market, for instance the TED and basis spreads, 
have fallen and are now close to the levels prevailing prior to the outbreak of the crisis two 
years ago (see Figure 1). This is a sign that the interbank market is functioning better. Other 
positive  signs  that  the  situation  in  the  financial  sector  has  stabilised  are  that  Swedish 
companies can once again take loans in the international capital market, that equity prices 
have risen and that the krona has strengthened. 
However, the problems in the financial sector are not over yet. Several other types of risk 
premium  are  still  at  higher  levels  than  prior  to  the  crisis,  for  instance,  credit  spreads  for 
companies  and  Credit  Default  Swaps.  Moreover,  the  banks’  loan  losses  will  probably 
increase (see Figure 2).1

The financial crisis has so far been less serious in Sweden than in many other countries. The 
Swedish banks are well capitalised. But they are also to a large degree dependent on the 
securities  markets  for  their  funding  and  they  have  expanded  substantially  in  the  Baltic 
countries. The greatest risk for Sweden therefore lies with the banks’ credit exposure to the 
Baltic countries.  
International developments 
Slow global recovery 
Over the past year, the global economy has been hit by the most rapid economic downturn 
since the Second World War. Economic developments abroad are very weak this year and 
much weaker than we had previously anticipated. Since September last year, the Riksbank 
has gradually revised down its forecasts for global GDP growth in 2009 from approximately 4 
per  cent  to  around  -1  per  cent  (see  Figure  3).  The  forecasts  in  the  most  recent  Monetary 
Policy  Report  are  no  exception,  but  for  the  first  time  they  only  involve  a  minor  downward 
adjustment.  
There  are  numerous  indications  that  the  severe  economic  downturn  has  now  touched 
bottom. During the spring there were increasing signs pointing to a slowdown in the heavy 
fall  in  world  GDP.  At  the  same  time  the  financial  markets  have  begun  to  function  more 
efficiently, which is an important condition for ensuring that the economic recovery will begin. 
World trade has also begun to show signs of stabilisation during the spring, after the earlier 
heavy fall in exports. But our assessment is that the recovery will be a slow one (see Figure 
4). 
The  view  that  a  recovery  in  the  world  economy  has  begun  is  also  confirmed  by  the  IMF’s 
most  recent  forecasts  for  global  developments.  However,  the  IMF  report  also  depicts  the 
recovery as being sluggish.2
Inflation abroad has continued to fall and has been negative in recent months, but underlying 
inflation has been more stable. I shall return to this point.  
Nevertheless, commodity prices have begun to rise. The oil price fell substantially last year, 
but has now risen again to around USD 75 per barrel, and according to forward rates it is 
expected to rise slightly during the forecast period (see Figure 5). The price rise may be a 
consequence of the expectation that demand will increase, but oil stocks are large and the 
OPEC  countries  have  good  capacity  to  increase  their  production,  which  should  have  a 
restraining  effect  on  the  oil  price.  Other  commodity  prices  –  metals,  foods  and  other 
agricultural products – have also risen in recent months (see Figure 6). 
USA 
The  United  States  is  currently  suffering  its  most  prolonged  recession  since  the  1940s.  It 
started back in December 2007. According to our most recent forecast, the US economy will 
shrink by an average of around 3 per cent in 2009. Growth is expected to be positive again 
with effect from next year. Since the monetary policy meeting in July the national accounts 
figures for the second quarter of this year have been published. They showed that GDP fell 
by only 0.3 per cent between the first and second quarters of this year, which was slightly 
better than we anticipated. Employment continued to fall in July, but less than expected, and 
unemployment  fell  by  a  tenth  of  a  percentage  point,  which  was  better  than  market 
expectations.

 BIS Review 98/2009
CPI inflation in the United States fell to -2.1 per cent in July, but when food and energy prices 
are excluded it fell to 1.5 per cent (see Figure 7). The underlying inflation rate measured in 
this  way  has  been  relatively  stable  in  recent  years  and  has  only  declined  slightly  over  the 
past year.  
An important condition for a turnaround and stabilisation in the US economy is that house 
prices touch bottom and begin to rise again. Developments in real house prices in the United 
States since 1950 comprise a good example of a price bubble (see Figure 8). The question 
now  is  how  far  house  prices  will  fall  before  the  turnaround  comes.  The  Federal  Reserve 
notes  in  its  most  recent  monetary  policy  report  that  developments  in  the  housing  market 
remain weak, although there are some signs of an improvement.3  
Euro area 
GDP growth in the euro area remains weak. According to the forecast in the Monetary Policy 
Report, GDP in the euro area will fall by an average of almost 5 per cent in 2009. Next year 
we are expecting largely zero growth and after that a fairly weak increase. Domestic demand 
in  particular  is  expected  to  be  weak  for  a  long  time  to  come  in  the  euro  area.  The  weak 
domestic  demand  means  that  the  euro  area  is  dependent  on  a  boost  from  abroad  –  in 
particular  the  United  States  and  other  important  trading  partners  –  to  be  able  to  make  a 
recovery.  
Since  the  Monetary  Policy  Report  was  published  statistics  received  from  Eurostat  have 
reinforced the picture of production in the euro area beginning to stabilise at a lower level 
following the heavy fall at the beginning of the year. GDP fell by only 0.1 per cent between 
the first and second quarters of the year, which was much better than we had estimated. In 
addition, it can be noted that the purchasing managers’ index for the euro area rose in July 
for the fifth month in a row (see Figure 9). Both the manufacturing and service sectors show 
an  improvement  in  July.  However,  the  index  is  still  below  50,  which  is  the  level  indicating 
growth.  Employment  is  continuing  to  be  weak  and  unemployment  rose  to  9.4  per  cent  in 
June.  
Inflation measured in terms of the EU harmonised index, the HICP, was -0.7 per cent in July. 
The HICP is not affected by interest rate cuts in the same way as the Swedish CPI, but it is 
affected  by  energy  prices.  HICP  inflation  excluding  energy,  which  is  a  measure  of  the 
underlying  inflation  rate,  was  1.0  per  cent  in  July.  In  the  euro  area,  too,  the  underlying 
inflation rate measured in this way has been relatively stable in recent years and declined 
considerably less than HICP inflation over the past year (see Figure 10).  
Rest of the world 
We are forecasting better growth for emerging markets and developing countries outside of 
the  OECD  than  for  the  OECD  countries.  This  view  is  supported  by  the  IMF's  most  recent 
update to its World Economic Outlook. The IMF writes that the global economy is beginning 
to pull out of the recession, but that the stabilisation is uneven between different regions and 
that  the  recovery  will  be  sluggish.  The  IMF,  for  example,  is  forecasting  strong  growth  in 
China and India both this year and next year (see Figure 11). However, the economies in 
Russia and Brazil are expected to shrink this year and then grow again next year.4

The  OECD’s  leading  economic  indicators  for  June  paint  a  slightly  brighter  picture  and 
indicate  that  economic developments  have  shown  a  turnaround  during  the  first  half  of  this 
year in all of the “BRIC” countries: Brazil, Russia, India and China.5
The current economic situation in Sweden 
In my review of the economic situation in Sweden I will focus on five areas: GDP, the labour 
market,  inflation,  the  current  account  and  public  finances.  My  experience  is  that  these 
variables usually provide a good picture of a country’s economic situation. 
Signs of a turnaround, but the recovery will be weak 
The Swedish economy has also been hard hit by the international economic downturn. We 
forecast in the Monetary Policy Report that GDP in Sweden will fall by more than 5 per cent 
this year (see Figure 12). However, during the spring there were several signs that the deep 
recession  may  have  bottomed  out.  The  financial  markets  have  begun  to  function  better, 
which creates opportunities for an economic recovery. World trade, which is very important 
for the Swedish economy, has also shown signs of stabilising during the spring.  
At  the  same  time,  we  believe  that  the  recovery  will  be  weak.  This  is  usually  the  case 
following serious financial crises. Our forecast is that GDP will not reach the same levels as 
prior to the start of the economic downturn in the second quarter of 2008 until 2012. 
Since the most recent monetary policy meeting there have been further signs to support the 
view  that  the  worst  is  now  over.  The  preliminary  national  accounts  published  on  31  July 
indicate that GDP remained unchanged between the first and second quarters of this year 
after four quarters of falling GDP (calendar-adjusted). This is a slightly better outcome than in 
our  July  forecast,  where  we  assumed  that  GDP  would  fall  by  0.3  per  cent  in  the  second 
quarter and that the fall would not come to a halt until the third quarter. However, there was 
unusually  great  uncertainty  regarding  the  preliminary  national  accounts  figures  on  this 
occasion. 
In  recent  months  various  confidence  indicators  have  also  shown  an  improvement.  The 
National  Institute  of  Economic  Research’s  Economic  Tendency  Survey,  which  summarises 
companies’  and  households’  views  of  the  economic  situation,  increased  by  almost  seven 
units in July, to 87.1. However, the level is still below 100 and indicates that the mood among 
companies  and  households  is  still  much  weaker  than  normal  (see  Figure  13).6  The 
purchasing managers’ index for July was also more positive than market expectations had 
implied. It rose by almost four units to 54.3 and was thus above 50 for the second month in a 
row (see Figure 14). The purchasing managers’ index is usually a slightly quicker indicator of 
developments than the economic tendency survey and an index above 50 indicates growth.7
Labour market continues to weaken 
Our assessment in the most recent Monetary Policy Report was that the labour market would 
continue to be weak. A deterioration in the labour market usually lags behind in an economic 
downturn, which was also the case this time. We are expecting employment to fall by around 
300,000  persons  from  the  peak  in  2008  to  a  trough  in  2011  and  that  unemployment  will 
continue to rise to around 11 per cent (see Figures 15 and 16)

 BIS Review 98/2009
After  the  recent  monetary  policy  meeting  new  information  was  received  from  the  Labour 
Force Surveys, which was roughly in line with our assessment. Employment fell by 1.7 per 
cent  in  June  compared  with  the  same  month  in  the  previous  year  and  unemployment 
increased to 9.8 per cent. This was respectively two-tenths and one-tenth of a percentage 
point better than we had forecast.8
Underlying inflation is in line with the inflation target of 2 per cent 
Inflation has fallen rapidly in recent months and is expected to become negative for a large 
part of the year. However, CPI inflation is strongly affected by interest rate changes and by 
changes  in  energy  prices.  It  is  therefore  better  to  study  the  underlying  inflation  rate. 
Underlying  inflation  measured  as  the  CPIF,  where  mortgage  rates  are  held  constant,  is 
expected to be close to 2 per cent throughout the forecast period (see Figure 17).  
New inflation figures published after the most recent monetary policy meeting have also been 
roughly in line with our assessments. CPI inflation was -0.9 per cent in July, which was three 
tenths of a percentage point lower than our forecast, but underlying inflation measured as the 
CPIF amounted to 1.8 per cent, which was entirely in line with our forecast.9  
Inflation measured in terms of the EU harmonised index, the HICP, was also 1.8 per cent in 
July  and  when  measured  as  the  HICP  excluding  energy  it  was  2.8  per  cent.  Inflation  was 
thus much higher in Sweden than in the EU. One reason for this is probably that the krona 
has weakened since last autumn. We are assuming that the weakening is mainly due to the 
financial  crisis  and  that  the  krona  will  strengthen  again.  Since  the  July  monetary  policy 
meeting,  however,  the  krona  has  strengthened  more  than  we  had  anticipated  (see  Figure 
18). Another reason is probably that unit labour costs have risen rapidly for three years in a 
row, mainly as a result of falling productivity, but also because of higher wage increases than 
before (see Figure 19).  
According to Prospera’s most recent survey in June, inflation expectations five years ahead 
were  2.2  per  cent  and  were  well-anchored  around  the  inflation  target.  However,  inflation 
expectations two years ahead are slightly below the inflation target (see Figure 20). 
The current account and public finances are strengths 
Sweden’s  current  account  and  public  finances can  be said  to  be  its  strengths.  These  look 
relatively good in comparison with other countries. Sweden had built up large surpluses in 
both its public finances and on its current account prior to the start of the crisis (see Figure 
21)  and  the  public  sector’s  indebtedness  is  low.  This  has  provided  a  greater  degree  of 
freedom with regard to managing the crisis.  
Public  finances  will  deteriorate  substantially  this  year  and  next  year  as  a  result  of 
expansionary  fiscal  policy  combined  with  a  decline  in  public  income  and  an  increase  in 
expenditure  related  to  unemployment,  etc.  as  a  result  of  the  economic  downturn.  Our 
assessment is that the public sector financial balance will fall from +4 per cent of GDP in the 
peak year 2007 to a trough of -4 per cent of GDP in 2010. But this is a much better situation 
than in many other countries, such as the United Kingdom, where public finances have also 
deteriorated substantially, but where they had a deficit to start with. The ambition in Sweden 
for public finances to show a surplus when regarded over an economic cycle has made it 
possible to dampen the economic downturn with an active fiscal policy without this leading to 
an unmanageably large deficit.

The  current  account  is  also  showing  large  surpluses.  Our  forecast  is  that  the  surplus  this 
year will correspond to around 7 per cent of GDP this year, despite exports being expected 
to fall by around 16 per cent. One reason for the large surplus in the current account is that 
exports have developed strongly since the early 1990s. At that time exports corresponded to 
around 30 per cent of GDP, but now the figure is around 50 per cent of GDP. This means at 
the same time that exports are very important to the Swedish economy and that the weak 
economic growth abroad therefore hits Sweden particularly hard. 
New information during the summer points to a slight improvement 
To summarise, the new information received during the summer tends to point to a slightly 
stronger  economic  activity  than  we  had  forecast  at  the  beginning  of  July.  GDP  was  three 
tenths of a percentage point better and employment fell two tenths of a percentage point less 
than we had forecast. A number of indicators have also exceeded market expectations. All in 
all,  this  supports  the  view  we  had  that  the  deep  economic  recession  has  bottomed  out. 
However, most indications are still that the recovery will be weak. Inflation fell slightly more 
than we had anticipated in July, but underlying inflation was in line with our forecasts. 
However, we will not make an overall assessment of economic developments until it is time 
for our next monetary policy decision on 2 September. It is likely that more information will 
have come in by then and we will have to update our forecasts. 
Monetary policy 
Monetary policy is expansionary 
Since  the  financial  crisis  worsened  last  autumn,  monetary  policy  has  been  aimed  at 
moderating the depth of the economic recession following in the wake of the crisis. The repo 
rate was cut from 4.75 per cent in September 2008 to an all-time low of 0.25 per cent in July 
2009.  The  Riksbank  has  also  supplied  the  banks  with  liquidity  to  counteract  the  negative 
effects  of  the  financial  crisis.  In  this  section  I  shall  discuss  in  slightly  greater  detail  our 
reasoning at the most recent monetary policy meeting, and the risks I see of developments 
being better or worse than we forecast. 
In July we cut the repo rate from 0.50 to 0.25 per cent. The economic recession appeared 
likely  to  be  deeper  than  the  Riksbank  had  earlier  forecast  and  we  were  expecting  GDP 
growth  to  be  slow  over  the  coming  years.  Resource  utilisation  would  therefore  remain  low 
throughout the entire forecast period. At the same time, the forecasts for underlying inflation 
were close to the inflation target of 2 per cent. We therefore considered that the repo rate 
probably needed to remain at this low level until autumn 2010 (see Figure 22).  
We also decided to grant loans to the banks of SEK 100 billion, with a twelve-month maturity 
and  at  a  fixed  interest  rate.  We  have  been  lending  money  to  the  banks  since  the  crisis 
worsened  in  September  2008  to  ensure  they  can  manage  their  liquidity.  For  instance,  we 
have  granted  loans  with  a  one-year  maturity  at  a  variable  interest  rate.  The  purpose  of 
granting loans with a one-year maturity at a low and fixed interest rate was to bring down the 
rates  in  the  interbank  market  and  thus  contribute  to  lower  interest  rates  on  loans  to 
companies and households. It was a means of increasing the scope for monetary policy to 
have the intended effect. 
Reasons for optimism 
Although the situation is still serious and requires extraordinary measures, there is beginning 
to be some cause for optimism. It is now the first time since September last year that our 
forecasts  and  those  of  other  analysts  no  longer  need  to  be  substantially  revised  down 
between  the  forecasting  rounds.  After  having  revised  down  the  forecasts  heavily  in  four 
6 
 BIS Review 98/2009
reports in a row since September, we made only a small downward revision in July and the 
most recent information points more to a slightly stronger picture of the real economy than 
the one we painted then. The IMF has even made an upward revision to the forecasts for the 
world economy in its July report.  
My assessment in July was that the risk outlook for economic developments in Sweden is 
now  balanced  for  the  first  time  since  spring  2008.  There  is  an  equally  great  risk  that 
developments will be better than forecast as that developments will be worse than forecast. 
Previously I have mainly seen risks of poorer developments than in our main scenario. 
Downside risks primarily include two factors that could indicate a poorer development in the 
real economy. One is that the economic recovery abroad could take time, which would have 
negative  effects  on  Swedish  exports.  The  other  is  that  the  situation  in  the  Baltic  countries 
could  deteriorate  and  cause  larger  loan  losses  for  the  Swedish  banks  than  we  have 
anticipated. This could indirectly dampen the recovery in the Swedish economy. 
Upside  risks  include  the  expansionary  fiscal  and  monetary  policy  measures  taken  in  most 
countries  and  which  may  lead  to  the  international  recovery  taking  place  sooner  than 
anticipated.  This  could  also  hasten  the  Swedish  recovery  by  means  of  an  increase  in 
exports. The new information received during the summer also indicates a slightly stronger 
development in economic activity than we had assumed. 
One could interpret the recent signs of increased optimism to mean that the need to increase 
the  repo  rate  will  approach  sooner.  However,  one  should  take  into  account  the  fact  that 
resource utilisation is very low and will remain so during the forecast period (see Figure 23) 
and that our monetary policy task primarily concerns ensuring that inflation remains close to 
the  target.  At  present  it  is  difficult  to  see  any  indications  that  inflationary  pressures  are 
increasing.  Rather  the  reverse;  the  weak  labour  market  and  the  unusually  low  resource 
utilisation point to low wage increases. This, combined with the fact that productivity usually 
improves when economic activity turns around, implies that unit labour costs will be weak in 
the coming period. We are also assuming that the krona will strengthen, which will hold back 
import prices. It is also difficult to believe that demand would become so strong that it pushes 
up inflation. 
It is considerations like this that are behind the assessment that I made in July; that the repo 
rate will probably need to remain at a low level for a long time to come. Resource utilisation 
will  remain  low  during  the  foreseeable  future  and  it  is  difficult  to  envisage  any  inflationary 
pressures.  At  the  same  time,  borrowers  should  be  aware  that  the  current  situation  is  an 
extreme one and that at some point in the future we will need to raise the interest rate back 
to a more normal level. 
Concluding remarks 
I have now described the Riksbank’s view and my personal view of developments in Sweden 
and  abroad.  Despite  GDP  falling  heavily  this  year,  employment  falling  and  unemployment 
rising, there are now signs that an improvement is on the way. The situation in the financial 
markets  has  improved  and  the  new  information  received  during  the  summer  confirms  the 
view that the deep recession has bottomed out. But the improvement is from unusually low 
levels  and  the  recovery  will  probably  be  weak.  Inflation  will  be  negative  this  year,  but 
underlying inflation will be close to the inflation target of 2 per cent. Monetary policy is aimed 
at dampening the economic downturn. The repo rate was cut to an all-time low of 0.25 per 
cent in July and is expected to remain at this low level for the coming year. 
Thank you for your attention!
