José De Gregorio: Monetary policy and pass-through to interest rates 
Speech  by  Mr  José  De  Gregorio,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  before  the 
Honorable  Chamber  of  Representative’s  Economic,  Promotion  and  Development 
Commission, Santiago, 16 March 2009. 
The Spanish original prevails. 
 Mr.  President.  I  wish  to  thank  you  and  the  Economic,  Promotion  and  Development 
Commission  of  the  Honorable  Chamber  of  Representatives  for  inviting  me  to  speak  about 
how our monetary policy decisions affect the country’s financial and lending conditions. 
The  global  economy  is  enduring  terribly  uncertain  times,  which  have  implications  on  our 
country’s  prospects  for  growth  and  inflation.  Thus,  we  share  your  preoccupation  for 
evaluating how monetary policy actions – one of the main stabilizing tools we have available 
as a country – ultimately affect the cost of borrowing faced by households and firms. 
Monetary policy, in the context of an inflation target and a floating exchange rate like the one 
operating  in  Chile  since  1999,  is  an  important  mechanism  for  smoothing  out  the  business 
cycle.  Periods  of  weak  output  and  demand  performance,  which  reduce  the  medium-term 
inflation outlook, lend themselves to countercyclical monetary policy actions that cushion the 
negative effects on consumption, investment and employment. This is what the Central Bank 
of Chile is presently doing, acting resolutely to moderate the effects that the global crisis – 
the worst we have seen in decades – is having in Chile. 
The transmission of monetary policy 
The Central Bank of Chile’s monetary policy operates largely through its effects on the cost 
of  lending,  as  it  influences  the  cost  of  bank  financing.  The  Bank’s  main  instrument  is  the 
monetary  policy  interest  rate,  or  MPR.  It  is  worth  noting  that  the  level  which  the  Board 
chooses every month for the MPR represents an objective for the cost of overnight lending 
between banks. In other words, the Central Bank operates in the interbank market, seeing 
that  the  interest  rate  at  which  banks  lend  to  and  borrow  from  each  other  overnight 
approaches the MPR. Therefore, it is important to understand how this interest rate, which 
operates in a very specific and well defined market (among banks and for a term of one day 
only), affects the spending and investing decisions made by households and firms even over 
several years.  
The explanation for this phenomenon is that, in normal circumstances, what matters is not 
only  today’s  level  of  the  MPR,  but  the  whole  future  path  expected  by  the  market  for  such 
interest rate. This is what ultimately affects the entire yield structure. In other words, for a 
five-year loan, for instance, it is more important for the potential borrower to have an idea of 
how the MPR will be behaving in the next five years that to know its current level.  
The above has first-order implications on the conduct, implementation and communication of 
monetary policy. In fact, while obviously important, the decisions that we adopt as the Central 
Bank  Board  at  the  monetary  policy  meetings  are  not  the  only  element  shaping  the  credit 
conditions  within  the  economy.  Also  of  first  order  is  the  market’s  perception  of  how  the 
monetary policy will be managed in future months and years. This leads us to be extremely 
cautious in our communication, in order for the decisions we make to be perceived with the 
adequate persistence.  
The monetary policy that the Board has been implementing in the past few months clearly 
illustrates this phenomenon. Despite the fact that the MPR was held constant at 8.25% in the 
last months of the past year, thanks to the way we communicate our decisions and to the 
BIS Review 35/2009

incorporation  of  an  explicit  bias  the  MPR  level  expected  by  the  market  six  months  ahead 
dropped significantly, pulling down the deposit rate at longer terms. Subsequent reductions 
to  the  MPR  that  have  been  applied  this  year  have  gone  beyond  market  expectations, 
reducing financing costs (figure 1). 
To succeed in communicating properly, transparently and credibly is then key for monetary 
policy  decisions  to  cause  the  impact  that  is  needed.  This  is  what  makes  monetary  policy 
effective,  and  it  is  why  the  Central  Bank  has  maintained  a  systematic  policy  of 
communication and transparency, through the presentations we  make as Board members, 
with our Monetary Policy Reports, and with the transparency mechanisms we have for our 
policy  decisions.  In  the  latter  area  we  actually  have  made  major  innovations  since  our 
Monetary  Policy  Meeting  last  Thursday.  We  now  upload  to  our  public  website  the 
background information based on publicly available data before holding the meetings where 
we decide on monetary policy.  
Today’s scenario: uncertainty and risks 
Monetary policy is one of many factors influencing the cost of borrowing faced by households 
and firms. Another factor that has gained significant importance is the perception of risk and 
volatility that has swept over every financial market. This increased with the worsening of the 
global  financial  crisis  last  September.  In  general,  and  despite  efforts  made  by  economic 
policy makers in the main economies around the world, we are still dwelling in an extremely 
uncertain scenario. This has a number of implications that ultimately affect the conditions and 
costs of credit to firms and households not only in Chile but everywhere.  
To begin with, external lending standards for domestic banks have become more stringent. 
We see it in that, although our banks have been able to access foreign credit sources, these 
have  been  at  shorter  maturities  and  with  larger  spreads  over  external  reference  interest 
rates.  This is  a  reflection  of  the  difficulties  that continue  to haunt  the  main  global  financial 
institutions  and  their  reluctance  to  embark  in  new  businesses.  This  has  not  altered  the 
liquidity available in the local money market, which has remained stable, aside from some 
transitory turbulence in early October that was addressed by the Central Bank through the 
implementation of new modalities in the provision of liquidity. 
Secondly, the meltdown of world output and trade is increasing credit risk globally. In turn, 
firms  and  households  with  a  better  financial  situation  tend  naturally  to  postpone  their 
spending and borrowing decisions, awaiting the normalization of the financial environment, 
thus shrinking the demand for credit. All of this results in increased average financing cost 
and tougher lending standards for those agents actually engaging in borrowing operations. 
We  can see  that  the  various  risk  and  volatility indicators  are  substantially  above  their  pre-
September figures (figure 2). As we wrote in our latest Monetary Policy Report,1 the extra 
financial  burden  for  the  clients  of  Chilean  banks  has  tended  to  reflect  precisely  the  higher 
levels of global uncertainty and their impact on the Chilean economy. 
I  must  stress  that  these  phenomena  are  occurring  today  in  every  economy  in  the  world, 
sometimes with catastrophic implications on their levels of output and the solvency of their 
financial institutions. Because we prepared as a country for a long while to confront severe 
deteriorations of the international economic environment, Chile and our financial market have 
suffered limited effects, with no sudden stops but, on the contrary, with increases in credit 
supply  and  without  a  generalized  process  of  insolvency.  These  same  precautions  have 
permitted macroeconomic policies – both fiscal and monetary – to be clearly countercyclical, 
helping to cushion the effects of the world crisis on our economy.

The transmission of MPR reductions to lending interest rates 
One important element in the diagnosis of how this countercyclical effort is actually working 
is the evaluation we perform on a permanent basis to the way our decisions are affecting the 
borrowing conditions facing households and firms. This issue is not new, and was the subject 
of analysis several years back when the Central Bank’s monetary policy was on a sustained 
expansionary path.2 The evidence we gathered then can be summed up in that the Central 
Bank’s monetary policy decisions are reflected in the banks’ financial cost very quickly, but in 
the overall cost of credit only after a few months. This response pattern was similar to that in 
other economies. Lately, we have reviewed that information,3 and we have found that, even 
in moments of great uncertainty as we experienced in recent months, reductions to the MPR 
are translating into reduced borrowing costs for both businesses and consumers.  
One good example is the trend of the interest rate on commercial loans at 30 to 89 days, 
which can be linked to the funding of working capital. This rate was very high in October last 
year, but this year so far it has fallen substantially. We estimate that if we had not cut the 
MPR by a combined 350 basis points (bp) between January and February, this rate would be 
some  250  bp  above  where  it  is  today.  A  similar  situation  can  be  seen  in  the  case  of 
consumer loans. The cost of mortgage financing, meanwhile, has been less sensitive to the 
changes in the MPR precisely because those are long-term borrowing decisions. However, 
without the drop in long-term rates – which has partly originated in the monetary easing – 
mortgage rates would have stayed largely above their current levels (figure 3). We estimate, 
then, that the monetary policy decisions recently adopted have begun to pass through to the 
credit conditions faced by households and firms. This pass-through should continue in the 
near future, especially after the reduction in the MPR that the Board determined last week. 
We  will  keep  monitoring  these  effects  permanently,  because  for  us  it  is  essential  that  the 
MPR propagates to market rates smoothly. We certainly expect the latest MPR reduction last 
Thursday to result in additional decreases in the banking system’s lending rates. 
This  type  of  exercises  also  permits  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  the  higher  degrees  of 
uncertainty,  volatility  and  risk  we  have  been  observing  since  last  September.  If  we  do  the 
exercise  of  asking  ourselves  where  would  the  lending  rate  be  in  a  hypothetical  scenario 
without the global financial crisis, we find that it would be between 50 bp and 350 bp below 
its  present  level,  with  the  larger  effect  on  the  interest  rates  on  commercial  and  consumer 
loans.  In  the  specific  case  of  mortgage  loans,  the  increase  in  the  interest  rate  occurred 
between  September  and  December  2008  can  be  largely  linked  to  the  implications  of  the 
external  conditions  on  the  local  perception  of  risk  (figure  4).  All  the  above  is  a  clear 
illustration of how the severe uncertainty and high risks that were unleashed last September 
are affecting the domestic economy.  
Non-bank financing sources 
Notwithstanding  the  key  role  played  by  domestic  banks  in  funding  households  and  firms, 
especially  smaller  ones,  for  the  bigger  companies  there  are  other  equally  important  credit 
sources. Thus, around 45% of total corporate borrowing is non-bank, with external debt and 
domestic bonds at the top of the list. Therefore, it is important to understand the behavior of 
the interest rates on these credits before offering a global outlook of financial conditions. 
The Central Bank of Chile has no direct effect on external financial conditions. Like banks, 
Chilean firms have seen their borrowing conditions tighten under the changed state of affairs. 
Still, our banks and firms continue to enjoy normal access to world financial markets, owing

to a great extent to our policy framework that ensures the solvency of our economy and to 
our sound financial system.  
As  for  the  local  bonds  market,  January  stood  out  for  its  large  corporate  bond  issuances. 
Meanwhile, the interest rate demanded from corporate bonds in the secondary market has 
been falling through all of this year, and is currently approaching its levels of last September. 
This drop owes exclusively to the decline in the interest rates on Central Bank documents, 
because  the  spread  between  public  and  corporate  securities  has  increased  significantly 
since September, reflecting the same global risk factors already mentioned (figure 5).  
Conclusions 
The global financial crisis has hit hard credit markets around the world. In some unfortunate 
cases,  economies  that  faced  this  debacle  from  a  fragile  initial  position,  with  high 
indebtedness or with fast credit growth, have faced drastic adjustments in local asset prices, 
output, and employment, with dire consequences on their living standards. Thanks to the fact 
that  we  prepared  for  years  as  a  country  to  confront  deteriorations  of  the  external 
environment, our monetary policy has been able to adopt a clear countercyclical stance to 
lessen the effect on our economy of the global financial meltdown.  
We have seen that the aggressive reductions in the MPR implemented by the Board since 
January have begun to reflect on the borrowing conditions faced by households and firms. It 
is reasonable to expect this to continue in the coming weeks, especially after the MPR cut of 
last  week.  However,  a  full  normalization  of  credit  demand  and  supply  will  depend  on  the 
appeasing of the global financial environment, on more clarity about the definitive structure of 
the  global  financial  system,  and  on  economic growth  prospects  settling  down  in  the  larger 
economies of the world. 
Overall,  it  is  important  to  note  that  this  analysis  has  focused  on  the  cost  of  credit  for 
operations  already  materialized.  The  other  central  dimension  of  the  financial  system 
operation is clients’ access to credit. Lately loans have slowed down. It is difficult to figure out 
how  much  of  this  to  blame  on  lower  demand  and  how  much  on  the  financial  institutions’ 
reluctance to lend. In any case, we believe it is important that financial institutions, provided 
good  risk  management,  continue  to  lend  to  firms  and  households.  We  agree  with  the 
Superintendent  of  Banks  and  share  the  principle  that  through  tough  times  the  banks  must 
stand by their clients and cooperate in the solution of their financial problems.  
I would like to inform you that, as part of our process of increasing transparency, particularly 
regarding  public  dissemination  of  information  about  interest  rates  charged  on  credit 
operations, we have decided to extend the available data on credit conditions by maturity, 
indexation,  and  type  of  loan.  Thus,  starting  today  our  website  has  increased  the  level  of 
detail of interest rate information made available to the public.4 Part of said information was 
used in producing the results reported in this presentation. 
Just  as  we  did  a  year  ago,  when  we  discussed  the  exchange  rate  conjuncture  at  the 
Honorable Chamber of Representatives, I want to state that we act with the conviction that 
we are making the best decisions to provide stability to our economy and widen its growth 
opportunities.  We  permanently  and  carefully  monitor  the  situation  and  we  incorporate  it 
consistently in our monetary policy decisions.  
To  finish,  I  thank  again  the  Economic,  Promotion  and  Development  Commission  of  the 
Honorable  Chamber  of  Representatives  and  its  President,  representative  Mr.  Antonio  Leal 
for letting me present our visions here. The serious management of monetary policy and its 
formulation on a solid technical basis is essential to ensure economic stability in such volatile

and blurred global conditions as we are now going through. I appreciate this opportunity to 
come  and  expose  our  vision  of  the  relationship  between  market  interest  rates  and  the 
conduct of our monetary policy. 
Thank you.
