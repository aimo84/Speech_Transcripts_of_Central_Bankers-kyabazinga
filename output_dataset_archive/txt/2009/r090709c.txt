L Wilson Kamit: Tackling extreme poverty in Papua New Guinea 
Address by Mr L Wilson Kamit, CBE, Governor of the Bank of Papua New Guinea, to the 
Lowy  Institute  for  International  Policy  Conference  on  “Tackling  Extreme  Poverty  in  Papua 
New Guinea”, Sydney, 14 May 2009. 
 Distinguished guests, 
Ladies and gentlemen 
May  I  firstly  thank  the  organizers  of  this  conference,  namely  the  Lowy  Institute  for 
International Policy, Care Australia and the Australian National University for the invitation to 
address this conference on tackling extreme poverty in PNG. 
It is not very often that Governors of central banks are asked to comment on social issues or 
microeconomic  matters.  We  tend  to  look  at  the  macroeconomic  level.  Given  the  global 
financial  crisis  and  its  adverse  effects  that  are  being  felt  right  across  the  globe,  I  am 
pleasantly  surprised  at  the  invitation  to  this  conference.  Recently,  I  have  been  asked  to 
address different audiences on this subject at home and abroad.  
I  was  asked  to  comment  on  the  impact  of  the  current  global  financial  crisis  on  the  PNG 
economy and its impact on poverty. I have some comments to make on the first part, which 
is the likely impact of the global financial crisis on PNG. I must however confess that there 
are others gathered here today who are better placed to comment on the second part of our 
discussions on the impact on poverty. I will therefore restrict myself to making some general 
remarks. 
Ladies  and  gentlemen,  much  has  been  said  and  written  about  the  causes  of  the  current 
global financial crisis and its effects around the globe. I will therefore not dwell on them.  
The maxim that “no nation is an island” is never more so true than now, where all countries, 
developed  and  developing,  if  they  have  not  been  so  far,  will  be  affected  in  one  way  or 
another  by  this  crisis.  Development  through  globalisation,  international  trade  and  global 
finance has meant that we, in PNG, will also be affected by activities and events taking place 
far  away  in  the  major  financial  centres  and  industrialized  countries.  As  a  small,  open 
economy, PNG is a price taker for our exports and is vulnerable to the global economic and 
financial conditions.  
Given this, the question for us, therefore, is in what ways is PNG likely to be affected by this 
financial crisis. 
We  are,  to  an  extent,  fortunate  in  PNG  in  that  our  banking  system  is  shielded  from  the 
immediate  effects  of  the  crisis.  Our  banks  and  financial  institutions  are  engaged  in  the 
traditional financial activities of raising funds from depositors and making loans to borrowers. 
Almost  all  the  funds  raised  by  our  commercial  banks  are  done  so  through  deposit  takings 
domestically. Deposits comprise over 80 percent of our commercial banks’ liabilities, much of 
it in kina. Foreign currency deposits are only a small component of the banks’ deposit base. 
As  at  the  end  of  December  2008,  foreign  currency  deposit  was  around  9  percent  of  total 
deposits.  
The commercial banks are generally sound with high capital adequacy ratios. In 2008, their 
capital adequacy ratio was 25 percent, higher than our limit of 12 percent (see chart 1). The 
banks  have  no  exposure  to  sophisticated  financial  products  such  as  mortgage-backed 
securities that are linked to the demise of the sub-prime mortgage market. The high level of 
liquidity in the banking system also provided sufficient funds for commercial banks to operate 
without resorting to borrowing from the international financial system.

Despite the high level of liquidity, the commercial banks’ lending is prudent with low levels of 
non-performing  loans.  In  2008,  non-performing  loans  totaled  K70  million,  down  from  K277 
million  in  2001  (see  chart  2).  Lending  also  comprises  a  small  share  of  the  banks’  assets, 
about 35 percent. The banks are well managed and closely regulated by the Bank of PNG. In 
addition, the two subsidiaries of Australian banks have in place guarantees from their parent 
banks (letters of comfort) for any lending in excess of prudential exposure limits set by the 
Bank  of  PNG,  giving  confidence  to  the  stability  of  the  financial  system.  Both  these  banks’ 
parents have double “A” credit ratings by Standard and Poor’s.  
However, the financial institutions and companies most likely to be affected by the crisis are 
the  superannuation  funds  and  PNG  dual-listed  companies  in  overseas  stock  markets.  The 
two major superannuation funds, the Nambawan Super Ltd and Nasfund Ltd, have some of 
their  assets  invested  in  offshore  equities,  while  the  rest  are  invested  in  commodity-based 
stocks  that  are  dual-listed  in  PNG  and  overseas  markets.  They  have  reported  positive 
returns  in  2008  and  remain  positive  and  confident,  though  with  lower  returns  projected  for 
2009. 
Indeed,  much  credit  must  be  given  to  the  financial  sector  reforms  introduced  by  the 
Government in 2000, which created an independent central bank and introduced improved 
supervision  of  the  financial  system.  The  reforms  saw  much  needed  changes  done  to 
strengthening our financial sector after the excesses and mismanagement of the 1990s (see 
chart 3). The reforms also meant we were in a better position to face the current financial 
crisis.  
While PNG may not be directly affected by the global financial crisis, we will be if and when 
the  financial  crisis  turns  into  a  recession.  Already,  the  major  industrialized  countries  are 
experiencing negative growth in economic activity. These countries include the United States 
(US), United Kingdom (UK), Germany, and Japan. There is lower growth here in Australia. 
Besides China, these are the major markets for many of our exports. A slowdown in these 
countries  would  mean  less  demand  for  our  export  commodities,  resulting  in  lower  export 
revenue,  and  a  reduction  in  Government  tax  revenue.  A  lower  reserve  level  means  less 
funds available for the Central Bank to invest in and loss of income to the Government (see 
chart 10).  
In the private sector, lower export demand would mean companies would hold back on any 
expansion  plans,  save  costs  by  reducing  employment  and  may  have  difficulties  servicing 
their loans. Furthermore, foreign investors would delay any new investments in the country 
given the uncertainties. Generally speaking, economic activity in the country would be lower 
(see chart 4). For 2009, the Government forecasted a growth in economic activity (GDP) of 6 
percent.  
All this does not augur well for poverty reduction in PNG. Less Government revenue would 
mean the Government has to reduce its expenditure (see chart 5). This is the prudent fiscal 
response  to  a  reduction  in  revenue.  The  alternative  would  be  to  borrow,  domestically  or 
externally,  to  make  up  for  the  revenue  shortfall.  This  would  however  mean  increasing  the 
Government’s  indebtedness.  So  far,  the  Government  has  succeeded  in  reducing  its  debt. 
The Government’s debt to GDP ratio declined from 71 percent in 2001 to around 30 percent 
in  2008  (see  chart  6).  A  return  to  borrowing  (deficit  financing)  would  reverse  this 
achievement, as well as passing on the burden of servicing the debt to future generations of 
Papua New Guineans. Tying down financial resources for debt servicing means there is less 
money available to fund the provision of much-needed goods and services to the populace.  
If the Government decides to reduce expenditure, this may mean cutting back on essential 
social  services  of  health  and  education,  and  important  infrastructure  projects  that  would 
improve the livelihood of our people. The Government has set aside the windfall gains from 
high  commodity  prices  in  2007  and  the  first  half  of  2008  in  various  trust  accounts  for 
spending in the key priority areas of infrastructure, health, education, agriculture and law and 
order. However, with revenue forecasted to be lower than expected, this would put pressure

on  the  Government  to  access  these  funds  to  maintain  recurrent  expenditure  levels.  This 
concern was raised at the recent PNG Economic Update forum series in Port Moresby. 
The majority of our people still live in their villages, relying on subsistence farming and fishing 
and  using  the  cash  economy  whenever  the  need  arises.  They  also  benefit  from  their 
extended  family  ties  through  the  “wantok”  (care  for  extended  family)  system.  Fortunately, 
they are least affected by the workings of the Government and its agencies, much less by the 
global financial crisis. 
Our own challenges in the Central Bank in relation to poverty alleviation involve the issues of 
financial  inclusions  and  financial  literacy.  How  do  we  get  the  vast  majority  of  our  people 
outside  our  financial  system  to  participate  fully  within  the  system  and  benefit  from  the 
economic  growth?  Over  the  years,  we  have  revitalized  the  savings  and  loan  society 
movement,  closing  down  dormant  societies,  improving  on  training  for  their  staff  and 
increasing supervision on their activities. We have also licensed two microfinance institutions 
to  complement  the  activities  of  the  commercial  banks  and  other  financial  institutions.  The 
savings and loan societies and microfinance companies are aimed at assisting low income 
earners  and  entrepreneurs  to  do  businesses,  improve  their  lifestyles  and  should  assist  in 
alleviating  poverty.  How  can  we  ensure  our  people  are  financially  literate  so  that they  can 
make informed financial decisions as well as notice unscrupulous deals when they see one? 
Financial education and literacy programmes by the Government sector, private sector and 
non-government organizations are important. Financial literacy programmes lead to financial 
inclusion  which  improves  the  lifestyles  or  economic  conditions  of  those  engaged  in  it  and 
help reduce poverty. However, to work effectively, both these two activities would have to be 
undertaken together, that is, microfinance development together with financial literacy. The 
on-going financial global crisis shows the importance of dealing with these issues, even in 
the industrialized countries.  
The  current  global  financial  crisis  is  a  concern.  Some  say  it  is  the  worse  economic  crisis 
since the Great Depression of the 1930s. If so, it presents a challenge to all of us here today. 
To  those  of  us  involved  in  the  economic  management  of  the  country,  as  well  as  the 
technocrats, the politicians, the business community and civil society. We all have a part to 
play in ensuring that any adverse impact of the crisis is eliminated or minimize, especially on 
the most vulnerable members of our community. 
In  the  1990s,  what  some  call  the  “lost  decade”,  when  in  spite  of  high  earnings  from  our 
mineral wealth and steady economic growth, gross fiscal mismanagement, the closure of a 
major mining project and other external factors, we were deprived of the opportunity to set 
the  stage  for  progress and  growth.  We  hope  we  have  learnt  from  this  experience  and  not 
repeat the same mistakes.  
Thank  you  again  for  the  invitation  and  I  look  forward  to  the  rest  of  the  discussions  at  this 
important and timely conference. 
Thank you.
