Nicholas C Garganas: Macroeconomic management in an environment of 
aggregate supply shocks – lessons from recent experience 
Background  paper  to  speech  by  Mr  Nicholas  C  Garganas,  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Greece,  at  the 
SEANZA Symposium, Bank Negara Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, 25 November 2006. 
 The issue that this background paper addresses concerns macroeconomic management in the face of 
supply side shocks. While the main focus is on monetary policy reactions the paper will also touch 
briefly on the possible roles of other policy responses, as well as issues related to the policy mix. 
Supply-side  shocks  have  played  an  important  role  in  shaping  the  economic  history  of  the  global 
economy  over  the  last  40  years  or  so.  The  most  common  supply-side  shock,  familiar  to  both 
economists  and  non-economists  alike,  has  been  that  associated  with  variations  in  the  price  of  oil. 
However,  other  examples  include  shocks  to  total  factor  productivity,  arising  from  innovation  and/or 
technical progress. A recent example of this type of shock is the technology boom of the late 1990s in 
the US, leading to the creation of the so-called ‘new economy’. 
Some theoretical considerations 
Supply-side shocks affect production and, therefore, both potential and actual outputs. Consider, first, 
the  effect  on  potential  output.  A  negative  supply  shock  (eg  an  increase  in  the  price  of  oil  or  a 
slowdown in productivity) reduces the potential output of an economy for given levels of inputs and the 
price level. Alternatively, it increases prices for a given level of output. As production costs rise, profit 
margins are squeezed and, in an attempt to maintain mark-ups, firms raise their prices. For a given 
level of demand, therefore, the negative supply shock leads to a fall in output and there will be upward 
pressure on the price level. 
If the upward pressure on the price level is not accommodated by the monetary authority, it will lead to 
negative  demand  effects,  causing  actual  output  to  fall.  Moreover,  supply-side  shocks  may  induce 
additional demand effects if, as is likely, consumers and investors are forward looking. These demand 
effects will  be  larger  the more  permanent  the  shock  is  deemed to  be.  A  permanent  fall  in  potential 
output is likely to generate pessimistic expectations of future income and wealth, causing consumers 
to  cut  back  on  expenditures.  The  decline  in  the  real  rate  of  return  on  investment  will  lead  firms  to 
invest less. This effect might be particularly strong in the case of a negative supply shock that arises 
from  a  slowdown  in  the  rate  of  technological  progress.  Additionally,  firms  may  feel  the  effect  of 
increased  financial  constraints  as  falling  profits  reduce  the  amount  of  funds  that  can  be  generated 
internally. 
Thus, negative supply-side shocks can cause declines in both potential output and actual output. That 
growth will slow or, perhaps, turn negative, other things being equal, is not in doubt. What is less clear 
is what the ultimate effect will be on the price level (or, more generally, inflation). Initially the difference 
between  actual  output  and  potential  output,  the  output  gap,  is  likely  to  be  positive,  generating 
inflationary pressures. However, once the demand effects begin to bite, the output gap will narrow and 
inflationary pressures subside. 
At this point, it is perhaps worth noting that the impact on prices or inflation may differ depending on 
the source of the negative supply shock. In the case of an oil price shock, the impact on inflation is 
likely to be greater than other shocks. Aside from being an important input to the production process, 
oil is also a consumption good and hence its price feeds directly into consumer prices. Prices may 
also  increase  to  the  extent  that  workers  resist  the  erosion  of  their  real  wages  by  seeking  higher 
nominal  wages  that  must  be  reflected  in  the  prices  of  goods  and  services  they  produce.  This 
behaviour  generates  a  second  round  of  price  increases,  resulting  possibly  in  a  wage-price  spiral. 
Wage-price spirals are a special concern to policy makers since they are likely to amplify the initial 
impact  of  an  oil  (or  any  other)  price  increase.  The  timing  of  such  second  round  effects  depends 
crucially on such factors as the average duration of the wage contract and the inclusion of “escalator

clauses”  in  contracts.  Evidence  from  the  US  and  Europe  suggests  that  this  time  lag  is  around  one 
year1 in those currency areas. 
The  above analysis  leads  to  the conclusion  that  policy  makers  face  a  particularly  difficult challenge 
when  dealing  with  supply-side  shocks,  unlike  demand  shocks,  which  influence  both  growth  and 
inflation in the same direction, thereby simplifying somewhat the policy response. A negative supply 
shock tends to reduce growth (perhaps even causing it to become negative), while increasing inflation. 
Thus monetary policy faces a trade-off; if the authorities seek to maintain real economic activity, they 
will risk setting off an inflationary spiral. 
An important consideration when deciding on the policy response is whether the shock is expected to 
be  permanent  or  temporary.  A  temporary  shock  is  unlikely  to  warrant  a  policy  response  provided 
consumers, investors and policy makers recognise that the shock will be short-lived. In the case of a 
temporary  shock,  an  imminent  recovery  will  be  expected  so  that  the  additional  demand  effects  are 
unlikely  to  materialise;  at  the  same  time  any  fall  in  potential  output  will  be  temporary.  In  these 
circumstances, a response from monetary policy would be inappropriate. The impact of the shock may 
well have dissipated by the time that the impact of the monetary policy actions is felt. In other words, 
the long lags associated with monetary policy make it unsuited for fine-tuning the economy to smooth 
the effect of temporary shocks. 
By  contrast,  a  permanent  supply-side  shock  will  lead,  at  least  in  the  short  run  under  conditions  of 
inflexible wages and prices, to the challenge identified above – that is, dealing with lower growth and, 
most likely, higher inflation. The response of the monetary authorities will depend on their goals. One 
possible  policy  framework,  although  not  the  one  followed by  the ECB,  is  a Taylor  rule  under which 
specific weights are assigned to both inflation and growth in formulating monetary policy. One could 
imagine a situation whereby the interest rate remains essentially unchanged in the short run – the rise 
in the rate necessitated by the increase in inflation being exactly offset by the reduction necessitated 
by  the  fall  in  growth.  In  practice,  however,  it  is  more  likely  that  the  interest  rate  will  rise,  given  the 
emphasis most central banks place on price stability in the medium term. A rise in the policy rate also 
has  the  advantage  that  it  might  keep  the  lid  on  possible  second  round  effects  if  the  source  of  the 
shock is an oil price rise. What is crucial here is the focus on price stability in the face of shocks. By 
maintaining price stability, central banks can help ensure that actual output returns to its potential level 
without the distorting price signals provided by rising inflation. 
In the long run, though, a permanent negative supply shock will lead to a reduction in the equilibrium 
interest rate. In such a situation, monetary policy will concentrate on the need to bring the market rate 
back into line with the equilibrium rate. 
Implicit  in  the  preceding  argument  is  that  the  policy  maker  can  clearly  identify  both  the  nature  of 
shocks  and  their  impact.  In  practice,  however,  things  are  not  nearly  so  clear-cut.  The  problems 
associated with measuring potential output, and hence the output gap, are well known and so there is 
no need to repeat them here. An additional problem is that, even if we have what we consider to be a 
satisfactory way of measuring potential output, estimates of potential output in real time usually differ 
from those calculated with historical hindsight (Figure 1)2. If it is difficult to measure potential output in 
general,  it  is  even  more  of  a  challenge  to  measure  it  accurately  at  the  time  when  the  monetary 
authorities need to make a decision. Moreover, aside from the problems of measuring potential output, 
there  is  also  the  question  of  whether  it  is  possible  to  determine  whether  shocks  are  temporary  or 
permanent. Clearly, the more quickly a permanent shock can be distinguished from a temporary one, 
the  more quickly  it  can  be  determined  what,  if  any,  the  policy  response  should  be.  In  practice,  this 
implies a continuous assessment by the monetary authorities of developments on the supply side and, 
given  that  an  assessment  at  any  particular  point  in  time  is  likely  to  be  surrounded  by  considerable 
uncertainty, the monetary policy response is likely to be gradual. 
                                                      
1   Taylor (1999) provides direct evidence for the US; evidence for Europe is indirect, but suggests that the duration of wage 
contracts is around one year as, in the US (see Smets and Wouters, 2002). 
2   The literature suggests that policy recommendations using real time data may differ substantially from those based on ex 
post revised data (see, for example, Orphanides and van Norden, 2002 and Gerdesmeier and Roffia, 2004). For instance, 
the  inflation  pressures  in  the  US  that  accompanied  the  1970s  oil  price  shocks  can  partly  be  attributed  to  the  monetary 
authorities’ misperception of the output gap (on the basis of real time data, potential output was overestimated) and this led 
to an easier monetary policy than might otherwise have been followed (see Hunt, 2005).

 BIS Review 119/2006
Experience in the euro area and the US with supply-side shocks 
The discussion until this point has largely been in an analytical context. One of the basic messages to 
emerge from the analysis is the fact that theory does not give us a clear lead – there are too many ‘ifs’ 
and ‘buts’. For this reason, it is useful to examine the recent experience with supply-side shocks and 
to draw some lessons from this experience. 
As Figure 2 shows, the oil price has climbed sharply in the last few years, from under $30 a barrel in 
2003 to its high of over $70 a barrel in early August of this year. The factors contributing to this sharp 
increase stem from both the demand-side and the supply-side. On the demand side, there has been 
the rapid increase in the energy needs of emerging market economies, especially China and India; on 
the supply side, there has been low spare capacity throughout the production chain in an environment 
of  geopolitical  tensions.  Even  allowing  that  the  price  of  oil  has  recently  fallen  back  to  below  $60  a 
barrel, the rise in the price of oil from under $30 a barrel represents a very significant oil price shock. It 
has come at a time when both the US economy and that of the euro area have been experiencing 
diverging  productivity  developments.  Since  the  mid-1990s,  the  US  has  experienced  a  positive 
productivity shock with the long-term trend in productivity having picked up significantly following two-
and-a-half decades of downwardly trending productivity. By contrast, in the euro area, the downward 
trend that began in the 1970s has continued (Figure 3)3. 
The responses of both the US and the euro area, in terms of inflation and output, to the oil price shock 
have, until now, been subdued. The US economy has continued to expand at a robust pace. While 
growth  in  the  third  quarter  of  this  year  was  considerably  below  expectations,  this  outcome  was 
primarily a reflection of the slowdown in housing; whilst inflation rose to around 4% this summer, it has 
subsequently subsided with the Fed’s recent cycle of monetary tightening inter alia having contributed 
to this outcome. In the euro area, the recovery, while slow in getting under way, is now broadening 
and  deepening.  Output  this  year  is  growing  at  close  to,  if  not  above,  potential.  Moreover,  inflation, 
while higher than the “close to but below 2%” definition of price stability set by the ECB, is much below 
the levels experienced after the first two oil price shocks. These outcomes appear to be more modest 
than the predictions of econometric models, estimated on the basis of past relationships when oil-price 
shocks exerted a relatively large impact on inflation and growth. For example, euro area econometric 
models  predict  that  a  50%  increase  in  oil  prices,  ceteris  paribus,  would  add  almost  0.7  percentage 
point  on  average  to  CPI  inflation  in  the  first  year,  while  reducing  GDP  growth  by  around  0.4 
percentage  point  (Table  1)4.  We  have  not,  however,  seen  such  large  effects  this  time  around. 
Consequently,  other  factors  appear  to  have  worked  to  explain  the  actual  outcomes  following  this 
particular shock. This argument can be elaborated on. 
In  the  US,  the  negative  supply  shock  of  the  rise  in  oil  prices  has  occurred  at  a  time  that  the  trend 
growth  rate  in  productivity  has  been  rising,  a  positive  supply  shock.  Increased  labour  productivity 
during the 1990s came from capital deepening; after the burst of the technology bubble at the turn of 
the millennium, total factor productivity took over as the main engine of labour productivity growth5. In 
addition, it has been argued that Alan Greenspan, having recognised the productivity shock early on 
(and  certainly  earlier  than  many  others,  including  wage  earners  so  that  wage  pressures  remained 
low), was able to exploit the benefits of the shock in terms of lower inflation and higher output growth 
by not raising policy rates to the new, higher equilibrium rate implied by the shock in the long run6. It 
has also been pointed out that deregulation of energy markets in the US has made the economy more 
resilient  to  oil  price  shocks  since  price  increases  no  longer  have  the  same  negative  effect  on 
productivity that they did in the past7.

Herrera (Hamilton and Herrera, 2004; Bernanke et al, 2004), Carlstrom and Fuentes (2005) and Jones et al (2004). The 
Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  San  Francisco  (2005)  refers  to  evidence  that  suggests  that,  following  a  50%  rise  in  oil  prices, 
output in the US two years hence will have fallen some 0.4 percentage point below steady state and inflation will have risen 
by 0.2 percentage point.

US were still controlled. Hence, following the first oil price shock energy was rationed and it was not necessarily the case 
that  the  most  productive  units  were  those  that  got  access  to  the  energy  available.  Thus  oil  price  shocks led  to  negative 
effects on productivity.

However,  the  US  experience  does  not  get  us  very  far  in  understanding  that  of  the  euro  area.  The 
continued decline in trend labour productivity growth, induced by both a reduction in capital deepening 
and total factor productivity8, implies that the euro area was already experiencing a negative supply-
side  shock  when  the  oil  price  rise  occurred.  This  situation  suggests  that  there  are  factors  at  work, 
perhaps in both the US and euro-area economies, which have helped dampen the impact of this latest 
negative supply side shock. These factors include the following. 
First, there is a group of factors that might come under the general heading of structural changes in 
industrial  economies.  Some  analysts  point  out  that  industrial  economies  are  less  dependent  on  oil 
today than they were during the 1970s (see Figures 4-6). Output is now much less energy-intensive 
compared  to  previous  decades  and  other  sources  of  energy  have  reduced  industrial  countries’ 
dependence on oil9. However, this cannot be all of the story since if the effect of an oil price rise is 
proportional to the amount of energy used in production, then, other things being equal, we would still 
have expected to see a sharp slowdown in economic growth as a consequence of the recent sharp 
rise in prices10. Yet, there has been no such slowing in growth. 
A second structural change is the increase in globalisation, which has significantly raised competitive 
pressures  in  industrialised  countries11.  Aside  from  generating  a  dampening  effect  on  prices  in 
industrialised countries through reduced import prices (a positive supply shock), globalisation has also 
weakened the power of trade unions. This situation appears to have contributed to subdued second 
round  effects,  helping  industrial  countries  avoid  wage-price  spirals.  Employers  now  resist  wage 
increases in the face of high energy prices in order that their mark-ups are not squeezed. Moreover, 
international competition has reduced the pricing power of firms substantially, making companies more 
reluctant to increase their prices than was the case after previous oil prices increases. 
In  addition  to  these  changes  to  economic  structures,  a  major  factor  in  containing  the  effects  of 
negative supply shocks is the enhanced credibility of the monetary authorities – what we might call 
changing institutional structure. Enhanced credibility can be seen as a consequence of the granting of 
independence to central banks and the fact that many more central banks are now charged explicitly 
with, and aim to achieve, the goal of price stability. The two major negative supply shocks of the 1970s 
and  the  differing  monetary  policy  reactions  to  them  can  be  considered  to  have  been  decisive  in 
changing attitudes towards monetary policy. This experience, in turn, led to the institutional changes 
just mentioned. 
The  oil  price  rises  of  1973-74  and  1979-80  were  both  accompanied  by  increases  in  inflation  and 
declines in output in most industrial countries. However, the monetary policy reaction to the shocks 
differed.  By  and  large,  the  first  oil  shock was  accommodated,  as  monetary  policy  was  loosened,  in 
order to offset the negative impact on growth; in contrast, monetary policy was significantly tightened 
after the second oil-price shock with the main focus of central banks on the containment of inflation12. 
The non-accommodation of the second oil price rise led to a contraction of output in the short run, but 
contained  the  inflationary  impact  of  the  shock.  It  can  be  argued  that  the  contraction  in  output  was 
larger than it otherwise might have been since monetary policy during the second oil shock had to be 
tightened  sufficiently  not  only  to  deal  with  the  second  oil  shock,  but  also  to  counter  the  inflationary 
pressures that remained from the first shock. Additionally, the fact that the monetary authorities did not 
aim  to  contain  inflation  during  the  first  oil  price  shock  implied  that  it  was  more  difficult  during  the 
second shock to alter expectations. Central banks thus faced a high cost, in terms of recessions, in 
their attempt to restore price stability in the 1980s. 
A  basic  conclusion  for  policy  making  that  emerges  from  these  two  episodes  is  the  following: 
inappropriate  policies  in  the  face  of  negative  supply  shocks  that  exacerbate  the  inflationary 
consequences of shocks ultimately lead to an economy paying a higher price over the medium run

11   This factor has been noted by Weber (2006), King (2006) and Liikanen (2006). The OECD (2006) calculates that, in the 
absence  of  the  effects  of  globalisation,  inflation  in  the  advanced  countries  taken  together  would  have  been  around  0.3 
percentage point higher over the period 2000-2005. See also ECB (2006a). 
12   Even  if  monetary  policy  was  tightened  eventually  in  the  aftermath  of  the  first  oil  shock  in  Germany  and  the  US,  it  was 
relaxed at the time of the shock.

than would be the case if the authorities pursued policies directed toward price stability. Inappropriate 
policies  in  the  short  run  make  it  more  difficult  for  the  authorities  to  stabilise  the  economy  during 
subsequent  shocks13.  Such  a  conclusion  is  confirmed  by  movements  in  headline  and  core  inflation 
after the first and second oil price shocks. Figure 7 shows the reaction after the first oil price shock; 
figure  8  after  the  second  oil  price  shock.  Core  inflation  responded  much  quicker  after  the  second 
shock; this provides support for the argument that inflationary expectations had become entrenched 
after the first shock, necessitating a strong dose of monetary tightening. 
Another  conclusion  that  emerges  from  the  above  discussion  concerns  the  difficulty  of  conducting 
policy in a world of uncertainty. Consider some of the changing relationships mentioned above. These 
include the decline in the energy intensity of production, the increase in global competition, including 
its effects on wage behaviour and profit margins, and the ascendancy of central-bank credibility. The 
upshot  of  these,  and  other,  changes  is  that  the  economic  world  in  which  we  function  is  the  best 
described  by  a  structure  whose  parameters  are  constantly  changing,  helping  to  explain  why  the 
predictions of the models about the effects of the most-recent oil price shock have been off the mark. 
The  challenge  for  the  monetary  official  is  to  operate  in  a  way  that  does  not  depend  on  a  fixed 
economic structure based on historically average coefficients. 
These lessons have been enshrined in the new institutional environment of monetary policy-making 
that  spread  throughout  industrial  countries  during  the  1990s.  By  recognising  the  limits  of  using  an 
activist  monetary  policy  in  a  world  characterised  by  uncertainty  and  changing  parameter  values, 
monetary  authorities  focused  their  attention  on  what  they  could  deliver  —  price  stability  over  the 
medium term. Crucially, that environment gave monetary policy a new credibility and created a regime 
of low inflation expectations. In such a regime, inflation is less sensitive to oil price increases. In the 
context  of  a  New-Keynesian  Phillips  Curve,  for  example,  inflation  depends,  inter  alia,  on  current 
expectations of future inflation. If expectations are solidly anchored, then inflation will not increase in 
response  to  a  negative  supply  shock  because  economic  agents  will  not  expect  a  rise  in  inflation. 
Therefore, the policy actions of the monetary authorities that aim at price stabilization, as well as the 
ability of the monetary authorities to communicate their policy commitments effectively to the public, 
have  kept  inflation  expectations  contained  and  contributed  significantly  to  the  muted  response  of 
inflation to this oil shock. 
In addition to not leading to a surge in inflation, the recent oil price shock has not led to the kind of 
recession experienced during the previous oil shocks. In part, this outcome may have something to do 
with the fact that the recent oil shock reflects, in part, buoyant demand for oil in the US, China and 
India. Consequently, the deterioration of the terms-of-trade in oil importing countries, appears to have 
been counterbalanced by higher demand for their goods from the countries that demand more energy. 
However,  again,  the  monetary  policy  framework  and  increased  credibility  of  monetary  policy  help 
explain the more muted output response. Central banks may face less of a trade off between output 
and  inflation14.  Because  the  dynamics  of  inflation  are  strongly  affected  by  inflation  expectations,  a 
credible central bank has the ability to contain inflation without substantially reducing output, since the 
knowledge that action will be taken if necessary may itself be sufficient. Indeed, evidence indicates 
that monetary policy effectiveness is the driving force behind improved macroeconomic performance, 
as measured by the reduction of inflation and output volatility15 (Figure 9). Underlying this increased 
effectiveness  lies  central  bank  independence  and  greater  transparency  which  gives  monetary 
authorities the chance to communicate their monetary policy objectives more effectively. 
The ECB’s two-pillar monetary policy framework, which takes account of real, monetary and financial 
factors,  provides  conditions  under  which  credibility  is  attained,  allowing  the  euro  area  to  reap  the 
benefits just discussed. The explicit goal of maintaining price stability, along with an actual quantitative 
                                                      
13   See Yellen, 2006. 
14   Woodford (2003). 
15   Cecchetti and Krause (2004) provide evidence supporting this view. Their results are based on the estimation of monetary 
policy efficiency frontiers, which are defined in terms of inflation and output volatility. One may, of course, argue that it is not 
the effectiveness of monetary policy that explains the better macroeconomic performance but rather the fact that there has 
been  a  reduction  in  the  variability  of  supply  shocks.  The  authors  divide  the  change  in  performance  into  the  proportion 
accounted  for  by  the  improvement  in  policy  effectiveness  and  the  proportion  that  is  due  to  changes  in  the  variability  of 
shocks.  They  find  that  for  the  majority  of  the  24  countries  analyzed  over  the  1980s  and  1990s,  more  effective  policies 
underlie the improvement in overall macroeconomic performance.

definition of stability as an inflation rate below but close to 2%, helps anchor inflationary expectations. 
Figure 10 shows how inflationary expectations have been anchored since the creation of the euro area 
and  the  ECB.  In  spite  of  the  slight  rise  in  expected inflation  since  the  early  years  of  economic and 
monetary  union,  expectations  remain  anchored  around  2%.  At  the  same  time,  new  information 
relevant  for  monetary  policy  formulation  is  assessed  in  Governing  Council  meetings  using  the  two 
pillars  –  the  economic  and  monetary  analysis.  The  economic  analysis  focuses  on  real  activity  and 
financial  conditions,  factors  that  influence  price  developments  in  the  medium  term.  The  monetary 
analysis provides a longer-term perspective based on the fact that inflation is ultimately in the long run 
a monetary phenomenon. Overall, the strategy does not justify short-term activism and efforts to “fine-
tune” the economy. 
The  existence  of  an  explicit  goal,  in  combination  with  the  current  framework  for  monetary  policy-
making, has been successful in enabling the ECB to establish credibility during its short history. The 
ECB’s institutional structure also facilitates transparent policy-making and the communication of policy 
decisions to the general public and financial markets. That this communication has been successful is 
supported  by  some  evidence  suggesting  that  the  ECB’s  focus  on  a  quantitative  definition  of  price 
stability has influenced price and wage setters in the euro area. Although prices tend to move very 
sluggishly in the euro area compared to, say, the US, inflationary shocks dissipate at a similar rate to 
the US – the extra rigidity in the euro area is offset by the benefits of the effectiveness of monetary 
policy in anchoring euro area inflationary expectations16. 
So  what  does  the  foregoing  analysis  imply  for  policy  prescriptions  now?  As  inflation  expectations 
appear 
to  follow  an 
accommodative monetary policy, riding the back of increased credibility. However, an accommodative 
monetary  policy  would  not  be  a  prudent  prescription  since  the  inflation  expectations  of  economic 
agents  may  rise,  ending  the  period  of  low  inflation  expectations.  Indeed,  if  inflation  expectations 
depend not only on current inflation, but also on average inflation in an earlier, higher inflation, regime, 
a large and persistent shock, such as a negative energy supply shock may well lead economic agents 
to raise their expectations that the monetary authority will shift to a higher inflation regime17. 
The credibility that monetary authorities have gained so far must not be jeopardized by loosening the 
tolerable inflation range. A credible central bank can help stabilize the economy during this oil shock 
without moving to a higher inflation target. Indeed, the credible central bank can take advantage of its 
credibility during an oil price shock because it faces less of a trade off between inflation and output 
than a less credible central bank. This situation enables the credible central bank to counter the shock 
through  a  smaller  tightening  of  monetary  policy  than  would  otherwise  be  the  case  because  the 
dynamics  of  inflation  due  to  expectations  are  self-contained18.  In  the  specific  case  of  the  ECB, 
credibility  and  well-anchored  inflationary  expectations  have  allowed  monetary  policy  to  be  quite 
accommodating  despite  actual  inflation  at  or  above  2%  for  more  than  two  years.  More  recently, 
however, there have been potential upside risks to inflation stemming from both real economic and 
monetary  developments. As  a consequence,  the  ECB  has acted  to  preempt  any  unfolding  of  these 
upside risks by withdrawing monetary accommodation. This circumstance underlies the rising rates in 
the euro area during the past year. 
to  be  appropriately  anchored, 
for  policy-makers 
it  may  be 
tempting 
A potential role for other economic policies? 
So far attention has concentrated on monetary policy responses to supply shocks. Before concluding, 
it is useful to make a few remarks on the potential role for other economic policies. 
First, an economy’s tolerance of negative supply shocks will be enhanced if labour market flexibility is 
increased.  This  fact  is  something  that  is  widely  recognised  and,  in  the  EU,  it  has  resulted  in  the 
adoption  of  various  policies  designed  to  reduce  rigidities  within  the  framework  of  the  Lisbon 
                                                      
16   ECB (2006b), p.79. 
17   See Gagnon, 1997. 
18   The idea underlying this argument is provided by Woodford (2003). Current inflation is a function of marginal cost (including 
changes in oil prices) and inflation expectations. If inflation expectations are well anchored they need not impact on current 
inflation  during  an  oil  price  shock  because  market  participants  know  that  the  central  bank  will  take  action  to  stabilize 
inflation. Hence, the amount of actual monetary  tightening will be less than that required by a less credible central bank 
because inflation will not have its own internal dynamic resulting from less-than-well anchored expectations.

Agreement. In the absence of central bank credibility, a monetary policy response to a negative supply 
shock is especially necessary because of the sluggish response of real wages to the shock. Negative 
supply side shocks increase marginal costs (either directly in the case of an oil price shock or through 
the need to employ more labour to produce the same output in the case of the negative productivity 
shock). Inflation in these contexts is the result of a lack of adjustment of real wages. Thus the more 
quickly real wages adjust, the more quickly actual output will converge to the new potential output. If 
economies  were  more  flexible,  then  the  challenge  for  monetary  policy  posed  by  a  negative  supply 
shock would be much reduced19. 
Second,  if  monetary  policy  is  focused  on  price  stability  and  anchoring  inflationary  expectations,  the 
potential recessionary effects of a negative supply-side shock could be countered through fiscal policy. 
If fiscal conditions give governments the flexibility to let automatic stabilisers work following a negative 
supply shock, tax revenues will fall and transfers increase, stimulating the economy. Moreover, a tight 
monetary  policy  that  aims  at  countering  the  inflationary  consequences  of  an  adverse  supply  shock 
could be accompanied by a discretionary fiscal expansion, i.e. a reduction in tax rates or an increase 
in government spending. The latter policies might further contain the recessionary impact of the shock 
by offsetting the negative effect of the oil price rise on private demand. Therefore, if government has 
the necessary flexibility, fiscal policy could lessen the stabilization burden of monetary policy. 
In the euro area, however, the scope for fiscal policy is, at present, limited because of the failure to 
tighten fiscal policy, during previous years when output was above trend. As a result, many countries 
have  been  left  with  significant  fiscal  deficits  and  high  debt  levels.  Even  the  room  for  automatic 
stabilizers to work, while staying within the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, is extremely limited. 
This  situation  highlights  the  need  for  governments  to  undertake  the  fiscal  reforms  necessary  to 
generate  a  fiscal  balance  or  surplus  over  the  economic  cycle.  Only  in  this  way  can  fiscal policy  be 
available as a tool to counter the impact of any future negative supply shocks. 
Conclusions 
To conclude, the message of this paper is that central banks should not respond to negative supply 
shocks  by  loosening  monetary  policy.  To  do  so  would  simply  undermine  the  credibility  that  many 
central  banks  have  worked  to  acquire  and  increase  the  costs  of  restraining  inflation  in  the  future. 
Rather central banks can exploit the credibility earned in the past – monetary policy is more effective 
with well-anchored expectations and this enables central banks to counter inflationary shocks at less 
cost. 
At the same time, other policies such as fiscal and, more importantly, structural have a significant role. 
We should not, after all, forget the classic lesson of Jan Tinbergen that there need to be just as many 
instruments  as  there  are  targets.  Monetary  policy  cannot  do  everything  and  it  is  far  better  that  it 
remains focused on what it is capable of achieving, namely price stability. In this way, it provides the 
conditions  necessary  to  achieve  other  macroeconomic  goals,  including  economic  growth  and 
employment creation.
