Jean-Pierre Roth: Demography and economic policy – the challenges ahead 
Summary  of  a  colloquium  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Swiss 
National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, on 
“Chances  et  défis  du  vieillissement”  (opportunities  and  challenges  of  demographic  ageing),  at  the 
University of Geneva, Geneva, 10 November 2006. 
The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 What  will  Switzerland  look  like  in  2050?  The  demographic  changes  under  way  will  have  a  strong 
impact on the future demographic landscape, with regard to both the working population and the older 
age  segments.  The  ageing  society  poses  two  major  challenges  for  economic  policy:  ensuring  the 
production capacity of the Swiss economy as well as the continuance of the social security scheme. 
To  address  these  challenges,  an  economic  policy  that  promotes  productivity  increases  while 
guaranteeing economic growth must be implemented with immediate effect. In line with this economic 
policy, adjustments must be made to our social security system.
