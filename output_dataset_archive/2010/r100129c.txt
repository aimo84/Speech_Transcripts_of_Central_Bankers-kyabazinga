José De Gregorio: The monetary policy report and the financial stability 
report 
Presentation  by  Mr  José  De  Gregorio,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  before  the 
Finance  Commission  of  the  Honorable  Senate  of  the  Republic,  Santiago  de  Chile, 
16 December 2009. 
 Introduction 
Ms President of the Finance Committee, senator Evelyn Matthei, senators. 
Thank you for your invitation to the Board of the Central Bank of Chile to share our vision of 
the  recent  macroeconomic  and  financial  developments  and  their  implications  for  monetary 
policy  making.  These  topics  make  up  the  contents  of  our  Monetary  Policy  Report  of 
December 2009 and our Financial Stability Report of the second half of 2009.  
As of this issue, the publication of our Monetary Policy Report is beginning a new frequency, 
changing  from  three  to  four  times  per  year.  In  addition,  the  publication  of  the  Reports  of 
December  and  June  will  now  coincide  with  our  two  Financial  Stability  Reports,  which  will 
continue to be released twice yearly. The purpose of this change is to share more often our 
vision  on  the  economy  and  the  rationale  of  and  prospects  for  our  policy  decisions,  a  key 
element to deliver a more effective and credible monetary policy. 
The year that we are leaving behind will be recorded in economic history as the one where 
the  world  economy  was  on  the  verge  of  collapse.  The  financial  crisis  that  shook  the 
industrialized world could have caused a major disaster with unimaginable consequences on 
developing economies, much more severe than actually occurred. 
Had  it  not  been  for  the  determination  of  the  economic  policymakers  around  the  world  to 
stabilize the financial systems and implement significant fiscal and monetary packages, the 
economic  performance  would  have  been  much  worse.  Nevertheless,  the  world  could  not 
prevent the “Great Recession”, the name with which this period has been already labeled, 
and world output will fall for the first time in sixty years. 
The  ability  of  macroeconomic  policies  to  react  promptly  was  particularly  important  for 
developing economies, cushioning the impact of the global crisis and making it much milder 
than in the past.  
Chile was no exception. As we said time and again from the onset of the crisis, our economy 
could not and would not be immune to the events occurring in the world. Nonetheless, as we 
have also insisted, the policy framework we have in place allowed us to mitigate the effects 
of the global economic scenario. Today, two weeks short of the end of the year, we know 
that although we were not spared the recession, its impact was much milder than we had 
been accustomed to. It is enough to recall just a couple of episodes. In 1982–1983, while 
Chile  saw  GDP  fall  dramatically,  the  world  economy  was  growing.  Measured  in  market 
prices, Chile’s GDP variation was around 18 percentage points below the world average. In 
1998–1999, this difference was close to 4 percentage points. But in 2009, the drop in output 
in  Chile  has  been  similar  to  the  world  average,  and  projections  for  2010  are  that  Chile’s 
economy will outperform global growth (figure 1).  
From  an  international  perspective,  the  resilience  of  the  Chilean  economy  also  stands  out. 
Considering  the  size  of  the  economy,  the  per  capita  GDP  and  the  terms  of  trade,  Chile’s 
output drop could have been around two percentage points higher than today’s estimates, 
with  negative  consequences  on  employment  and  the  quality  of  life  of  the  population 
(figure 2).

The response of fiscal and monetary policy, together with a strong, well regulated financial 
system, has been key in our capacity to recover from the shock of the crisis. Toward the end 
of  2008,  the  Board’s  first  actions  were  to  provide  the  necessary  liquidity  for  the  financial 
system to operate in full normality and to dissipate the uncertainties surrounding future peso 
and dollar liquidity conditions. Changing the monetary policy rate is useless if market rates 
cannot be guaranteed to follow suit. Once liquidity pressures had been contained and there 
were signs that inflationary pressures were easing off even faster than expected, the Board 
reduced decisively the MPR to the level we feel is the lowest possible without jeopardizing 
the good functioning of the money market.  
This has been one of the most significant monetary relaxation measures in the world, and is 
certainly  the  greatest  in  our  history  (figure  3).  Moreover,  the  low  inflationary  pressures  we 
were dealing with and the risk of inflation staying below the target range beyond the policy 
horizon  made  us  adopt  complementary  measures,  making  monetary  policy  even  more 
stimulative. Thus, apart from stating in all our communications that the MPR would be held at 
its lowest for a prolonged period, we created a long term liquidity facility (the FLAP), whose 
main purpose was to enhance the signal that the MPR would be kept low. 
This facility affected the structure of money market interest rates significantly. It reduced the 
expected MPR by nearly 100 basis points in the relevant policy horizon and led the market to 
adjust  expectations  about  how  long  the  MPR  would  be  held  at  its  lowest  level.  It  had 
important  quantitative  effects,  which  is  proof  of  its  success  in  incrementing  the  monetary 
stimulus.  In  November,  to  reduce  uncertainty  about  how  this  facility  would  operate,  we 
announced how and when we would withdraw it, but keeping a significant monetary impulse 
to help the closing of output gap and thus pushing inflation closer to the target. 
Now that the worst of the financial crisis has been behind us for one year, the international 
economy  has  stabilized,  uncertainty  has  declined,  and  the  world  is  resuming  moderate 
growth. In Chile, we have seen household and corporate confidence pick up, within a context 
of  highly  expansionary  macroeconomic  conditions.  Economic  activity  began  to  rise  in  the 
third quarter; the labor market stopped deteriorating, and financial conditions have become 
less stringent. Inflation is still negative and even below earlier projections. 
Unlike  developed  countries,  Chile  is  entering  this  recovery  phase  with  a  strong  financial 
system. Our banking system has, on average, similar or better solvency levels than it had in 
the years leading to the external financial crisis. This should allow the financing of investment 
and consumption during the economic recovery phase. Meanwhile, the market for bonds and 
commercial paper has become ever more important as a source of funding for larger firms. 
Risks remain, however, and the return to sustained growth in Chile and the world is not a 
done deal. In particular, macroeconomic packages need to be continued until the recovery is 
well  established.  Emerging  economies  and  commodity  exporters  deal  with  their  own 
tensions. Most recently, these have centered on the appreciation of their currencies, largely 
dependent on the US dollar. In Chile, with a floating exchange rate system, the peso is not 
spared  the  effects  of  the  world  events.  Certainly,  we  will  have  to  continue  monitoring  the 
exchange rate very closely. In particular, we will have to figure out its policy implications in 
order to ensure a persistent closing of the output gap and the return of inflation to the target. 
We foresee, as stated in the Monetary Policy Report, that the MPR will be kept low for an 
extended period, to reduce pressures on the strength of the peso and open the way for a 
sustained recovery of private demand. 
Next,  I  will  describe  the  latest  economic  and  financial  events,  projections  and  risks 
surrounding our economy, and the way in which inflation will converge to 3% over a two-year 
horizon.

BIS Review 9/2010
Macroeconomic scenario 
As  I  pointed  out  before,  the  international  economy  has  stabilized.  The  change  in  financial 
conditions has reduced risk premia, recovered key financial prices and restored investment 
flows towards emerging economies. Risk indicators are back to the levels they were before 
August 2007 (figure 4). 
The external borrowing conditions for Chile have also improved. Premia charged to Chilean 
banks  above  external  reference  rates  have  dropped  (figure  5).  The  dispersion  of  these 
premia is greater than before the crisis, which reveals more discrimination by the suppliers of 
credit and gives the right signals to potential borrowers by rewarding those with a stronger 
financial position. New external counterparties have also been observed in these operations. 
Other  constraints  remain,  however,  such  as  shorter  terms  for  the  loans.  Finally,  some 
Chilean  firms  have  placed  their  bonds  in  international  markets  after  shunning  these 
opportunities given the tight conditions by late 2008. 
Global  economic  activity  has  taken  a  path  to  recovery  that  is,  generally,  in  line  with 
projections  in  September’s  Monetary  Policy  Report.  Third-quarter  output  data  show  an 
upward  trend,  even  exceeding  expectations,  while  Consensus  forecasts  for  global  growth 
show  a  slightly  stronger  recovery  than  foreseen  earlier,  4%  on  average  for  2010–2011. 
However, the Board estimates that the risks of a weaker economy are still latent (figure 6). 
In  Chile,  domestic  demand  continues  to  reflect  substantial  inventory  depletion  and,  to  a 
lesser extent, a drop in gross fixed capital formation, particularly the machinery & equipment 
component (figure 7). 
Inventory  depletion  has  exceeded  September  projections  and  those  of  other  economies, 
shaving-off four percentage points of domestic demand in the last year. More recently, some 
indicators  suggest  that  the  inventory  cycle  is  entering  a  new  phase,  where  part  of  the 
depletion could respond to sales increasing faster than production (figure 8). The end of the 
drop  in  inventories  has  a  positive  effect  on  GDP  by  itself,  but  the  size  and  timing  of  its 
contribution  to  growth  is  still  uncertain.  This  will  depend  on  the  level  that  firms  consider 
adequate to face a cyclical recovery. It is very likely that such level will be smaller than it was 
before the global crisis. 
The adjustment of gross fixed capital formation has been similar to that of Asian economies, 
with quarterly drops of around 10% between end-of 2008 and beginning-of 2009 (figure 9). 
Weak investment is reflected in sluggish imports of capital goods, which are yet to show a 
rebound.  
Investments  in  engineering  and  construction  works  have  improved.  Although  a  fall  is 
expected for this year, information from the Capital Goods Survey shows a new increase in 
investment projects in the period 2009–2012, with some of them being pushed off from this 
year to the next one or two. Gross fixed capital formation will drop more than 15% annually in 
2009, which will presumably revert in part during 2010. The investment to GDP ratio will fall 
from its nearly 30% level of 2008, to 26% in 2010, both figures in prices of 2003. 
Private  consumption  has  been  the  component  of  domestic  demand  least  affected  by  the 
crisis,  and  is  expected  to  close  2009  with  a  slight  increase  driven  by  non-durable 
consumption. Consumer expectations have turned optimistic in the latest data, after two and 
a  half  years  in  the  pessimistic  zone.  The  not  so  restrictive  financial  conditions  have  also 
helped consumption and, most specially, its prospects. 
The  Banking  Credit  Survey  of  the  third  quarter  showed  that  more  banks  have  eased  their 
lending conditions, while at the same time demand for banking credit has increased from the 
previous  quarter.  The  increase  of  household  debt  recovered  slightly,  particularly  for 
consumer borrowing. The ratio between total household debt and disposable income fell in 
the last two quarters, as did the ratio between the financial burden (principal and interests) 
and  disposable  income.  This  latter  decline  obeys  to  both  a  fall  in  borrowed  amounts  and 
lower  interest  rates  (figure  10).  As  underscored  in  our  Financial  Stability  Report,  these 
BIS Review 9/2010

adjustments are welcome from a financial stability perspective, because of the higher risk of 
redundancy faced by households this year. Given the lags between the recovery of output 
and employment, both households and lenders must continue to be cautious for some time. 
The  performance  of  the  labor  market  also  supports  the  prospects  for  consumption.  Latest 
data show that the decline has stopped. After seasonal adjustment, employment has been 
increasing  since  the  second  quarter  of  last  year.  The  unemployment  rate,  although 
significantly up from late 2008, did not go as far as some projections foresaw and is already 
descending (figure 11). Lately, the velocity of the creation of salaried jobs has outperformed 
that  of  total  employment.  Although  aggregate  employment  has  not  restored  the  jobs  lost 
between late 2008 and early 2009, the drop in employment in this cycle has been milder and 
shorter than it was in the late 1990s, with less social costs from lost output. 
The countercyclical stimulus from fiscal and monetary policies has been determinant in this 
behavior of consumption (figure 12). Baseline projections consider the fiscal policy scenario 
contained in the Budget Law. 
The drop in external demand has been reflected on the volumes of shipments abroad, which 
are forecast to fall by nearly 3% annually this year. However, it is worth mentioning, on one 
hand,  the  improvement  in  mining  shipments  and,  on  the  other,  the  sharp  deterioration  of 
salmon exports in the past few quarters. Both factors, especially the reduced salmon exports, 
have affected GDP significantly. 
Thus, the baseline scenario of this Monetary  Policy Report foresees the Chilean economy 
growing between 4.5% and 5.5% in 2010, after dropping 1.9% in 2009. This growth rate is 
not  enough  to  fully  bridge  the  gaps  in  the  policy  horizon.  This  setting,  which  matters  for 
determining the inflationary pressures that will be facing our economy and the future path of 
the policy rate, is similar to what is forecast for other economies. In this scenario, the current 
account of the balance of payments will post a surplus of 0.6% of GDP in 2010 (table 1). 
As  for  costs,  imported  inflationary  pressures  have  remained  well  contained.  Baseline 
projections for the average prices of oil and copper have been revised up from September. 
The nominal peso/dollar exchange rate, in contrast, has appreciated substantially during the 
fourth  quarter.  Although  the  exchange  rate  fluctuations  along  an  extended  period  do  not 
differ substantially from that of other emerging currencies, these have occurred at different 
times. First, at the beginning of the most difficult period in world financial markets, the peso 
depreciated faster than other currencies. The weakest level occurred between late October 
and early December 2008, while other economies saw it closer to the turn of 2009. Second, 
its recent period of appreciation began strongly in mid-October 2009, while other currencies 
had  begun  in  July.  All  in  all,  at  the  statistical  closing  of  this  Monetary  Policy  Report,  the 
magnitude of the peso appreciation with respect to its through is fairly similar to that of other 
emerging currencies (table 2). 
This  difference  in  the  peso  performance,  at  least  since  July,  can  be  explained  by  local 
factors. The decoupling of the peso from the global trend of emerging currency strengthening 
with respect to the US dollar that began in mid-July, coincided with the building up of carry 
trade positions that used the peso as funding currency, and with increased dollar exposure of 
institutional  investors.  These  aspects  may  have  been  favored  by  the  low  level  of  the 
monetary policy rate and the adoption of complementary monetary policy measures. Later, 
some of these operations eased, and the peso aligned itself with the path of other emerging 
markets’ currencies (figure 13). 
Considering the nominal exchange rate at the closing of this Monetary Policy Report, the real 
exchange rate (RER) is within the range of values believed to be consistent with long-term 
fundamentals, so the baseline scenario uses the working assumption that, over the long run, 
it will be close to where it stands today. This level is nearly 6% lower than at the statistical 
closing of the September Report, and thus has an important effect on the projected path of 
inflation in the coming months which will be taken into account in future policy decisions.

BIS Review 9/2010
Labor  cost  pressures  show  no  significant  changes.  Y-o-y  growth  in  nominal  wages  has 
continued to fall, responding to the drop in inflation. Real wages deflated by the CPI have 
increased  but,  if  the  implicit  deflator  in  non-natural  resource  GDP  is  used,  they  fall.  The 
annual variation of unit labor costs increased because of the sharp cyclical fall in measured 
labor productivity. Such fall has been partly undone and is expected to continue to do so over 
the projection horizon. Trend growth projections are the same as in the previous Monetary 
Policy Report, that is, between 4.0% and 4.5% in the next two years. Beyond the projection 
horizon, a gradual return to trend growth figures approaching 5% is expected, to the extent 
that investment recovers and the general cost structure of the economy continues to reflect 
the lower energy costs. 
Annual CPI inflation has been negative since August, and the Board estimates it will become 
positive  over  the  course  of  the  first  half  of  2010  and  will  gradually  converge  to  3%  in  the 
monetary policy horizon, this time the last quarter of 2011. The progressive – yet incomplete – 
closing  of  the  output  gap  that  is  expected  in  the  projection  horizon,  together  with  higher 
commodity prices, explain headline inflation increasing faster than the core measures. Y-o-y 
changes in CPIX and CPIX1 will stay flat in negative figures for some months longer than 
CPI,  and  will  converge  to  3%  later  than  headline  inflation  (table  3).  Market  inflation 
expectations remain at 3% in the medium term, despite low inflation expected for the next 
few months (figure 14). 
Several factors determine inflation’s convergence to the target. In particular, this projection 
relies  on  the  external  scenario  steadily  adding  a  boost  to  economic  activity,  with  the 
recovering of confidence and global financial conditions gradually normalizing and allowing 
domestic and international demand to pick up. Domestically, monetary policy will remain 
expansionary,  which,  together  with  less  tight  financial  conditions,  also  backs  this 
projection. 
It is worth saying that these projections use as a working assumption that the policy rate will 
be kept at its low of 0.50% until at least the second quarter of 2010 and that its normalization 
will  occur  at  a  similar  pace  to  that  in  December’s  Economic  Expectations  Survey  (EES), 
which is more gradual than the one implied by financial asset prices in the two weeks before 
the statistical closing of this Monetary Policy Report (figure 15). 
The scenario outlined here is, as usual, subject to several risks. On one hand, doubts about 
how robust will the global economic recovery ultimately be still persist. The latest data have 
been better than predicted in several economies, but financial markets continue to react with 
volatility  in  the  face  of  unexpected  events  while  credit  losses  are  still  being  absorbed  by 
financial  intermediaries.  The  labor  market  situation  is  still  complex  in  several  economies, 
which, combined with the de-leveraging process under way, adds doubts about the capacity 
of consumption and investment around the world to regain strength. 
Another substantial risk has to do with the way in which central banks and governments will 
withdraw their unconventional monetary policy measures and fiscal and financial packages, 
and  how  this  could  affect  the  functioning  of  financial  markets.  Part  of  the  recent  relative 
stability relies on specific programs to support the financial system and in monetary policy 
conditions  that  have  allowed  access  to  liquidity  at  a  very  low  cost.  This  has  allowed 
generating  profits  that  strengthened  the  banks’  balance  sheets.  However,  credit  risk  in 
certain assets, such as the commercial mortgage portfolio of US and European banks is still 
high. The recent default in Dubai is one example of such risk being materialized, considering 
that Eurozone banks with systemic importance in the area show a high degree of exposure 
to this type of operations. 
Another  risk  comes  from  challenges  posed  to  macroeconomic  management  by  portfolio 
rebalancing or external savings being redirected to emerging economies which could cause 
significant increases in capital flows. Like its emerging peers, Chile has been at the receiving 
side of important portfolio investment flows. The difference is that outflows from institutional 
investors  have  been  particularly  high,  more  than  offsetting  the  inflows  (figure  16).  Another 
BIS Review 9/2010

risk, as has been said repeatedly, relates with uncertainty surrounding the persistent global 
imbalances. Domestically, it is possible that in the short run economic activity picks up faster 
than expected because of faster inventory replenishment. 
Also noteworthy is the risk associated to the trends of the different exchange rates and their 
effects on the RER. The RER has appreciated since September, with direct consequences 
on  projected  inflation.  The  Board  reiterates  that  it  closely  monitors  the  implications  of  the 
RER  level  on  inflation  and  compliance  with  its  monetary  policy  objective.  In  any  case,  the 
RER is within the range considered to be consistent with its long-term fundamentals. 
The materialization of any of these risk scenarios will have direct effects on domestic growth 
and inflation scenarios foreseen by the Board. After consideration of the aforesaid elements, 
the Board believes that the balance of risks for inflation and growth is unbiased. As pointed in 
the  Financial  Stability  Report,  these  risks  are  also  relevant  for  the  Chilean  economy’s 
financial stability. Therefore, banks and other financial intermediaries should consider these 
threats in their management and planning for 2010, assessing the adequacy of their capital 
base,  prudently  managing  their  liquidity  in  pesos  and  other  currencies,  and  actively 
diversifying  by  counterparties  and  credit  sources.  The  Board  will  continue  evaluating  the 
probabilities  of  these  risks  and  their  consequences  on  domestic  inflationary  and  financial 
stability prospects. 
Conclusions 
I  wish  to  wrap  this  presentation  with  some  brief  concluding  remarks.  As  I  said  at  the 
beginning,  the  last  eighteen  months  have  brought  events  that  will  be  forever  recorded  in 
world  history.  Chile  suffered  the  consequences  of  the  financial  earthquake  of  developed 
markets on confidence around the world. Economic activity dropped not only sharply but also 
with  unprecedented  speed.  The  same  happened  with  inflation,  which  was  in  its  long-time 
peak in October 2008 and is now in its lowest for decades. 
Activity  already  began  to  pick  up  in  the  third  quarter.  Although  the  y-o-y  variation  of  the 
Imacec  remains  in  negative  territory,  in  four  of  the  last  five  months  it  posted  a  monthly 
increase.  Furthermore,  as  suggested  by  these  projections  and  private  expectations,  in  the 
fourth  quarter  the  GDP  will  post  a  positive  annual  growth  rate.  Annual  inflation,  in  turn,  is 
expected  to  begin  rising  and  become  positive  during  the  first  half  of  2010.  Our  financial 
system has been able to weather the external turmoil and the Central Bank has taken actions 
to avoid inconveniences in the provision of liquidity and implemented a highly expansionary 
monetary policy, not just reducing the policy rate to its lowest possible. 
However many risks are still there and we must be extremely careful in our decisions. The 
economy is beginning a recovery process that is yet to be well grounded. Output gaps are 
significant and will close gradually; probably taking more than the next two years. Inflationary 
pressures are generally low. We have said in our communications that we will hold the policy 
rate at its lowest at least until the second quarter of 2010. 
However, it is not a mechanical commitment in the sense that after that time we will begin to 
withdraw the monetary impulse. Experience has taught us the importance of moderation, and 
a hasty withdrawal could severely hinder economic recovery and jeopardize convergence to 
the inflation target. As in earlier occasions, our inflation-targeting regime and the credibility it 
has earned allow us to handle monetary policy very flexibly. Accordingly, we reiterate that the 
Board will use all the policy tools at hand so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the 
policy  horizon.  As  I  have  also  said  repeatedly,  this  is  how  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile 
contributes to the Chilean economy’s growth and stability.
