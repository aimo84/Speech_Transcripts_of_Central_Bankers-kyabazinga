DeLisle Worrell: The Barbados economy in 2009 and prospects for 2010 
Economic statement by Dr DeLisle Worrell, Governor of the Central Bank of Barbados, at a 
news conference, Central Bank of Barbados, Bridgetown, 13 January 2010. 
 Overview 
As was to be expected in a country that is highly dependent on tourism, the performance of 
the Barbadian economy in 2009 was worse than in 2008, by most indicators. The impact of 
the economic and financial crisis in industrialised countries showed up in a contraction of real 
output,  a  reduction  of  foreign  exchange  inflows  and  an  increase  in  unemployment.  In 
addition,  the  fiscal  deficit  widened  because  of  a  decline  in  tax  revenue,  and  Government 
borrowed both locally and in Trinidad and Tobago to finance the widening gap. However, the 
deficit on the current account of the balance of payments narrowed as a result of the fall in oil 
prices,  which  reduced  import  payments  substantially.  The  key  to  economic  stability  in 
Barbados  is  the  maintenance  of  an  adequate  level  of  foreign  reserves,  and  the  Net 
International  Reserves  (NIR)  of  the  Central  Bank  remained  comfortably  above  the 
international  norm  for  fixed  exchange  rate  countries,  thanks  in  large  measure  to  capital 
inflows  and  an  allocation  of  Special  Drawing  Rights  (SDRs),  which  the  IMF  made  to  all 
member countries. 
The  projections  for  the  Barbadian  economy  in  2010  are  clouded  by  uncertainty  about  the 
pace and robustness of the recovery in the North American and European markets on which 
Barbados’  tourism  and  international  financial  and  business  sectors  depend.  Although 
Barbados has a strong showing in the higher income segments, which should be among the 
earliest to recover, prospects are for a small decline in real domestic output in 2010, based 
on  the  international  economic  projections  currently  available  from  the  IMF  and  other 
international organisations. Unless there is new borrowing, Government’s external debt may 
decline, because expected inflows from official borrowings are projected to be less than the 
amount  to  be  repaid  on  a  maturing  market  loan.  The  NIR  is  expected  to  be  boosted  by 
private capital inflows, as new projects come on stream, although the current account of the 
balance of payments is expected to show no further improvement. However, Government will 
need to achieve a reduction in the fiscal deficit in order to avoid excessive pressure on the 
NIR,  though  any  reduction  will  most  likely  be  modest  because  tax  revenues  will  remain 
depressed. 
The impact of the economic and financial crisis in 2009 
The  worldwide  economic  recession  led  to  a  broad-based  contraction  in  output  in  the 
Barbadian  economy  in  2009,  with  virtually  all  sectors  suffering  adverse  effects.  Tourism 
receipts, remittances and private capital inflows into Barbados all declined, as global output 
contracted,  international  credit  markets  remained  depressed  and  unemployment  rose  to 
double-digits  in  Barbados’  major  trading  partners.  Moreover,  the  unanticipated  depth  and 
protracted  duration  of  the  crisis  resulted  in  outcomes  markedly  worse  than  were  projected 
before the crisis deepened in September 2008 (See Table 1). 
Prior to the onset of the global economic recession, the Barbadian economy was forecast to 
slow to 1.8% in 2008 and then accelerate to 2.8% in 2009. However, it turned out that Gross 
Domestic  Product  (GDP)  stagnated  in  2008,  and  a  significant  contraction  of  5.3%  is 
estimated  for  2009.  The  crisis  is  estimated  to  have  cost  Barbados  almost  10  percentage 
points in economic growth over the two years. This in large measure reflected a drop in long-
stay arrivals over the two-year period of roughly 13.3% below the initial forecast, and a 3.9% 
decline  in  cruise  passenger  arrivals  over  the  two  years.  The  poor  performance  of  tourism 
depressed other major sectors of the economy, which provide services to the tourism sector.

The  crisis-related  loss  of  foreign  exchange  from  tourism  was  approximately  $170  million. 
This, coupled with an estimated shortfall of $465 million in private capital net inflows relative 
to initial forecasts, were the main factors in the estimated NIR shortfall of approximately $743 
million,  compared  to  pre-September  2008  expectations.  However,  foreign  reserves  were 
augmented by $232 million from a bond issue arranged by Scotiabank in the Trinidad and 
Tobago market, and by the allocation to Barbados of $170 million in Special Drawing Rights.  
The Scotiabank bond issue helped to support a widening fiscal deficit that was substantially 
greater 
in  economic  activity, 
government revenue was about 10% (or $548.5 million) less than the initial forecasts. The 
growing  deficit  was  compounded  by  a  greater  than  anticipated  expansion  in  Government 
expenditure, to the tune of $144.7 million, 2.5% more than expected.

Tourism performance 
After falling by 1.2% in 2008, tourism value-added plummeted by a further 8.7% in 2009, but 
the tourism sector’s contribution to total GDP remained around 15%. Preliminary data for the 
January-to-November period of 2009 suggests that the decline in output was due mainly to 
an  almost  11%  fall  in  long-stay  arrivals,  and  took  placed  in  spite  of  a  6%  increase  in  the 
number of landed cruise passengers (Figure 1 shows the relative contribution of long stay 
and cruise ship arrivals to tourism output). The contraction in tourism and other exports had 
knock-on  effects  on  other  sectors,  and  there  were  severe  declines  in  construction, 
manufacturing and non-sugar agriculture (See Figure 2).

With  the  exception  of  Canada,  tourist  arrivals  from  all  major  source  markets  were  down 
during 2009. Arrivals from Canada rose by an estimated 14%, mainly because of increased 
airlift  out  of  Western  Canada  and  greater  marketing  in  North  America.  Persistently  high 
unemployment in the U.K and U.S continued to restrict arrivals from these markets, which 
contracted by 13% and 9.8%, respectively. Visitors from Continental Europe and CARICOM 
fell  by  3.6%  and  11.2%  (Figure  3).  High  airfares  continued  to  depress  arrivals  from 
CARICOM countries, as they have since early 2007.

Arrivals  for  the  2008/2009  winter  season  were  2.6%  higher  than  for  the  similar  period  of 
2007/2008. Summer arrivals declined by around 9.6%, following a similar decrease of 5.4% 
during  the  comparable  period  one  year  earlier  (Table  2).  The  decline  in  tourism  was  very 
general, and is reflected in hotel bookings, hotel occupancy rates, employment in the tourism 
sector, and visitor arrivals during the Crop Over season (Table 3).

Government provided assistance to cushion the blow from falling arrivals by augmenting the 
Tourism  Industry  Relief  Fund  (TIRF).  Applications  for  financial  assistance  from  the  TIRF 
easily exceeded the Fund’s initial allocation of $15 million, and an additional $10 million was 
disbursed by year end.

The  outlook  is  for  a  small  contraction  in  tourism  in  2010,  with  recovery  beginning  only  in 
2011.  This  forecast  is  based  on  the  assumption  of  modest  economic  growth  in  Barbados’ 
major trading partners (the US and UK). Prospects are tempered by continuing job losses in 
those economies, and forecasts for additional job losses during 2010. The expected impact 
of  the  increase  in  the  UK  tourism  air  passenger  departure  tax  (APD),  implemented  in 
November 2009, will aggravate the decline in UK arrivals. However, the growth in Canadian 
arrivals should remain robust. 
International business sector 
Tight  global  credit  conditions  and  persistent  efforts  by  investors  to  reduce  their  risk 
exposures led inevitably to a further contraction of the international business sector, following 
the small decline observed in 2008. The number of new entrants fell, and there was a drop in 
the  value  of  corporate  tax  receipts  from  the  sector.  Up  to  September  2009,  new  licences 
were  only  a  little  more  than  half  the  number  recorded  in  2007  and  2008  (Figure  4).  After 
adjusting for $45.6 million in taxes due in 2008 but recorded in 2009, collections of income 
tax  from  firms  in  the  international  business  sector  for  the  first  three  quarters  were 
substantially below those of 2008 (Table 4). This decline, which follows contractions in both 
2007 and 2008, has had a noticeable impact on government revenue, as offshore receipts 
have on average accounted for 11% of total government revenue since 2005.

As  part  of  its  programme  to  strengthen  the  existing  bilateral  tax  treaty  network,  Barbados 
signed  an  additional  bilateral  investment  treaty  with  the  Belgium-Luxembourg  Economic 
Union  (BLEU),  bringing  to  ten  the  number  of  bilateral  investment  agreements  which 
Barbados  has  in  place.  In  addition,  the  number  of  double-taxation  agreements  in  force 
increased  to  18  as  the accord  between  Barbados  and  Mexico,  which was  signed in  2008, 
came into effect.  
Other exports 
Merchandise  exports,  as  well  as  receipts  from  goods  and  services,  continued  to  be 
negatively  affected  by  the  tapering  off  of  global  aggregate  demand  and  the  falloff  in 
commodity prices over the period. The decline in the output of goods (13.9%) was even more 
severe than for services (10.2%), and tourism continued to dominate total receipts during the 
period, contributing approximately 64% of total earnings during 2009 (see Figure 5).  
Figure 5: Domestic exports 
 Source: Central Bank of Barbados and Barbados Statistical Services 
 
Exports of domestically produced goods had shown robust growth (averaging 10.3%) during 
the five years (2004-2008) prior to the global financial crisis. Beginning in the last quarter of 
2008,  there  were  noticeable  declines  across  the  entire  spectrum  of  domestic  exports  as 
consumer demand waned. An additional factor in the decline of the production of chemicals 
was the closure of one of the island’s main producers due to fire in the later part of 2007. 
Altogether, physical exports (sugar, chemicals, electronic components, food and beverages, 
etc.) contributed 14% to foreign exchange earnings. 
Non-traded sectors 
The indirect effects of the slump in tourism activity were most keenly reflected in the non-
traded sectors, particularly wholesale & retail, transportation, storage & communications, and 
business & other services, which contracted for the first time since 2001-2002. In addition, 
waning  tourism-related  projects,  coupled  with  the  tight  credit  conditions  being  experienced 
internationally,  brought  a  number  of  real-estate  investment  projects  to  a  standstill, 
significantly retarding activity in the construction and mining & quarrying sectors. Mining and 
BIS Review 14/2010

quarrying  experienced  its  sharpest  contraction  in  more  than  a  decade,  while  the  drop  in 
construction  was  more  than  twice  the  rate  of  decline  recorded  in  2008.  Consequently,  the 
number of persons employed in construction and quarrying decreased by roughly 15%, while 
credit  to  the  construction  sector  and  mining  &  quarrying  fell  by  6%  and  19%,  respectively 
(Table 5). Output of electricity, gas and water also decreased during 2009 (Figure 6).

Inflation, employment and productivity 
The 12-month moving average inflation rate fell from 8.6% at the end of 2008 to 3.1% at the 
end of 2009, reflecting in large measure the return to normalcy of commodity prices during 
2008. Slumping domestic demand resulted in a higher unemployment rate, estimated at over 
10%  at  the  end  of  2009,  compared  with  8.1%  a  year  earlier.  Using  the  mid-year  2009 
estimate of the number of persons employed and estimates of the level of real GDP at the 
end of 2009, labour force productivity is estimated to have fallen by 4.1% over 2009. This 
reduction  is  roughly  comparable  to  that  of  the  2001  recession  in  which  labour  productivity 
declined by just under four percentage points, and it follows a seven-year period of increases 
in real output-per-employee.

 Financial sector 
The  discount  rate  on  Barbados  Treasury  bills  (T-bill)  continued  to  follow  the  medium  term 
trend in US T-bill rates. At the onset of the global financial crisis, the US T-bill rate declined 
rapidly  reaching  near-zero.  The  Barbados  T-bill  rate  declined  less  dramatically,  and  the 
spread  between  the  two  rates  as  at  December  2009  widened  beyond  the  two-percentage 
points average registered during the 2000 to 2007 period (Figure 8). In line with the general 
reduction  in  domestic  benchmark  interest  rates,  the  prime  lending  rate,  and  the  average 
savings rate also trended downward during 2009 (Figure 9).

Domestic  deposits  of  commercial  banks  declined  marginally  during  2009,  while  credit 
accumulation  was  severely  constrained  by  the  general  downturn  in  productive  activity. 
Notwithstanding the relatively flat performance in credit and deposits, liquidity in the banking 
system  continued  to  edge  upwards,  and  commercial  banks’  holdings  of  treasury  securities 
expanded. The excess liquidity ratio rose from 8.9% at end-December 2008 to 10.7% at end-
December 2009.

As the global financial crisis deepened, regional equity markets, which normally appear to be 
unrelated to developments in advanced markets, began to mirror the declines on the New

York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The Jamaican Stock Exchange (JSE)1 composite index was 
most responsive among the regional exchanges as its swings mirrored that of the NYSE. The 
composite index on the Barbados Stock Exchange fell by approximately 14.5% during 2009, 
while the Trinidad and Tobago, composite index contracted by approximately 9.2%. These 
declines translated into wealth losses of BDS $1.4 billion and TT $6.5 billion, respectively.

 Fiscal performance 
Following a significant worsening of the fiscal position in 2008, there was a further widening 
of the fiscal deficit to an estimated $564.6 million (8.4% of GDP) in 2009. This reflected a 
marked  slowdown  in  revenue  intake  on  account  of  the  weakened  domestic  economy  and 
increased Government expenditure. 
Revenues from the VAT, which had increased at an annual average rate of 6.5% between 
2001 and 2008, slumped by an estimated 18.1% in 2009. The VAT accounted for an average 
of 31.8% of Government revenues in the past five years, and the fall in VAT receipts in 2009 
was equivalent to a loss of 5.8% of total revenue. 
Despite a shrinking tax base, personal tax receipts rose significantly, on account of increases 
in  wages  and  salaries  in  both  the  public  and  private  sectors.  Corporate  taxes  had  been 
consistently increasing since 2003 at an annual average rate of 21.1% up to 2007, doubling 
over this period from $250.1 million to $499.8 million. However, intake from this category fell 
over  the  crisis-related  period  (2007/2009)  by  a  two-year  average  of  3.6%  or  $42  million2. 
Revenues from the import tax fell by 15.5% in 2009. 
                                                 
1   The Jamaican composite index was scaled down (by 100).  
2   The increase in corporate income tax in 2009 was in fact tax payments deferred from 2008.

Government expenditure rose by an estimated 3.4% in 2009, below the 14.1% increase in 
2008 and approximately equal to the average growth rate of expenditure in the 2001-2007 
period. The slower rate of expansion in current spending was primarily attributed to the lower 
rate of growth in transfers and subsidies, and a reduction in capital expenditure and interest 
payments.  
Transfers and subsidies were up by 5.1%, on top of an expansion of 19.3% in the equivalent 
period one year earlier. The University of the West Indies (UWI), the Transport Board (TB) 
and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) were the main beneficiaries.

In  addition  to  the  funds  allocated  to  the  Tourism  Industry  Relief  Fund  (TIRF)  to  assist  the 
ailing  tourism  sector,  Government  set  up  the  Employment  Stabilisation  Scheme3  to  assist 
businesses  with  their  operating  costs  provided  they  maintained  pre-crisis  levels  of 
employment.  Also,  a  $10  million  fund  was  created  to  facilitate  the  retraining  of  employees 
and  the  payment  of  a  stipend  to  participants  of  vocational  training  courses  who  were 
registered as unemployed by the National Insurance Board. 
Wages  and  salaries  by  government  rose  by  approximately  11.3%  during  the  year,  after  a 
moderate contraction of 1.7% in 2008, because of retroactive payments for 2008 and a 4.5% 
increment from the start of the FY 2009/10. Goods and services grew by 12.2%, compared to 
an increase of 24.4% in the similar period of 2008. In contrast, interest payments were down 
by an estimated 22.5%, primarily on account of lower repayment of foreign debt. 
Capital expenditure fell only marginally by an estimated 1.2%, as Government jump-started a 
number of projects aimed at boosting economic activity. Among these were improvements to 
the road infrastructure, the building of an office complex at Warrens and the construction of 
housing under its programme Housing Every Last Person (HELP).

Financing 
A  major  portion  of  the  deficit  was  financed  externally  by  proceeds  from  the  floatation  of  a 
US$120  million  bond  on  the  Trinidad  and  Tobago  market.  These  funds  contributed 
significantly  to  the  capital  and  financial  surplus and  helped to  boost  the  NIR.  Some  of  the 
deposits from this loan were placed with the Central Bank, and, along with other Government 
deposits  accumulated  by  the  end  of  year,  resulted  in  only  a  slight  rise  in  net  claims  on 
Central  Government  by  the  Central  Bank.  To  fund  the  remainder  of  the  fiscal  gap, 
Government continued to rely heavily on other domestic sources. The relatively high level of 
liquidity within the banking system allowed commercial banks to extend a substantial amount 
of credit to Government. The National Insurance Scheme and private non-bank institutions 
were also major financiers of the deficit.

Debt and debt service 
The projected costs of servicing the Government’s external debt appear to be well within the 
economy’s capacity, based on projected inflows from exports of goods and services. Interest 
costs  are  forecast  to  be  less  than  5%  of  inflows  in  2010,  and  the  percentage  declines 
thereafter.  Amortisation  costs  rise  to  a  forecast  8.5%,  with  the  repayment  of  the  US$100 
million bond in June 2010, falling to less than 4% in subsequent years. The interest costs of 
servicing  total  government  debt  are  projected  to  rise  to  18.2  percent  of  revenue  in  2010, 
declining gradually thereafter. The ratio of government debt to GDP rose from 90.8 percent in 
2008  to  110.2  percent  at  the  end  of  2009.  However,  approximately  25%  of  this  amount  is 
held by NIS. Net of NIS holdings, the government debt to GDP ratio is 82.7%.

Balance of payments 
During 2009, the NIR registered an increase of $143.7 million, following a $190.6 million fall-
off in 2008, raising the import cover from 16.6 weeks of goods and services to 20.7 weeks. 
However, in the absence of the bond issue in Trinidad and Tobago and the new allocation of 
SDRs, the NIR would have fallen $258.5 million. The factors responsible for the erosion in 
earned  foreign  reserves  included  lower  tourism  earnings  and  a  fall-off  in  merchandise 
receipts. However, a fall in import payments, largely due to the decline in oil prices, served to 
narrow the current account deficit to 6.9% of GDP, from 11.9% in 2008. Net private capital 
inflows  slumped  by  $247.4  million,  as  project  financing  was  considerably  lower  in  than  in 
2008

In 2010, the external current account deficit is projected to be slightly wider than that of 2009 
owing  primarily  to  a  pickup  in  retained  imports,  as  international  oil  and  other  commodity 
prices, as well as interest costs on external debt are projected to rise. Furthermore, travel 
credits are anticipated to be slightly down compared to 2009.

It is expected that there will be a pick up in project fund inflows during 2010. The continuation 
of real estate developments at Apes Hill, Lime Grove, St. Peter’s Bay and the Four Seasons 
BIS Review 14/2010 
 16
Resort, as well as new ventures such as Port Ferdinand and Beachlands should provide an 
increase of foreign financing. However, outflows will increase with the repayment of a $200 
million loan due in June 2010. Total financing is not expected to be sufficient to fully finance 
the  anticipated  external  current  account  deficit  in  the  absence  of  new  borrowing. 
Consequently, the NIR is projected to decline somewhat in 2010, and the foreign reserves 
cover may revert to the levels of 2008.
