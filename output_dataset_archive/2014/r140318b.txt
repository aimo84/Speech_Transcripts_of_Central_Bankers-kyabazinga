Introduction 
1. 
The economic and social costs of the double-dip recession that hit Italy over a brief period of 
time  are  very  great.  GDP  has  fallen  by  9 per cent  since  2007,  industrial  output  by 
25 per cent.  There  are  fewer  job  opportunities:  the  number  of  persons  in  employment  has 
fallen by 1 million, the unemployment rate is nearly 13 per cent, and more than 41 per cent 
among young people. The inequality indices have worsened: in 2012 the richest 10 per cent 
of households held 46.7 per cent of the country’s wealth, up from 44.3 per cent in 2008. The 
consequences of the crisis mainly affect the young, whose prospects are dim compared with 
past generations. 
The  crisis  originated  abroad,  but  its  effects  have  been  accentuated  by  the  structural 
weaknesses  of  the  Italian  economy,  the  first  of  which  are  the  high  public  debt  and  the 
delayed  response  of  industry  and  the  institutional  structure  to  technological  progress, 
globalization and the introduction of the euro. 
Italian banks successfully withstood the first wave of the crisis, which was financial in nature. 
However, the persistence of the recession and the sovereign debt crisis caused a worsening 
of  the  conditions  for  wholesale  funding  and  credit  quality,  especially  as  regards  business 
loans, which then undermined banks’ balance sheets. 
The  increase  in  the  amount  of  non-performing  loans  has  been  magnified  by  the  financial 
fragility  of  firms.  The  low  level  of  equity  and  the  consequently  high  debt  burden  have 
squeezed business profitability, reducing resistance to external shocks. The pre-eminent role 
of  credit  compared  with  market  financing  has  rendered  firms  vulnerable  to  a  tightening  of 
bank credit. These weaknesses were already present in the previous decade but have come 
to the fore during the recession. 
The  crisis  has  revived  the  unresolved  problems  of  the  Italian  financial  system:  the 
dependence  on  banks,  the  lack  of  developed  equity  and  bond  markets,  the  inability  to 
provide the productive system with resources other than credit. During negative phases of 
the  cycle,  this  situation  limits  lending  to  business  and  makes  it  more  costly,  entailing  high 
risks for banks, financial stability and economic activity. 
But the crisis also provides incentives to strengthen the role of the capital market and make 
the structure of the financial system more balanced. In the following pages, I will analyse the 
salient  points  of  these  themes  and  possible  ways  of  overcoming  the  financial  constraints 
which are still weighing on the Italian economy. 
Business credit and the financial crisis 
2. 
In 2000, following the start of monetary union, the ratio between banks’ business lending and 
GDP was at a similar level in the four leading euro-area countries, on the order of 35–40 per cent 
(Figure 1). 
Significant gaps emerged in the following years up to the global financial crisis: against a fall 
of  4 percentage  points  in  Germany,  the  ratio  increased  by  5 points  in  France,  15 points  in 
Italy and 46 points in Spain.

In  Italy,  the  growth  of  business  lending  was  fostered  both  by  strong  demand  and  by 
favourable  supply  conditions.  With  the  adoption  of  the  euro,  bank  lending  rates  fell, 
eliminating  the  spreads  relative  to  countries  with  a  longer  tradition  of  price  stability.  The 
availability  of  low-cost  wholesale  funding  allowed  banks  to  separate  the  growth  of  lending 
from that of retail funding. The share of loans not funded by retail deposits and retail bonds 
(the funding gap) rose from 10 per cent in the first few years of the century to 21 per cent in 
2008. 
During the financial crisis, credit conditions worsened. Since the autumn of 2008 growth in 
bank lending to the private sector has gradually slowed, becoming negative for the first time 
in the course of 2009 and again from the end of 2011 to the present.1 The contraction in the 
last two years has been marked as regards lending to business, which declined by €98 billion 
against a reduction of lending to the private sector of €114 billion (Figure 2). 
Besides the fall in demand connected with the recession, the contraction in lending reflects 
banks’ restrictive lending standards.2 It is estimated that, in 2012, the more stringent lending 
criteria  determined  an  8 per cent  contraction  in  the  stock  of  loans  and  an  increase  of 
2 percentage  points  in  lending  rates.3  The  credit  strains  had  negative  repercussions  on 
investment  and  therefore  on  growth;4  hardest  hit  were  small  firms  and  new  business 
initiatives: in the first three months of 2013 the balance of business start-ups and closures 
(7,700 firms) was eight times lower than in the three-year period before the crisis.  
With tensions on the funding side resolved following intervention by the Eurosystem, supply 
constraints reflect, above all, the deterioration in the creditworthiness of non-financial firms. 
Loans  to  firms  with  repayment  difficulties  (“non-performing  loans”)  account  for  almost  a 
quarter of all credit to the sector, increased by 10 percentage points in only two years; within 
this aggregate, the component with the highest probability of loss for the banks (“bad debts”) 
accounts  for  12  per  cent  of  loans  (Figure  3).  Credit  losses  absorb  a  large  part  of  banks’ 
operating profits. 
The scarcity of credit is set to continue in the months to come. Empirical evidence indicates 
that  the  deterioration  in  loan  quality  tends  to  extend  well  beyond  the  start  of  a  cyclical 
recovery.5  Moreover,  banks  are  reducing  the  size  of  their  balance  sheets  in  response  to 
factors of a structural nature, such as market pressure to reduce leverage and the tightening 
of the capital and liquidity requirements under international regulations (Basel III). 
In the euro area, the banks’ caution is also fueled by the transition to the Single Supervisory 
Mechanism. Once the mechanism is operational, it will help to dissipate fears about banks’ 
soundness  and  eliminate  the  financial  and  regulatory  segmentations  and  constraints  that 
now weigh on the European credit market. In particular, the comprehensive assessment of 
banks’  balance  sheets  by  the  ECB  and  national  supervisory  authorities  will  increase  the 
information available and strengthen banks’ capitalization.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
The exercise will be conducted with uniform rigorous standards in all the member states; all 
the main sources of risk will be evaluated, avoiding excesses that instead of reassuring the 
markets would only reinforce the spiral between sovereign debt and bank risk. 
The path to the Single Supervisory Mechanism is not without risks, however. In the short run, 
uncertainties about how the comprehensive assessment is to be conducted could heighten 
banks’  caution,  thereby  compressing  credit  supply.  A  transparent  policy  of  communication 
can  mitigate  these  uncertainties  but  cannot  eliminate  them  entirely,  since  the  enormous 
complexity of the exercise makes it impossible to shorten the time needed to complete the 
comprehensive  assessment.  During  the  construction  of  Banking  Union,  moreover,  its 
incomplete structure might not be sufficient to protect the economy and the public finances 
from the consequences of banking crises. 
Firms’ financial fragility 
3. 
A  reflection  is  necessary  on  the  origin  of  the  constraints  on  lending  to  businesses  and  on 
how  they  may  be  overcome.  Analysis  must focus  in  particular  on  the factors that together 
with the recession increase credit risk which, as we have seen, is a powerful obstacle to the 
supply of loans. The recent financial tensions have generally been viewed in relation to the 
problems of the banks, which in turn are connected to the recession and the sovereign debt 
crisis. While such an approach was comprehensible at the height of the crisis, it overlooks 
the problems deriving from firms’ financial fragility. 
The rapid expansion of bank lending between 2000 and 2008 had its counterpart in that of 
the debt of non-financial corporations (Figure 4), which rose as a proportion of value added 
by more than 50 percentage points, to 178 per cent. 
The growth in corporate debt was not paralleled by a strengthening of firms’ ability to support 
its  cost:  productivity  stagnated,  profitability  worsened  (Figure  5);  the  portion  of  investment 
covered by self-financing fell to the historic low of 38 per cent. Above all, firms’ equity did not 
keep pace with their indebtedness: their leverage ratio6 rose from 34 to 43 per cent, and this 
helped drive up their net interest expense in relation to gross profits. 
Italian firms’ leverage is also relatively high by international standards (Figure 6). According 
to  the  financial  accounts,  in  2012  it  exceeded  the  euro-area  average  and  the  figure  for 
Germany by 6 percentage points and was 14 points higher than in France. Comparable gaps 
existed  in  the  years  before  the  crisis.  The  results  do  not  change  when  firm-level  data  are 
used.7 Based on a sample of 600,000 euro-area companies, in 2010 Italian firms’ leverage 
was higher than the others’ in nearly every sector and size class (Figures 7 and 8).8 
These differences do not reflect composition effects. According to econometric analyses that 
take account of the main firm characteristics bearing on indebtedness,9 Italian firms’ leverage 
is 11 percentage points higher than the average for the other countries. The gap is wider for 
smaller  companies,  while  it  is  virtually  nil  for  very  large  companies  (assets  of  more  than 
€300 million). 
                                                
6  Financial debts in relation to the sum of shareholders’ equity and financial debts. 
7  The financial accounts do not allow us to tell if the differences between countries reflect the composition of the 
productive economy by sector and firm size. In addition, they include shareholders’ equity at market prices, 
which makes international comparisons depend on the performances of the stock markets.  
8  The data are from the Amadeus database, which includes financial statement information for companies of 
46 countries. 
9  Leverage  was  analyzed  by  means  of  panel  regressions,  including  a  dummy  for  Italian  firms  among  the 
independent variables. The control variables included dummies for sectors, size classes and age groups, as 
well as financial statement variables (profitability, technical fixed assets, liquidity and sales growth).

Towards a more diversified financial system 
4. 
A  continuation  of  the  present  financial  tensions  would  entail  high  risks  for  the  Italian 
economy. The exit from a recession is slower in the presence of a financial crisis or a credit 
squeeze;  in  such  situations,  lending  normally  begins  to  revive  half  a  year  after  GDP.10  In 
Italy, as elsewhere, lending to businesses has lagged the real economy and been influenced 
by the presence of restrictions on credit supply (Figure 9). 
In  order  to  ensure  the  full  functionality  of  the  financial  system  and  provide  adequate 
resources  to  Italian  firms  in  view  of  the  cyclical  upturn,  both  short-term  and  structural 
measures  are  needed. The tensions  in  the  credit  market  and  the financial  fragility  of firms 
reflect  contingent  factors  –  the  recession  and  the  sovereign  debt  crisis  –  but  are  closely 
bound up with the weaknesses of the Italian financial system: the over-reliance of firms on 
bank credit and insufficient direct fund-raising on the markets. A financial set-up of this kind 
is especially penalizing in the present conjuncture. 
The  negative  effects  on  credit  supply  of  the  high  risk  of  default  must  be  counteracted. 
Looking  further  ahead,  it  is  necessary  to  foster  the  development  of  a  diversified  financial 
system in Italy in which the role of the capital markets and institutional investors is on a par 
with that in the other main countries. These issues are addressed in the following pages. 
4.1 Bank credit 
The  instruments  best  suited  to  tackling  the  “market  failure”  at  the  root  of  the  current 
malfunctioning  of  the  credit  market11  are  based  on  systems  that  guarantee  bank  loans  to 
firms, and to smaller firms in particular.12 
Since the onset of the recession the Guarantee Fund for small and medium-sized enterprises 
has been appropriately reinforced, through an increase in its endowment, the widening of the 
range of potential beneficiaries, and the broadening of the eligibility criteria. A government 
backstop guarantee was introduced, relieving banks from capital charges for loans covered 
by the Fund. Thanks to the leverage effect and to diversification, the interventions weigh only 
moderately on the public finances. 
In recent years the flow of loans guaranteed by the Fund has risen rapidly. Between 2009 
and 2012 guaranteed loans amounted to €31 billion, assigned to 127,000 mostly small firms. 
At the end of 2012 the stock of such loans accounted for 3.5 per cent of loans to firms with 
less than 20 workers in the sectors where the Fund operates. In the first ten months of 2013 
guaranteed  loans  amounted  to  €8.5 billion  (Figure  10),  up  by  23 per cent  from  the  same 
period in 2012. 
According to preliminary analyses conducted by the Bank of Italy, the guarantee provided by 
the Fund supported the growth in bank lending to the beneficiary firms.13 The effects on the 
cost of lending appeared instead less clear-cut; this may be attributable in part to how the 
Fund operated in the past, when it allowed banks to obtain a guarantee after the loan had 
been disbursed, and therefore after its terms had been defined.

intermediaries’ risk aversion, giving rise to credit rationing. See J. Stiglitz, and A. Weiss, “Credit Rationing in

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
Over the coming months the Fund’s activities may benefit from the changes introduced under 
Law  98/2013  and  the  2014  Stability  Law.  However,  these  must  be  implemented  rapidly: 
some of the changes, in particular those designed to facilitate the granting of guarantees to 
firms  whose  balance  sheets  have  been  weakened  by  the  recession,  are  still  awaiting 
implementing  decrees. Moreover,  the  prospect that  a  portion  of the funds  assigned  by  the 
Stability  Law  could  be  channelled  to  other  areas  of  activity  and  for  purposes  other  than 
supporting firms, risks dissipating the Fund’s resources and eroding its effectiveness. Finally, 
to stimulate the supply of loans there is a need to introduce mechanisms that reward banks 
with the highest rates of increase in total lending. 
Further  interventions  to  support  credit  have  been  made  by  the  public  sector  through  the 
Cassa Depositi e Prestiti.14 In the private sector, the moratoriums agreed between the Italian 
Banking  Association  and  firms’  associations  have  enabled  many  SMEs  to  weather  difficult 
times. 
But to get the credit channel working again, banks must first and foremost commit to taking 
full account of their customers’ growth potential. The pressure on banks to deleverage and, 
in the years leading up to the crisis, the growing importance of types of financing that can be 
sold  on  the  market  may  have  impaired  the  ability  and  incentives  for  banks  to  analyze  the 
prospects of the various business sectors and carefully assess borrowers’ creditworthiness. 
This negative trend must be halted, by intensifying efforts to examine the characteristics of 
firms, and of smaller firms in particular. Banks must be aware of the negative effects for the 
entire Italian economy, and for themselves, of an indiscriminate credit crunch. 
4.2 Equity capital 
In  addition  to  credit,  Italian  firms  require  equity  capital,  in  order  to  support  the  economic 
recovery and ensure more stable financial conditions. 
It  is  estimated that  in  order  to  bring the  leverage  of  Italian  non-financial  companies  in  line 
with the European average would require the conversion into equity of debt totaling between 
€150 and €220 billion.15 Such an operation would be considerable in scope but feasible over 
the medium term: if completed within five years it would require the transformation into equity 
every year of debts corresponding to 3 per cent of the total; it would be less arduous during a 
period of economic growth, above all if accompanied by the reinvestment in firms of a large 
portion  of  the  earnings  distributed  every  year  to  shareholders  in  the  form  of  dividends 
(€60 billion on average in 2011–12, based on Istat data). 
The  rebalancing  of  the  sources  of  financing  requires  interventions  on  several  fronts.  First, 
incentives  for  incurring  debt  must  be  eliminated.  Of  these,  high  taxation  plays  a  non-
negligible role, both directly and indirectly. 
Heavy  taxation  of  firms’  earnings  increases  the  advantages  of  borrowing  with  respect  to 
other forms of financing, owing to the deductibility of interest payments from annual earnings. 
Italy’s high tax rates enable firms to deduct a larger proportion of financial costs from taxable 
income than is possible elsewhere. It is estimated that this explains much – about one fourth 
– of Italy’s unfavourable leverage gap with respect to other European countries.16 
                                                
14  Since the onset of the crisis the CDP has constituted funds on which banks can draw at a low cost in order to 
provide medium  and  long-term  credit  to  SMEs.  The  SME  credit  line,  set  up  in  2009  with  an  endowment  of 
€8 billion, has been fully exhausted; the “new SME credit line”, operational since 2012, has an endowment of 
€10 billion, most of which has not yet been disbursed to firms.  
15  This estimate is based on the data discussed in Section 3, which maintains unchanged the total value of firms’ 
financial liabilities (i.e. only modifying the debt-to-capital ratio).

High 
the 
underdevelopment of the stock exchange does not stem from a lack of listable companies.17 
It  mainly  reflects  the  choices  of  firms  themselves:18  Italian  firms,  characterized  by  a  high 
degree of concentration of equity in the hands of a few people, often linked by family ties, are 
reluctant to open up. Increasing firms’ size and turning to the markets imply costs associated 
with  greater  exposure  to  supervisory  authorities,  minority  shareholders,  and  above  all  the 
taxman, given the excessively burdensome level of taxation. 
One  reason  for  the  lack  of  interest  in  stock  exchange  listing  is  the  strong  desire  to  retain 
control  of  the  firm,  sometimes  even  at  the  cost  of  doing  without  the  financial  and 
management resources needed to stay ahead of international competition. This goes against 
what  empirical  analyses  tell  us.  After  a  firm  has  been  admitted  to  the  stock  exchange,  its 
financial structure becomes sounder, with a bigger share of bond issues and a smaller share 
of short-term loans. Listing also allows the firm to cut the cost of bank loans by improving its 
risk profile and its reputation.19 
Signs  of  renewed  interest  in  the  stock  exchange  have  emerged  in  recent  months.  Some 
twenty Italian companies have gone public since January last year, the largest number since 
2007; others have announced similar plans. Most of these firms are small and medium-sized 
non-financial  companies  that  decided  to  list  on  the  alternative  investment  market  (AIM) 
where listing costs and regulatory requirements are lower than on the main stock exchange. 
Tax incentives for company listing or equity finance have been used on several occasions in 
the past to promote the growth of the stock exchange.20 The measures had limited success 
because of the temporary nature of the tax benefits, which meant they could not fully offset 
the firm’s perceived cost of listing, including the cost of transparency. 
The  tax  allowance  for  corporate  equity  introduced  in  2011  as  part  of  the  package  of 
measures to aid economic growth reduces the tax advantage of debt relative to equity capital 
and  will  hopefully  go  some  way  to  overcoming  the  above-mentioned  limits.  However,  our 
research  indicates  that so far  the  effects  have  been  limited: fewer  than  2 per cent  of firms 
report  they  increased  their  shareholders’  equity  in  2012–13  to  take  advantage  of  the 
allowance. This result may be due not only to the lack of profits available to reinvest in the 
firm,  but  also  to  the  small  size  of  the  incentives,  which  need  to  be  sufficiently  large  and 
permanent in the eyes of the firm if they are to be effective.21 
                                                
17  See the Technical Planning Document drawn up by the Working Group for the admission to listing of SMEs 
(March 2013). Based on a comparison with France, where the productive system differs from the Italian one, it 
is estimated that as many as 500 Italian companies are eligible for listing.  
18  See F. Panetta, “Banks, Finance, Growth”, speech delivered at the conference “Beyond the crisis: What lies in 
store  for  Italian  banks?”,  organized  by  the  Associazione  per  lo  Sviluppo  degli  Studi  di  Banca  e  Borsa  in 
conjunction  with  the  Università  Cattolica  del  Sacro  Cuore  of  Milan  (2013).  See  also  Pagano,  Panetta  and 
Zingales, “Why Do Companies Go Public?”, Journal of Finance (1998). 
19  See Pagano, Panetta and Zingales, ibid. 
20  Incentives were granted for equity finance and company listing under the Visentini Law (1983), the Tremonti 
Law (1994), the Dual Income Tax measure (1997) and the Tecno-Tremonti Law (2003). 
21  The advantage of borrowing in terms of taxation can be eliminated quite simply by bringing the notional rate of 
the tax allowance for corporate equity into line with the long-term risk-free interest rate. See R. Broadway and 
N.  Bruce,  “A  General  Proposition  on  the  Design  of  A  Neutral  Business  Tax”,  Journal  of  Public  Economics,

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
The larger tax allowance introduced under the Stability Law for 2014–16 is a step in the right 
direction. Other incentives covering a longer time frame could be offered to newly listed firms 
without encroaching too much on government revenue.22 
4.3 Non-bank financing 
During  the financial  crisis  Italian firms  turned  increasingly  to  the  bond  market.  Placements 
have  averaged  €30  billion  a  year  since  2009,  with  peaks  of  over  €35 billion  in  2009  and 
2012,  when  it  was  hardest  to  access  bank  credit  (Figure  11).  Issuance  was  substantial  in 
2013 as well, amounting to €29 in the first nine months. 
While bond issuance continues to lag behind the levels of other advanced countries and its 
costs remain relatively high, the upturn is a clear step forward with respect to the pre-crisis 
period  (bond  issues  averaged  €19 billion  a  year  in  2005–07).  Thanks  to  their  bond 
placements firms have become less dependent on bank lending: out of the 250 main Italian 
industrial groups, the 80 that made bond issues in 2009 also reduced their bank borrowing 
by a third, while the others increased it by 12 per cent. 
The progress in overall bond issuance masks differences between the various size groups of 
firms,  however.  In  fact  the  increase  in  placements  concerns  only  a  small  number  of  large 
firms,  while  the  value  and  volume  of  placements  by  small  and  medium-sized  firms  has 
declined (Figure 12).23 The number of small firms going to the bond market for the first time 
has  progressively  diminished  and  the  number  of  medium-to-large  firms  has  remained 
stationary. 
Last year, issuance by unlisted companies was encouraged by the tax benefits offered under 
the economic growth decree of June 2012 which created so-called minibonds. Twenty or so 
of these issues were placed for a total value of about €5 billion. Once again, small firms took 
little advantage of the opportunity. 
The difference between placements by large and small firms mirrors the difficulty SMEs have 
in placing small-value, and hence illiquid, bond issues and in approaching major investors, 
particularly from abroad. A further problem is the difficulty of assessing the creditworthiness 
of small firms, particularly during the current recession. These factors lead to placements of 
illiquid, high-yield securities.24 
The  problems  SMEs  encounter  in  accessing  the  bond  market  opens  up  a  range  of 
opportunities for specialized intermediaries able to assess the credit rating of small firms and 
practice  investment  strategies  designed  to  diversify  idiosyncratic  risk  over  the  medium-to-
long term. 
Several  projects  are  under  way  to  create  instruments  for  investing  in  bonds  or  loans  of 
unlisted companies, most of them based on the creation of closed-end credit funds. This may 
help  to  channel  funds  rapidly  to  issuers  and  create  a  market  that  could,  as  it  reaches  a 
suitable  size  and  becomes  sufficiently  liquid,  attract  even  major  institutional  investors. The 
success of such projects depends on a high degree of transparency, simple structures, low 
leverage, and limited maturity mismatching.

Credit funds can make a far from negligible contribution to diversifying firms’ funding sources, 
particularly the medium-to-long-term component. 
4.4 Securitizations 
The transformation of Italy’s “bank-centred” financial system to one in which firms, including 
smaller firms, can directly tap market financing is an ambitious objective, attainable over a 
lengthy time horizon. It may require significant legal and fiscal adjustments. It presupposes 
changes in the behaviour of banks and firms. In the transition between these two models of 
corporate  finance,  consideration  should  be  given  to  the  possibility  of  exploiting  synergies 
from combining intermediaries’ activities with those of the markets. 
One  such  possibility  is  offered  by  securitizations,  which  allow  the  separation  of  the  typical 
banking  functions  –  screening  borrowers  and  originating  loans,  which  continue  to  be 
performed by the bank – from financing proper, which is shifted to the market. In practical 
terms, the securities generated constitute the synthetic replica of a bond portfolio, but with 
the significant difference that the task of debtor selection and screening is left to the bank, 
not to the final investor, as in the case of corporate bonds. The senior tranche of an asset-
backed security, unlike the underlying loan, can be sufficiently transparent and liquid to be 
placed with unsophisticated investors. 
Securitizations  accordingly  enable  firms  to  reach  institutional  investors  without  bearing  the 
costs of stock exchange listing or bond issues. They enable purchasers to delegate the task 
of  procuring  information  to  banks,  which  are  in  a  better  position  to  perform  it.  In  addition, 
securitizations can alleviate the problem of mismatching of demand and supply that can arise 
in  illiquid  markets  when  companies  have  trouble  issuing  securities  because  “there’s  no 
demand” while demand itself is slack because the scarcity of outstanding securities means 
that for investors “it’s hard to diversify”. 
With the crisis, the securitization market has practically dried up. I won’t go into the reasons 
for this collapse – the potential risks of a perverse intermingling of intermediaries, markets 
and securitizations are known well enough. But Italy’s experience in recent years shows that 
attentive  banking  supervision  makes  it  possible  to  combine  the  two  functions  in  virtuous 
fashion, providing the right incentives to banks and mitigating information asymmetry.25 
In  the  decade  preceding  the  crisis,  in  a  favourable  economic  environment,  Italian  banks 
reduced the impaired loan assets in their portfolio, among other things through substantial 
securitizations. In coming months the volume of such operations may be fueled by several 
factors: the cyclical recovery will improve borrowers’ creditworthiness, bolstering specialized 
intermediaries’ demand for impaired assets; an analogous effect will continue to come from 
the  concomitant  reduction  of “Italy  risk”,  as  evidenced  by  the  narrowing  of the  spreads  on 
government bonds. The supply of impaired loan assets by banks should also grow, owing to 
the  increase  in  value  readjustments  and  the  recent  regulatory  changes  bringing  less 
unfavourable tax treatment of write-downs and loan losses. The resumption of securitizations 
will interact positively with the need to diminish the stock of impaired loans in order to free up 
resources to finance economic activity.26 
Conclusion 
5. 
The  Italian  economy,  after  protracted  recession,  is  heading  towards  a  cyclical  upturn.  The 
signs of improvement that emerged last spring are strengthening. Last summer the decline in 
GDP came to a halt, and in the fourth quarter industrial production apparently gained around

one per cent. The quarterly change in GDP appears to have been positive for the first time 
since mid-2011. 
Italy’s financial markets are benefiting from the decreasing financial fragmentation of the euro 
area.  The  revival  of  foreign  investors’  appetite  for  Italian  assets  has  been  reflected  in  a 
reduction  in  the  Bank  of  Italy’s  debtor  position with  the TARGET2  payment  system,  which 
has diminished by a third from the high mark of €290 billion registered during the summer of 
2012. 
The economic picture nevertheless remains fragile. International financial tensions are again 
threatening  global  market  stability.  The  Italian  economy  is  improving  only  slowly,  with 
considerable unevenness both geographically and by sector. 
To  maintain  the  recent  positive  signs  and  convert  them  into  sustained,  robust  economic 
growth  that  can  cut  significantly  into  Italy’s  high  unemployment  will  require  the  country  to 
finally tackle and begin solving a series of well-known structural problems on which action 
has been deferred for too long. 
Another necessity is adequate financial support for firms. There can be no return to growth 
without the contribution of banks and markets. 
Past efforts to foster the development of a more diversified financial system – one in which 
the  importance  of  markets  and  institutional  investors  is  comparable  to  the  other  leading 
countries – have not yielded the hoped-for results. The recession, the increase in credit risk 
and  the  resulting  credit  supply  strains  have  nevertheless  created  incentives  for  firms  and 
banks to renew those efforts, to make them more effective and to expand direct finance to 
the productive economy. 
In recent months Italian firms have shown a greater propensity to turn to the capital market. 
Both  bond  issues  and  new  stock  exchange  listings  have  increased.  But  market  recourse 
remains modest and for the most part limited to larger companies. Small businesses have 
not taken proper advantage of the opportunities for direct financing. 
Banks  can  be  essential  in  encouraging  direct  access  to  the  markets  for  larger  firms  and 
pointing  smaller  ones  in  the  same  direction.  If  they  accompany  firms  with  good  growth 
prospects into the market, developing corporate finance services that take less capital and 
liquidity, they can curb risks and improve earnings. To attain these objectives they need to 
strengthen relationships with firms and avoid conflicts of interest. 
Firms  too  must  contribute  to  the  development  of  the  capital  market.  Corporate  financing 
needs  cannot  be  met  by  bank  credit  alone.  Diversifying  funding  sources  will  require  a 
commitment to greater accounting transparency, openness to outside parties, and above all 
capital strengthening. In order to gain the support of banks and investors, entrepreneurs will 
have to be the first to demonstrate their own faith in the prospects for their business. 
The task of economic policy is to remove the obstacles, to provide incentives to ensure that 
the development of the capital market gathers momentum and, above all, that it does not flag 
as in the past. Like the rest of the Italian economy, this process would benefit from an easing 
of the tax burden on firms.
