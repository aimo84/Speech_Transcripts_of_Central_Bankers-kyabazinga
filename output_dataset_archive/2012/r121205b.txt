Stefan Ingves: Monetary policy entails a balancing act 
Speech by Mr Stefan Ingves, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Basel 
Committee  on  Banking  Supervision,  to  the  Norrland  County  Administrative  Board,  Luleå, 
4 December 2012. 
 Today I would like to take up some aspects of the difficult balancing act that monetary policy 
has  to  perform  and  that  in  many  respects  reflect  the  lessons  we  have  learned  from  the 
financial and debt crisis.  
The global economy has suffered a number of turbulent years. More than four years have 
now  passed  since  the  outbreak  of  the  global  financial  crisis.  Unfortunately,  the  recovery 
following this crisis came to a halt when the financial crisis developed into a debt crisis in 
Europe. 
The Swedish economy has coped rather well with the crisis so far. We have of course been 
affected by the unease abroad and by the economic downturn, but to a much lesser extent 
than many other countries. This is due to factors such as stable public finances and good 
competitiveness.  Another  reason  why  Sweden  has  coped  so  well  is  that  we  have  not 
suffered  a  crash  on  the  housing  market.  However,  household  indebtedness  is  very  high, 
which makes the households more vulnerable to a fall in housing prices and other risks. The 
course of events in several countries during the financial and debt crisis shows that we must 
take risks of this type seriously. 
As growth prospects have weakened we have cut the repo rate over the last 12 months in 
order to attain the inflation target and support economic activity. However, a lower repo rate 
also  increases  the  risk  associated  with  household  indebtedness.  The  decisions  to  cut  the 
repo-rate have therefore not been self-evident. 
Low repo rate in Sweden over the last 12 months  
In connection with the financial crisis the repo rate was lowered all the way to 0.25 per cent, 
where it remained for almost a year - from mid-2009 to mid-2010. During the strong recovery 
that followed the financial crisis we moved towards a normalisation of monetary policy, and 
during  the  autumn  of  2011  the  repo  rate  reached  2  per  cent.  However,  the  financial  crisis 
then became a debt crisis in Europe, which has undermined economic prospects once again. 
We  therefore  had  to  call  a  halt  to  the  normalisation  process.  This  year,  the  Riksbank  has 
instead  cut  the  repo  rate  in  a  number  of  stages  to  stimulate  the  Swedish  economy  and 
prevent the rate of inflation becoming too low. Historically speaking, the repo rate is now very 
low (see Figure 1). 
Let me now go back a little and describe how we ended up in the position we are now in with 
regard  to  monetary  policy.  I  also  intend  to  take  up  some  of  the  important  lessons  learned 
from the international financial and debt crisis of recent years. 
The financial crisis became a debt crisis in Europe…  
The  global  financial  crisis  began  about  four  years  ago.  The  origins  of  the  crisis  lay  in 
problems  on  the  US  housing  market,  but  after  the  bankruptcy  of  Lehman  Brothers  in 
September 2008 the situation developed into a global financial crisis. GDP in the world as a 
whole fell for the first time since the 1940s (see Figure 2). There was also a dramatic fall in 
global trade (see Figure 3). This was then followed by a couple of years in which the global 
economy began to recover, and global trade increased (see Figure 3). 
However, it did not take long for clouds to gather on the horizon again. Problems with major 
budget deficits and sovereign debts became apparent in several countries in the euro area, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

primarily in Greece, but also in Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal (see Figure 4). In Europe, 
the  financial  crisis  was  followed  by  a  debt  crisis.  However,  the  reasons  why  the  various 
countries were hit by problems were not always the same. 
In Greece, for example, public finances were far too weak at the outset to cope with such a 
severe downturn as that brought about by the financial crisis. But countries like Ireland and 
Spain  also  suffered  serious  problems,  despite  their  relatively  strong  public  finances  at  the 
outset. How could this happen? 
The problems on the US housing market originally triggered the global financial crisis. But 
problems also arose on the housing markets in several other countries, such as Spain and 
Ireland  (see  Figure  5).  Public  finances  were  hit  hard  when  the  banking  sector  had  to  be 
rescued in the wake of a bursting housing bubble, in which housing prices and bank lending 
had chased each other’s tails to form an unsustainable spiral. This was why these countries 
quickly encountered major problems in managing the growth of their sovereign debts, despite 
their relatively good position at the outset. 
An excessive build-up of debt – irrespective of whether it takes place in the private or the 
public sector  –  leads  to  problems  sooner  or  later.  Events  in  the  euro area  in  recent  years 
provide a frightening illustration of this. 
It is clear that the euro area is facing major challenges, not only for individual countries but 
for the EMU as a whole. The ECB, the EU and the IMF have implemented a range of support 
measures  to  come  to  terms  with  the  acute  problems.  A  number  of  new  decisions  and 
measures have also been announced within the EMU over the course of the year. However, 
it is important to point out that responsibility for managing these problems primarily lies with 
the  politicians  in  the  respective  countries.  Decisions  are  required  at  the  national  level,  not 
only to resolve the problem of weak public finances but also to improve competitiveness (see 
Figure 6). 
As the problems have worsened the recovery that began after the financial crisis in 2008 has 
ground to a halt, and our assessment in the Monetary Policy Report published in October is 
that GDP will actually fall in the euro area in 2012.  
…which is having a major impact on the Swedish economy 
Sweden  is  what  we  usually  call  a  small,  open  economy.  We  are  highly  affected  by 
developments  abroad.  This  high  dependence  on  economic  activity  abroad  has  led  to 
considerable  fluctuations  in  production  in  recent  years.  The  fall  in  GDP  in  2009  was  the 
largest since World War II, but growth in 2010 was the highest for 40 years. The recent weak 
development  of  economic  activity  in  the  euro  area  has  once  again  dampened  growth 
prospects in Sweden.  
An important explanation of why the Swedish economy is affected so much by what happens 
abroad is that we are highly dependent on the demand for the goods and services that we 
export  to  other  countries.  The  euro  area  is  our  largest  export  market  and  problems  in  the 
euro area therefore have a major impact on the demand for Swedish exports. One way for 
Swedish export companies to reduce this impact is to turn to new markets instead, but this is 
a very slow process (see Figure 7). The euro area will continue to be easily the largest export 
market for Sweden for the foreseeable future.  
Uncertainty  abroad  affects  households  and  companies  in  Sweden.  One  way  of  illustrating 
this  is  to  look  at  the  Economic  Tendency  Survey  of  the  National  Institute  of  Economic 
Research,  which  shows  the  households’  and  companies’  aggregated  expectations  for  the 
period immediately ahead. All in all, this survey has been at a low level throughout the year, 
which indicates that Swedish companies and households are now less confident about the 
future (see Figure 8).

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
The Swedish economy has coped relatively well…  
Over the last 12 months, growth in Sweden has thus been much more subdued than during 
the  strong  recovery  in  2010  and  early  2011.  Sweden  has  nevertheless  withstood  the 
problems abroad relatively well, and the Swedish economy continued to grow at a good rate 
during the first six months of this year.1 This is partly because the development of domestic 
demand has been relatively stable.  
There are several reasons why Sweden has coped so well. Sweden’s stable public finances, 
for example, have meant that fiscal-policy consolidation, which has otherwise dominated the 
economic-policy  agenda  in  several  other  countries,  has  not  been  necessary  in  Sweden. 
Competitiveness has also developed well. This can be seen very clearly if we look again at 
Figure 6. There are also a number of explanations for this positive development. We have 
had  a  period  in  which  productivity  grew  very  strongly  in  Sweden  for  several  consecutive 
years,  inflation  has  been  low  and  stable  and  pay  formation  has  improved  significantly 
compared with the period prior to the introduction of the inflation target. 
The  fact  that  the  Swedish  economy  has  been  strong  has  also  led  to  a  resilient  Swedish 
labour  market,  and  the  number  of  those  employed  has  continued  to  increase  somewhat 
during  the  year.  However,  the  supply  of  labour  has  also  increased,  so  that  the  fall  in 
unemployment  we  have  seen  since  the  start  of  2010  was  interrupted  at  the  end  of  2011. 
Unemployment in Sweden is now just below 8 per cent per cent (see Figure 9). 
…but high household indebtedness constitutes a risk 
Another reason why the Swedish economy has coped so well is that we have not suffered a 
crash  on  the  housing  market  or  in  other  areas  of  the  financial  sector.  Nevertheless, 
developments  in  Sweden  have  given  cause  for  concern.  Housing  prices  have  risen 
significantly  in  Sweden  over  the  last  15  years  in  both  an  international  and  historical 
perspective (see Figure 5). The same applies to household indebtedness (see Figure 6). It is 
not surprising that there is a link between these factors as a large proportion of the banks’ 
lending  to  households  has  been  used  to  buy  housing.  I  and  several  of  my  previous 
colleagues  on  the  Executive  Board  warned  about  the  risks  associated  with  household 
indebtedness and housing prices in Sweden long before the financial crisis. One could say 
that the crisis has given these issues renewed and increased currency.  
A  positive  factor  is  that  the  rate  of  increase  in  lending  to  households  has  slowed  down 
recently  following  the  very  high  rates  of  increase  we  saw  in  the  years  before  the  financial 
crisis. Housing prices have also levelled out recently. Both monetary policy and the mortgage 
cap have probably played a role in subduing lending to households.2  
However, the debt ratio, that is debt as a percentage of disposable income, is still very high 
and higher than in many of the countries that have had problems in recent years as a result 
of substantial falls in housing prices (see Figure 12). A high level of household indebtedness 
can  have  serious  consequences.  When  the  households  have  large  debts  they  become 
vulnerable. For example, a substantial fall in housing prices could give rise to extensive debt 
consolidation on the part of the households, which would risk leading to weak consumption 
                                                 
1   Since  the  monetary  policy  decision  in  October,  we  have  also  received  the  National  Accounts  for  the  third 
quarter.  These  figures  show  that  growth  declined  somewhat,  approximately  in  line  with  our  assessment  in 
October. 
2   The mortgage cap was introduced as a general recommendation from Finansinspektionen in the autumn of 
2010. In simple terms, it imposes a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 85 per cent when purchasing housing.

demand  and  high  unemployment.  Ultimately  of  course  this  would  also  lead  to  the  risk  of 
higher loan losses at the banks and risks to financial stability.3  
It is true that the households’ total assets exceed their debts by a broad margin. However, 
these assets are largely illiquid, which means that they would be hard to convert into cash if 
the households needed to reduce their debts quickly (see Figure 13).  
Few other tools are in place – monetary policy has its part to play 
We can also examine the issue of indebtedness more generally by reviewing the history of 
stabilisation  policy  in  Sweden.  During  the  period  with  a  fixed  exchange  rate  prior  to  1992, 
when responsibility for stabilisation policy lay with fiscal policy, it was not considered that the 
sovereign debt imposed any limitations on fiscal policy. This eventually led to the sovereign 
debt becoming unsustainable, and we had to reform the framework for public finances. We 
gradually  managed  to  put  public  finances  into  much  better  shape  and  to  achieve  a  falling 
tend in the sovereign debt as a percentage of GDP (see Figure 4). After the fixed exchange 
rate  regime  was  abandoned  in  November  1992,  we  also  needed  new  rules  for  monetary 
policy. The inflation target was the solution adopted. Inflation has been low and stable since 
the  mid-1990s  and  the  expectations  of  the  public  and  the  market  participants  have  been 
anchored  around  the  target  of  two  per  cent  (see  Figure  11).  We  can  thus  claim  that  the 
current framework for stabilisation policy has enabled us to gain control over the sovereign 
debt and inflation. However, there is no natural limitation of the indebtedness of the private 
sector and this becomes a particularly important issue when the repo rate is low. 
This  has  led  to  major  problems  on  two  previous  occasions.  In  the  1990s,  there  was  an 
excessive expansion of credit and many loans were used to fund the purchase of commercial 
properties.  More  recently,  we  imported  problems  via  the  banks’  excessive  lending  in  the 
Baltic countries. Today I am talking most about household indebtedness, but the issue is a 
general one. We need to focus more than previously on debts and the stock of debts in our 
analysis apparatus. 
More  specifically-targeted  tools  are possibly  more  effective  than  the  repo  rate  to  deal  with 
household indebtedness, for example amortisation requirements and higher risk weights for 
mortgages. Higher risk weights for mortgages mean that the banks must hold more capital 
for their mortgages. This is something that the Riksbank has pointed out earlier on a number 
of occasions and that we analyse in more detail in our latest Financial Stability Report. The 
issue has also been discussed by the council for cooperation on macroprudential policy set 
up jointly by Finansinspektionen and the Riksbank. Finansinspektionen recently proposed a 
floor of 15 per cent for risk weights for mortgages in Sweden.4  
However, of the conceivable concrete measures for preventing risks on the housing market 
in  Sweden,  the  mortgage  cap  is  practically  the  only  one  in  place  today.5  Unfortunately 
experience,  including  the  experience  gained  during  the  Swedish  crisis  of  the  1990s,  has 
shown that it can be difficult to reach practical decisions on measures to promote financial 
stability.  
                                                 
3   Another  factor  that  we  have  highlighted  in  our  inquiry  into  risks  on  the  housing  market  and  in  our  stability 
reports is the banks’ mortgage funding, which to an increasing extent comes from foreign investors. The banks 
are  dependent  on  the  confidence  of  these  investors  in  the  Swedish  housing  market  for  their  funding. 
Historically,  foreign  investors  have  been  “volatile”  in  times  of  market  unease.  A  fall  in  housing  prices  in 
Sweden could therefore constitute a funding risk for the Swedish banks. 
4   See  “The  economy  will  benefit  from  stricter  requirements  on  banks”,  Finansinspektionen  press  release, 
26 November. 
5   Finansinspektionen’s  proposal  on  risk  weights  for  mortgages  has  now  been  circulated  to  the  authorities 
concerned for comment and the Riksbank will present its comments at a later date.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
A point that I have made in many different contexts is worth repeating: the less others do, the 
more  monetary  policy  has  to  do.  As  you  know,  the  Riksbank  has  two  objectives  for  its 
operations:  “a  safe  and  efficient  payment  system”,  which  we  usually  interpret  as  financial 
stability, and “price stability”, which the Riksbank has formulated as an inflation target of two 
per cent. I believe that one of the most important lessons of the financial crisis is that these 
two objectives are interlinked. Financial stability is a precondition for monetary policy being 
able to work as intended, while monetary policy can affect financial stability. It is therefore 
rather natural to take the risk of financial imbalances into account in monetary policy.  
However,  there  must  be  a  reasonable  connection  between  alternative  regulations  and 
monetary policy. Regulations can be described as an indirectly-targeted means of raising or 
lowering interest rates in a certain social sector. If the regulations deviate significantly from 
the  monetary  policy  that  is  being  conducted,  distortions  and  contradictory  messages  will 
arise  after  a  while  in  the  financial  sector.  New  control  problems  will  emerge,  for  example 
through the appearance of shadow banks or through excessive borrowing abroad. As is so 
often the case, it is a question of finding the right balance. 
A low repo rate is justified, but how low? 
The economic situation over the last 12 months, that is the weak development of economic 
activity abroad and the low inflationary pressures, has made it necessary to gradually lower 
the  repo  rate  in  order  to  enable  inflation  to  rise  towards  the  target  of  2  per  cent  and  to 
normalise resource utilisation (see Figure 1).  
This means that we have a very low repo rate today, which is also reflected in lower interest 
rates  for  households  and  companies  (see  Figure  10).  Determining  how  low  the  repo  rate 
should  be  entails  balancing  many  different  factors  against  each  other.  As  I  said  earlier,  I 
believe that we must take the risks associated with financial imbalances into account in our 
monetary policy decisions as the level of household indebtedness is so high. 
Why not lower the repo rate more when unemployment is high? 
One of the arguments put forward for further repo-rate cuts is that unemployment is high (see 
Figure  14).  I  have  a  lot  of  understanding  for  this  argument.  So  why  not  cut  the  repo  rate 
more? Here I would like to point out once again that we have lowered the repo rate and the 
repo-rate  path  several  times  over  the  last  12  months,  partly  with  particular  reference  to 
unemployment. However, our analysis shows that the relatively high rate of unemployment 
also  reflects  structural  problems.  For  example,  there  are  signs  that  the  matching  of 
job-seekers with job vacancies has deteriorated in recent years, which makes it difficult to 
reduce  unemployment.  Figure  15  clearly  shows  that  while  the  number  of  unemployed  in 
non-vulnerable  groups  has  fallen  in  recent  years,  the  number  of  unemployed  in  the  more 
vulnerable  groups  has  instead  increased.6  This  illustrates  the  matching  problems  on  the 
Swedish labour market. 
But even while focusing on unemployment, monetary policy must take a long-term view and 
strive to avoid problems further ahead. A low repo rate may provide short-term gains, but “if 
we go too far down that road” problems will be waiting for us, including problems regarding 
unemployment. Figure 16 shows the development of unemployment in a number of countries 
that  have  been  hit  by  major  adjustments  on  the  housing  market.  Many  factors  have 
contributed  to  these  adjustments,  but  access  to  cheap  loans  during  the  upturn  is  one  of 
                                                 
6   According to the Swedish Public Employment Service, there are four groups who have a relatively vulnerable 
position on the labour market and who find it difficult to get a new job if they become unemployed: those born 
outside Europe, people with less than upper-secondary school education, people in the age group 55–64 and 
people with a physical disability which reduces their capacity to work.

them. There are thus risks associated with setting the repo rate too low and this applies not 
least  to  unemployment,  although  perhaps  beyond  the  rather  short  economic  horizon  that 
normally attracts almost all the attention.  
An appropriate balance 
I have now provided some background to some aspects of the difficult balancing act that we 
must  perform  when  determining  monetary  policy.  Let  me  conclude  by  illustrating  this  with 
reference  to  our  latest  monetary  policy  decision  and  our  latest  forecast  for  the  repo  rate. 
Here  we  have  achieved  what  I  believe  is  an  appropriate  balance.  The  weaker  economic 
prospects and the low inflationary pressures justify keeping the repo rate low. This will help 
inflation  to  rise  towards  the  target  of  2  per  cent  and  to  strengthen  economic  activity  (see 
Figure 17). However, we also need to take into account the risks associated with household 
indebtedness  in  our  repo  rate  decisions.  Our  balancing  act  in  October  resulted  in  an 
unchanged  repo  rate,  but  a  downward  adjustment  of  the  forecast  for  the  repo  rate  (see 
Figure 18). Such a monetary policy means that we can, on the one hand, attain the inflation 
target  and  stabilise  employment  in  the  long  term  and,  on  the  other  hand,  take  the  risks 
associated  with  financial  imbalances  into  account.  However,  monetary  policy  alone  cannot 
eliminate the risks associated with household indebtedness that I have discussed today. It is 
important  to  have  a  wide-ranging  discussion  among  several  authorities  in  Sweden  on  the 
need for additional measures.
