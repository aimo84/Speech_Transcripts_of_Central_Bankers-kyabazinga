Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy 
Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Osaka 
Haruhiko Kuroda 
Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
Introduction 
It is my great pleasure to have the opportunity today to exchange views with a distinguished 
gathering of business leaders in the Kansai region. I  would like to take this opportunity to 
express my sincerest gratitude for your cooperation with the various activities of the Bank 
of Japan's branches in Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto. 
 In my speech today, I would like to first explain the Bank's view on the recent developments 
in  economic  activity  and  prices,  and  then  talk  about  its  thinking  behind  the  conduct  of 
monetary policy. 
 I. Economic Developments 
Let me start by talking about developments in Japan's economy. The economy is expanding 
moderately,  and  the  real  GDP  growth  rate  for  the  April-June  quarter  registered  a  firm 
increase of 2.5 percent on an annualized basis. It is the first time in eleven years, since 2006, 
that it has continued to mark positive growth for six consecutive quarters (Chart 1). Looking 
ahead,  the  economy  is  likely  to  continue  its  moderate  expansion.  Some  of  the  recent 
characteristics of the economic expansion are as follows. 
 The  first  feature  is  that  the  economic  growth  has  been  led  by  both  external  and  domestic 
demand in a well-balanced manner.  Looking at overseas economies, business sentiment in 
the  manufacturing  sector  has  been  on  an  improving  trend  in  both  the  advanced  and  the 
emerging  economies,  and  the  world  trade  volume  has  been  recovering.  Under  such 
circumstances,  Japan's  exports  have  been  on  an  increasing  trend,  such  as  those  of 
automobile-related and capital goods (Chart 2). Regarding domestic demand, business fixed 
investment has been on a moderate increasing trend as corporate profits have been at record 
high  levels.  Private  consumption  has  increased  its  resilience  recently  against  the 
background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation. Furthermore, 
as  the effects  of  the  government's  large-scale  stimulus  measures  formulated  last  year  have 
been  emerging  lately,  public  investment  has  been  increasing  (Chart  3).  The  economy  has 
been expanding, not on the basis of a single factor, but rather supported by multiple factors 
-- namely, external demand, domestic private demand, and domestic public demand -- in a 
 1 
well-balanced manner. For this reason, the economic expansion can be expected to sustain 
itself going forward. 
 The second feature of the recent economic expansion is that its effects have been spreading 
to a wide range of economic entities. The differences in the degree of improvement in the 
diffusion index (DI) for business conditions either by firm size or by region are not as large 
as those during the recovery phase in the mid-2000s before the global financial crisis (Chart 
4). The DI for the Kinki region had been below the national average from 2015 toward 2016, 
but  has  been  improving  rapidly  since  the  second  half  of  2016,  reflecting  a  remarkable 
recovery  in  overseas  economies.  Looking  at  the  employment  and  income  situation,  the 
current  economic  expansion  has  benefitted  a  wide  range  of  households.  The  year-on-year 
rate of increase in hourly wages of part-time employees, which are particularly sensitive to 
the tightening of the labor market, has registered about 2.5 percent. This is higher than that 
of  full-time  employees,  implying  that  the  difference  in  wage  levels  between  part-time and 
full-time employees has become smaller. There have been many cases where those who had 
worked as part-timers but wanted to become employed as full-timers have been able to do 
so. Moreover, the active job openings-to-applicants ratio of full-time employees exceeded 1 
in June for the first time since the statistics started to be compiled in 2004 (Chart 5). As just 
described,  the  economic  expansion  has  been  benefitting  both  full-time  and  part-time 
employees. In the labor market as a whole, the unemployment rate has declined to around 3 
percent,  which 
is  equivalent 
to  virtually  full  employment,  and 
the  active 
job 
openings-to-applicants ratio stands at 1.52, exceeding the highest  figure during the bubble 
period and reaching a level last seen as far back as in 1974 (Chart 6). 
 Triggered in part by the tightening of labor market conditions, it has become another feature 
of  Japan's  economy  of  late  that  a  wide  range  of  firms  and  industries  have  been  taking 
measures  to  raise  labor  productivity.  Since  wage  increases  resulting  from  labor  shortage 
mean rises in labor costs for firms, many  firms  have been making various efforts to avoid 
passing on a rise in labor costs directly to their customers. A typical example is labor-saving 
and  efficiency-improving  investment  with  the  use  of  information  technology.  In  fact,  in 
labor-intensive  sectors  such  as  retailing  as  well  as  accommodations,  eating  and  drinking 
services,  software  investment  has  increased  to  a  remarkable  degree  recently  (Chart  7). 
 2 
Furthermore,  firms  have  been  streamlining  their  business  processes.  For  instance,  some 
supermarkets and chain restaurants have discontinued services late at night and early in the 
morning,  at  which  time  the  number  of  customers  is  relatively  small, and  instead allocated 
their  limited employees  to  daytime  services. Even  with  reduced  labor  input due  to  shorter 
business hours, sales will not decrease so much, thereby lifting firms' labor productivity. 
 Of  these  measures,  increasing  labor-saving  and  efficiency-improving  investment  has 
certainly contributed to the recent growth in business fixed investment. In addition, from a 
longer-term  perspective,  firms'  various  efforts  are  expected  to  play  an  important  role  in 
raising  Japan's  growth  potential.  In  Japan,  it  is  essential  to  raise  labor  productivity  to 
compensate for the decline in labor force. Although this is not easy, firms' increasing efforts 
of  various  kinds  amid  the  widespread  labor  shortage  of  late  have  become  a  driving  force 
toward raising productivity, which is a long-standing challenge to Japan's economy. 
 II. Price Developments 
Now I will move to  price developments. The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer 
price index (CPI) excluding fresh food has increased to around 0.5 percent recently, but that 
which  also  excludes  the  effects  of  a  rise  in  energy  prices  has  been  relatively  weak, 
remaining at around 0 percent (Chart 8). Looking ahead, the Bank of Japan projects that the 
rate of change in the CPI is likely to continue on an uptrend and increase toward 2 percent. 
In  what  follows,  let  me  describe  how  this  process  will  operate,  especially  from  firms' 
standpoint. 
 What lies behind the fact that inflation has been relatively weak despite the increase in labor 
costs  is  firms'  efforts  to  absorb  the  costs  that  I  mentioned  earlier.  Specifically,  many 
Japanese  firms  have  raised  wages  for  their  employees  but  kept  the  prices  of  products  and 
services  unchanged,  through  labor-saving  investment  and  streamlining  of  their  business 
processes, for example. It often is pointed out that one reason why firms do not raise their 
sales prices is a kind of caution that, if they raise their prices but competitors do not, they 
may  lose  customers  and  competitiveness  in  the  market.  Given  that  their  competitors  have 
the  same  thought,  perhaps  all  the  competing  firms  wait  and  see  what  others  will  do  and 
none  make  the  first  move.  This  strategy  itself  would  be  reasonable  for  firms  facing  stiff 
 3 
competition. At the same time, however, it also makes it unlikely that firms will raise their 
sales prices by passing on increased costs to those prices as necessary. 
 What  will  happen  going  forward?  Given  that  firms  have  already  been  working  on 
streamlining  their  business  processes  in  many  ways,  it  will  gradually  become  difficult  for 
them to continue to absorb increases in  wage costs through those measures. In addition to 
continuing efforts to streamline their business processes, firms will need to reflect in their 
sales prices the increased costs that they cannot absorb. Lately, it also seems to be becoming 
more likely that competitors will follow suit when a firm moves toward increasing its prices. 
This  is  because  it  is  highly  likely  that,  facing  a tight  labor  market, every  firm  feels  that it 
has been reaching the limit to which it can absorb increasing labor costs. On the consumer 
side, their perception of price rises seems to be changing gradually, as the employment and 
income  situation  has  improved  due  to  the  better  labor  market  conditions.  After  one  of  the 
major transportation companies announced this spring that it planned to raise the prices of 
its  delivery  services,  competitors  followed  suit.  According  to  a  news  report,  slightly  more 
than 30 percent of firms in the restaurant business are planning to raise the prices on their 
menus  within  this  fiscal  year,  mainly  due  to  increases  in  labor  costs.  These  developments 
appear to show the possibility that firms' price-setting stance has been changing in response 
to the tightening of the labor market and improvement in the economy. 
 These kinds of changes in firms' price-setting stance have not yet become widespread in the 
entire  economy.  However,  as  firms'  and  consumers'  stance  on  the  passing  on  of  costs 
changes  with  the  economy  continuing  to  expand  moderately,  firms' attempts  to  raise  sales 
prices  will  likely  gradually  become  more  widespread  across  a  broad  range  of  industries. 
Furthermore, as this process lifts actual prices, firms' and households' medium- to long-term 
inflation expectations, or people's perception of future inflation, will increase. The Bank of 
Japan  projects  that,  through  these  mechanisms,  the  inflation  rate  is  likely  to  increase 
gradually toward the price stability target of 2 percent. 
 III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy 
Next,  I  will  elaborate  on  the  Bank's  thinking  behind  the  conduct  of  monetary  policy.  As 
stipulated  in  the  Bank  of  Japan  Act,  the  objective  of  the  Bank's  monetary  policy  is 
 4 
"achieving  price  stability,  thereby  contributing  to  the  sound  development  of  the  national 
economy." The specific number representing "price stability" is "2 percent" in terms of the 
year-on-year rate of change in the CPI.   
 For reasons why this needs to be 2 percent, I will explain three points in sequence: a bias in 
price statistics, securing policy room for the future, and a global standard. 
 Let  me  start  with  a  bias  in  price  statistics.  Although  I  am  not  going  into  detail  since  this 
might be a bit technical, the inflation rate based on the CPI that the Bank refers to tends to 
be  higher  than  actual  inflation.  Given  this,  aiming  at  zero  inflation  in  terms  of  the  CPI 
means aiming at negative inflation, in effect. Therefore, in order to ensure price stability, the 
inflation rate should be sufficiently positive. 
 The  next  point  regards  securing  policy  room  for  the  future.  The  level  of  nominal  interest 
rates is usually determined in accordance with that of inflation rates. Looking at the interest 
rate levels around 2007, right before the global financial crisis, whereas the policy interest 
rates in the United States and Europe were around 4 to 5 percent with inflation of around 2 
percent, the policy interest rate in Japan, or the uncollateralized overnight call rate, was only 
0.5  percent  with  almost  zero  inflation  (Chart  9).  In  response  to  the  global  financial  crisis, 
which exerted a significantly negative impact on the global economy, the United States and 
Europe counteracted this shock with monetary easing  that pushed down the policy interest 
rates by 4 to 5 percentage points to around 0 percent. On that occasion, although Japan also 
reduced the policy interest rate to around 0 percent, as the United States and Europe did, it 
was  only  able  to  exert  limited  monetary  easing  effects  of  0.5  percentage  point.  As  you 
remember, the real GDP in Japan dropped more significantly than that in Europe and in the 
United States, the epicenter of the crisis. This implies the possibility that the fact that Japan 
had less room for policy responses in lowering interest rates became a contributing factor to 
the  severer  downturn  of  the  economy.  With  the  level  of  nominal  interest  rates  being  high, 
Japan's  economy  will  have  more  policy  room  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  future  economic 
downturns, or will be equipped with a sort of insurance for sustained economic growth. 
  5 
So  far, I have mentioned a bias in price statistics and securing policy room  for  the  future, 
but these alone do not give a good enough reason why the target level of inflation has to be 
2  percent.  There  are  some  proposals  advocated  overseas  that  the  target  level  of  inflation 
should be 3 to 4 percent in order to further increase policy room, although these proposals 
themselves do not seem realistic. So, why is 2 percent considered most appropriate? 
 To answer this question, the third reason, a global standard, is key. Central banks in major 
economies  are  currently  conducting  monetary  policy  with  the  aim  of  achieving  around  2 
percent inflation. Given this, the Bank of Japan's monetary policy conduct with the aim of 
achieving 2 percent inflation is also likely to contribute to stable foreign exchange rates in 
the  long  run.  Foreign  exchange  rates  fluctuate  due  to  various  factors  in  the  short  run,  but 
they are considered to reflect inflation differentials between at home and abroad in the long 
run. From the long-run perspective, if the inflation rate at home remains stable at around the 
same  level  as  those  in  other  major  economies,  stability  in  foreign  exchange  rates 
consequently will be ensured. 
 For the preceding three reasons, the Bank sets the price stability target of 2 percent in terms 
of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI. However, some may feel uncomfortable about 
aiming at a positive inflation rate of 2 percent. For example, in the Bank's Opinion Survey 
on the General Public's Views and Behavior, a questionnaire survey of individuals, about 80 
percent of respondents answered that price rises are rather unfavorable.   
 I would like to emphasize that what the Bank aims at in the conduct of monetary policy is 
not simply an increase in inflation. It aims to achieve an economy with a virtuous cycle in 
which  the  incomes  of  people  increase  firmly  as  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent  in 
terms  of  the  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI  is  achieved.  The  historical  data  show 
that  consumer  prices  and  wages  have  generally  been  moving  in  parallel.  In  Japan  in  the 
1980s and in the United States, with positive inflation, nominal wages generally increased 
at  a  higher  pace  than  the  CPI  (Chart  10).  Given  that  developments  in  actual  prices  are 
factored in at annual spring labor-management wage negotiations, the parallel relationship 
between inflation and wage growth is easy to understand. In such an economic environment, 
nominal  interest  rates  usually  will  increase  as  well.  Since  interest  rates  are  the  rates  of 
 6 
return  on  investment  for  each  economic  activity  within  the  economy  as  a  whole,  they  are 
expected to converge to the level consistent with the nominal growth rate of the country in 
the  medium  to  long  run.  In  an  economy  with  economic  expansion  and  steady  positive 
inflation,  both  nominal  wages  and  nominal  interest  rates  increase,  which  means  that  the 
incomes  of  wage  and  salary  earners,  and  of  those  who  are  living  off  their  deposits,  will 
increase. 
 I would like to underscore the fact that the Bank, through achieving the price stability target 
of  2  percent,  is  aiming  at  realizing  a  well-balanced  economy  in  which  people's  incomes 
increase accordingly. 
 Conclusion 
Lastly, I would like to conclude my speech by briefly explaining the Bank's recent conduct 
of monetary policy. 
 The  Bank  has  been  implementing  powerful  monetary  easing  under  "Quantitative  and 
Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control," aiming to achieve the price 
stability target of 2 percent. This policy framework was introduced exactly a year ago, and 
at  this  meeting  with  you  last  year,  I  talked  about  the  new  policy,  which  had  just  been 
introduced. 
 "QQE  with  Yield  Curve  Control"  consists  of  two  components.  The  first  is  an 
inflation-overshooting  commitment,  in  which  the  Bank  commits  itself  to  expanding  the 
monetary  base  until  the  year-on-year  rate  of  increase  in  the  actual  CPI  exceeds  2  percent 
and stays above that level in a stable manner. The second component is yield curve control, 
in  which  the  Bank  controls  short-  and  long-term  interest  rates  under  the  guideline  for 
market operations decided at every Monetary Policy Meeting. Looking back at the one year 
since its introduction, Japan's long-term interest rate has been stable at around zero percent, 
which  is  the  target  level,  and  bank  lending  rates  as  well  as  issuance  rates  for  corporate 
bonds have been at extremely low levels. Moreover, financial institutions' lending attitudes 
as  perceived  by  firms  have  remained  positive  both  for  large  and  small  firms,  and  the 
year-on-year  rate  of  increase  in  the  amount  outstanding  of  bank  lending  has  been  in  the 
 7 
range of 3.0-3.5 percent recently. Such highly accommodative financial conditions, as well 
as  proactive  initiatives  by  financial  institutions,  have  been  firmly  supporting  corporate 
activities in Japan. 
 Although there is still a long way to go to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, the 
Bank  will  continue  to  persistently  pursue  powerful  monetary  easing  with  a  view  to 
achieving the target at the earliest possible time. 
 Thank you.
