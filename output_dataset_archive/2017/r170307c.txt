Recent Economic and Financial Developments 
and Monetary Policy in Japan 
Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Tokushima 
Takehiro Sato 
Member of the Policy Board 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
Introduction 
Thank you for giving me this opportunity to exchange views with people representing the 
political,  economic,  and  financial  communities  of  Tokushima  Prefecture.  I  would  like  to 
take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude for your cooperation with the activities 
of the Bank of Japan's Takamatsu Branch and Tokushima Office.   
 
In today's speech, I will begin by focusing on recent economic and financial developments 
in Japan and abroad, as well as the Bank's recent monetary policy. I will then touch briefly 
on the economy of Tokushima Prefecture. Following my speech, I would like to hear your 
views  on  actual  conditions  in  the  local  economy  and  on  the  Bank's  conduct  of  monetary 
policy. 
 I. Recent Economic and Financial Developments in Japan and Abroad 
A. Global Financial Markets and Overseas Economies 
In 2016, the results of the U.K.'s referendum and the U.S. presidential election turned out to 
be  different  from  the  expectations  of  most  market  participants,  leading  to  volatile 
movements  in  global  financial  markets.  In  particular,  after  the  U.S.  presidential  election, 
stock  prices  in  major  countries  soared  partly  due  to  expectations  for  fiscal  stimulus 
measures.   
 
Recently, the market exuberance has calmed amid cautiousness about protectionist moves. 
However, some of the exuberance remains, with U.S. stock prices staying at a record high 
level. 
 On the monetary policy front, in a situation where some people assume that the slack in the 
U.S.  labor  market  has  been  considerably  reduced  or  eliminated,  the  Federal  Reserve  has 
become more active in sending messages since the December FOMC meeting, indicating 
the possibility of accelerating the pace of interest rate hikes, depending on the contents of 
fiscal policy, because of concern about the economy overheating due to fiscal expansion. 
 
Under these circumstances, among future risk factors is a change in the flow of funds in 
global  financial  markets  driven  by  U.S.  monetary  policy,  above  all  the  possibility  of  an 
 1 
outflow  of  funds  from  emerging  economies.  The  huge  pile  of  debts  that  accumulated  in 
emerging economies during U.S. monetary easing in the past is a chronic disease that takes 
time to be remedied, so to speak, although it is not attracting much attention for the moment. 
Meanwhile, although China is heading toward stable growth led by the appearance of the 
effects  of  various  economic  measures,  it  is  necessary  to  continue  to  pay  attention  to 
structural problems, including the problem of excessive domestic debts. Also, the political 
situation,  especially  in  Europe,  is  another  major  risk  factor  for  2017,  considering  that  it 
disturbed global financial markets in 2016. 
 B. Japan's Economy 
Japan's  economy  was  in  a  soft  patch  until  around  the  first  half  of  2016,  reflecting  the 
turmoil in global financial markets and the slowdown in emerging economies in that period. 
However, the economy turned up through the end of the year in line with the pick-up in 
emerging economies. Exports are picking up, led mainly by mobile phone parts and other 
IT-related goods as well as automobile-related goods including parts, while production is 
also improving in line with the progress in inventory adjustments. Consumption lacks vigor 
despite somewhat increasing its resilience recently. However, going forward, consumption 
is expected to continue increasing moderately because household and business sentiment is 
generally picking up against the background of the solid employment and income situation 
and because stock prices have stayed firm. If the effects of fiscal stimulus measures under 
the recent supplementary budget are taken into consideration, Japan's economy is expected 
to maintain the growth pace of around 1.5 percent in fiscal 2017, as it did in fiscal 2016. 
 
Although there are many points to discuss concerning Japan's economy, here, I would like 
to  focus  on  the  relationship  between  the  recent  employment  situation  and  wages  in 
connection  with  the  price  situation,  which  will  be  discussed  later.  Across  Japan,  labor 
shortage is becoming serious and the employment situation is becoming increasingly tight. 
However, the tight employment situation in local regions is presumed to be partly due to 
demographic  effects.  For  example,  the  active  job  openings-to-applicants  ratio  before  the 
2000s  varied  significantly  by  region  in  times  of  favorable  economic  conditions,  with 
well-performing regions recording a steep rise in the ratio, while the ratio remained low in 
regions  where  the  employment  situation  remained  sluggish.  In  contrast,  in  the  current 
 2
economic phase, the variance between well-performing and other regions has become small, 
as  the  ratio  is  also  rising  in  regions  where  it  was  low.  In  2016,  the  active  job 
openings-to-applicants ratio surpassed 1.0 in all 47 prefectures for the first time. The rise in 
the ratio in local regions is presumed to be due in part to a decline in the number of job 
applicants caused by population migration, so it seems not quite right to simply interpret the 
rise as a result of improvements in the economic situation. 
 
Looking  at  the  active  job  openings-to-applicants  ratio  by  job  type,  we  can  see  that  the 
degree of the tightness of the employment situation varies significantly. For example, the 
ratio was over 3.0 for nursing care-related workers and construction workers, whereas the 
ratio  was  in  the  range  of  only  0.3-0.4  for  general  clerical  workers.  The  ratio  is  low, 
particularly  for  regular  workers  engaging  in  clerical  jobs.  In  other  words,  the  labor 
supply-demand  balance  is  tightening  with  respect  to  nursing  care-related  workers  --  for 
which  wages  are  kept  low  as  a  policy  and  which  are  chronically  in  short  supply  -- 
construction workers with special skills, and truck drivers in the transportation industry, but 
there continues to be excess labor with respect to clerical jobs. 
 
Although there are variances by industry, hourly wages of non-regular workers increased by 
about 2 percent compared with the previous year, reflecting the tight employment situation, 
whereas basic wages of regular workers do not rise easily, reflecting the sense of excess 
labor.  As  wages  and  employee  income  of  non-regular  workers  are  lower  than  those  for 
regular workers, the rise in wages of non-regular workers is insufficient to raise the overall 
hourly wages and employee income at the macro level, given the composition effects. There 
is a broad consensus on the view that this is one reason why prices do not rise easily, as is 
mentioned below. 
 
If business managers view that there is a surplus of labor with respect to regular workers 
engaging in clerical jobs or if wages not commensurate with the productivity level are being 
paid, it must be said that the hurdle for raising basic wages of regular workers, which are 
fixed costs for firms, is high. 
 
 3
This is a matter related to the situation of the labor market itself, which I will discuss later, 
and  I  believe  that  it  is  necessary  to  quickly  forge  a  consensus  among  various  quarters 
concerning this matter. 
 C. Prices 
The consumer price index (CPI, on a nationwide basis, all items less fresh food and energy) 
for December 2016 remained relatively weak, with the year-on-year rate of change marking 
0.1 percent, remaining close to 0 percent. The main reason for the weakness is considered to 
be  because  households'  preference  for  lower  prices  and  their  cost-saving  tendency  grew 
again as people's sentiment became cautious due to the market turmoil in the first half of 
2016, putting a drag on consumption, and because firms' price-setting behavior accordingly 
grew cautious.   
 
Recently,  as  people's  sentiment  improved  due  to  a  recovery  in  the  market  environment, 
consumption  has  somewhat  increased  its  resilience.  The  underlying  trend  in  prices  is 
presumed to sensitively reflect the consumption trend, so I am looking forward to a change 
in  the  underlying  trend  in  prices,  which  has  remained  weak  since  2016,  in  the 
January-March  quarter  of  2017  at  the  earliest.  The  year-on-year  increase  in  the  CPI 
including  energy  (all  items  less  fresh  food)  is  expected  to  pick  up  further  in  line  with 
developments in the underlying trend in prices, as the negative contribution of energy prices 
is likely to dissipate in the January-March quarter and gradually rise to positive territory. It 
is possible to expect the year-on-year growth rate to surpass 1 percent in the second half of 
fiscal  2017,  although  that  depends  on  the  assumptions  of  crude  oil  prices  and  exchange 
rates.   
 
For the moment, market participants' outlook for prices does not appear to be so bullish. 
However, if the year-on-year rate of growth in the CPI rises faster than the consensus pace, 
the  long-term  interest  rate,  which  has  stayed  close  to  0  percent  due  to  the  Bank's 
Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, may face 
increased upward pressure, so I would like to carefully monitor these developments. 
 
 4
As  a  result  of  our  experiences  in  the  four  years  since  the  introduction  of  QQE,  we  have 
learned that if people's medium- to long-term inflation expectations decline under prolonged 
deflation, it is not easy to raise them again even through unconventional monetary policy 
implemented on a large scale. As was pointed out in the Bank's comprehensive assessment 
of  QQE  released  in  September  2016,  the  formation  of  people's  medium-  to  long-term 
inflation  expectations  in  Japan  is  considered  to  be  strongly  influenced  by  the  past  CPI 
growth rates -- in other words, the formation of inflation expectations is largely adaptive.   
 
If  people's  price  perceptions  become  conservative,  the  frequency  of  price  adjustments 
declines,  and  in  particular,  services  prices,  represented  by  administrative  prices,  become 
sticky. The reason why a vicious circle of low services prices leading to a curb on wages at 
service  providers  occurs  is  presumed  to  be  that  people's  medium-  to  long-term  inflation 
expectations,  namely  the  norm  applied  to  prices,  become  excessively  conservative  and 
difficult to change.   
 
One necessary condition for raising inflation expectations after they have declined due to 
the adaptive expectations formation in an environment of sticky prices is that the observed 
CPI rises to some degree due to a shock either on the supply side or on the demand side. 
The  recent  pick-up  in  energy  prices  is  likely  to  have  the  effect  of  raising  inflation 
expectations somewhat in a situation where a change in the underlying trend in prices is 
expected.  However,  it  cannot  be  denied  that  inflation  expectations  are  influenced  by  the 
external environment at the time. 
 
More fundamentally, I believe that it is desirable to change the wage-setting mechanism in 
the labor market and shift to a forward-looking expectations formation mechanism like the 
one observed in the United States and Europe. In other words, in wage negotiations, it is 
desirable to replace the existing practice of referring to the observed CPI in the past with a 
method of sharing between labor and management the outlook on the path of price changes 
over the next several years, or over the medium to long term, and to use the central bank's 
price target as the basis of the medium- to long-term path of price changes. To do so, it is 
necessary  for  people  to  have  sufficient  confidence  in  the  central  bank's  price  target  and 
monetary policy.

II. Future Conduct of Monetary Policy 
A. QQE with Yield Curve Control 
I have been arguing that it is necessary to make patient efforts in the medium to long term 
in  order  to  raise  people's  dampened  medium-  to  long-term  inflation  expectations  and 
overcome deflation, and that to this end, it was essential to transform the framework of the 
previous QQE, which was a shock therapy solution aiming for quick results, into a more 
flexible  and  sustainable  one.  QQE  with  Yield  Curve  Control,  which  was  adopted  in 
September  2016  after  the  comprehensive  assessment,  is  in  line  with  my  argument,  so  I 
agree with this framework in principle. Even so, the current guideline for market operations 
-- to set the short-term policy interest rate of minus 0.1 percent and the target level of yields 
on 10-year Japanese government bonds (JGBs) at around 0 percent -- could lead to holding 
JGB yields in negative territory up to a maturity of ten years. In particular, there is a high 
probability  that  yields  on  bonds  in  the  short-  and medium-term  zones  with a  maturity  of 
three to five years will stay in negative territory under the current guideline. I have been 
voting  against  setting  interest  rate  target  levels  because  such  a  situation  is  unlikely  to 
contribute  to  maintaining  financial  system  stability,  which  is  one  of  the  Bank's  two 
mandates. 
 
However,  unlike  the  pegging  of  long-term  interest  rates  that  was  adopted  in  the  United 
States until the 1950s, the framework of QQE with Yield Curve Control is a flexible one 
under which, at each Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM), the target level for the intermeeting 
period is determined. Under this framework, regarding the control of the long-term interest 
rate, the Bank's Policy Board judges what the appropriate shape of the yield curve is while 
taking into consideration economic activity, prices, and financial conditions at the time and 
the momentum of changes in the situation. However, regarding the appropriate shape of the 
yield curve, there is large room for interpretation in the range of the optimal policy interest 
rate level calculated even through the Taylor rule; currently, there is as much or more room 
for interpretation. Therefore, even the most advanced economics theories cannot precisely 
identify  the  shape  of  a  yield  curve  at  which  economic  activity  neither  accelerates  nor 
decelerates.  In  addition,  as  the  policy  practice  concerning  the  control  of  the  long-term 
interest rate is not necessarily well-established at this moment, I believe that it is important 
to  take  due  care,  for  example  by  avoiding  surprises  to  the  market  through  close 
 6
communication before conducting market operations although the timing and degree of the 
control is of course a matter to be decided by the Policy Board. 
 
Under the above-mentioned thinking, my view on the policy reaction function concerning 
the  control  of  the  long-term  interest  rate  is  as  follows:  if  the  Policy  Board  assesses  that 
economic  activity  and  prices  are  changing  for  the  better  and  that  market  conditions  are 
changing in response to or in anticipation of the improvement, it is appropriate to flexibly 
adjust  the  interest  rate  level  in  the  guideline  so  that  the  guideline  would  reflect  market 
movements.  For  example,  if  this  policy  works  well,  resulting  in  higher  inflation 
expectations,  it  is  natural  to  think  that  nominal  interest  rates  will  come  under  upward 
pressure  because  of  awareness  about  inflation  risk  premiums.  In  that  case,  from  my 
viewpoint, it is uncertain whether the Bank can continue to keep nominal interest rates at 
around 0 percent through conventional JGB purchases. Even if the Bank can do so, such 
operation  would  be  undesirable  because  it  could  build  up  financial  imbalances  when  the 
rates  are  kept  there  for  too  long.  Furthermore,  although  unrestricted  fixed-rate  purchases 
may  be  effective  in  controlling  the  market  in  the  short  term,  I  am  concerned  that  the 
implementation of this sort of operation could undermine dialogue with market participants 
by  constraining  subsequent  policy  management  because  such  purchases  will  send  quite  a 
strong message of commitment by the central bank to a specific interest rate level. In this 
respect, I understand that fixed-rate purchases are nothing more than an emergency tool. I 
believe  that  flexibly  and  moderately  adjusting  the  targets  in  accordance  with  market 
conditions is prudent policy management even if this approach may be considered behind 
the curve. 
 
In  my  view,  the  yield  curve  that  would  be  most  appropriate  for  achieving  favorable 
conditions  in  economic  activity  and  prices  should  be  a  little  steeper.  If  the  yield  curve 
becomes  excessively  flat  and  expectations  of  a  continued  interest  rate  decline  become 
predominant, firms and households increasingly tend to defer procurement of funds, which 
in turn leads to postponement of investment and consumption -- in other words, demand is 
prone to be deferred. In this respect, a slightly steeper yield curve is rather beneficial for 
stimulating  sound  economic  activity  and  is  also  likely  to  contribute  to  enhancing  the 
sustainability of the social security system, thereby stabilizing people's sentiment. As for the 
 7
negative impact of steepening, I presume that it barely dampens business fixed investment 
at the macro level because economic entities other than the government that procure funds 
in the very long term -- a period of 20 to 30 years -- are limited to firms whose cash flow is 
abundant and stable from the outset. 
 B. A Shift from Targeting the Monetary Base to Targeting Interest Rates 
One of the key points of the policy shift from QQE with a Negative Interest Rate to QQE 
with Yield Curve Control is that the operating target for money market operations changed 
from the monetary base to interest rates, a traditional target. In this respect, the guideline for 
the  Bank's  annual  JGB  purchases  of  about  80  trillion  yen,  which  was  the  pillar  of  the 
initiative  to  increase  its monetary  base,  has  become  an  approximate  guideline  that  is  not 
strongly  binding  for  the  guideline  for  money  market  operations.  Consequently,  I  believe 
that  the  purchasing  of  treasury  discount  bills,  which  has  been  conducted  as  a 
complementary measure in preparation for the possibility of failing to reach the monetary 
base target through purchases of JGBs, is essentially unnecessary. I consider it desirable to 
further reduce the amount outstanding of holdings of treasury discount bills while paying 
close attention to the impact on the money market.   
 
Even so, it is necessary to continue purchasing a certain amount of JGBs as a precondition 
for long-term interest rate control regardless of whether or not the annual purchase amount 
should be about 80 trillion yen. As for the impact of continued purchases of JGBs on the 
long-term interest rate, it is natural to think that the long-term interest rate will come under 
downward pressure due to the stock effects as JGBs are accumulated on the central bank's 
asset side. Theoretically, it is impossible to set targets in terms of quantity and interest rates 
at the same time, and the actual policy framework is not intended to do so. Therefore, if the 
long-term interest rate target of around 0 percent is maintained for a certain period of time, 
it is also natural to think that the purchase amount of JGBs will gradually decrease. 
 
In  that  case,  the  relationship  between  the  decrease  and  the  approximate  guideline  for 
purchasing JGBs totaling about 80 trillion yen per year may become an issue. However, I 
believe  that  monetary  policy  should  not  be  bound  by  that  figure,  which  is  merely  an 
approximate guideline. The prospect that the JGB purchase amount necessary and sufficient 
 8
to  keep  the  long-term interest  rate at  around  0  percent  will  gradually  start to  decrease in 
theory  could  become  an  important  factor  that  will  promote  smooth  normalization  of 
monetary policy if we are to consider in the relatively long term what the ideal exit from the 
unconventional monetary policy should be like after deflation is overcome. 
 C. Relationship with Fiscal and Structural Policies 
Since  the  recognition  of  the  need  to  utilize  all  available  measures,  including  not  only 
monetary  but  also  fiscal  policy  measures,  was  shared  at  the  Group  of  Twenty  (G-20) 
meeting in Shanghai in February 2016, the roles of expansionary fiscal policy and monetary 
policy  supporting  it  have  been  discussed  in  various  quarters.  "Helicopter  money,"  which 
calls for fiscal expansion using permanent fiscal finance provided by the central bank, is an 
extreme example.  In  addition,  the  Fiscal  Theory  of  the  Price  Level  (FTPL),  which  has a 
more robust theoretical framework, has regained attention in Japan since the Jackson Hole 
conference in August 2016.   
 
The definition of helicopter money differs depending on who is discussing it. In Japan, the 
central  bank  is  prohibited  from  engaging  in  direct  financing  of  fiscal  deficits  in  the  first 
place.  Meanwhile,  the  underwriting  of  zero-coupon  perpetual  government  bonds  by  the 
central  bank,  which  is  often  mentioned  by  supporters  of  helicopter  money,  is  unrealistic 
even if legal problems are resolved, because the idea of capitalizing something that has no 
or little economic value is not practical. 
 
Concerning the FTPL, even if government debts are assumed to be financed in the future by 
inflation  that  will  be  triggered  by  fiscal  expansion,  it is  difficult to  use  it  as  the  basis  of 
macroeconomic forecasts for the purpose of policy formulation because empirical research 
on this topic is still insufficient. While economic policy is implemented based on a critical 
decision  that  takes  account  of  more  than  just  economic  gains  and  losses  for  various 
economic entities, it is difficult to obtain the consent of stakeholders based on an economic 
model which considers future inflation to be inevitable but cannot predict when it will occur. 
Actual  policy  management  cannot  help  being  prudent  because  macroeconomic  policy  is 
managed under various constraints -- constraints in terms of legal, accounting, and practical 
 9
affairs, as well as the need for parliamentary consent -- and because policy authorities need 
to be strongly conscious of these constraints. 
 
Because  of  the  limitations  of  the  unconventional  monetary  policy,  fiscal  expansion  is 
refocused  in  the  political  and  academic  worlds.  My  understanding  is  that  this  situation 
occurred  because  in  Japan's  case,  it  has  been  difficult  to  feel  the  benefits  of  economic 
recovery  despite  powerful  monetary  easing  measures  implemented  on  an  unprecedented 
scale. In Europe's case, this was a reaction to the excessive rise in expectations for monetary 
policy  after  awareness  about  the  limitations  of  fiscal  policy  grew  due  mainly  to  the 
sovereign debt crisis. In particular, the fact that the global financial crisis that broke out in 
2008 was overcome through various unconventional measures has led to misunderstanding 
that  monetary  policy  is  the  "only  game  in  town."  In  that  respect,  the  recent  spread  of 
expectations for fiscal measures reminds me of this lesson: "History repeats itself." 
 
In any case, I feel sympathy with the fact that an orthodox strategy of strengthening growth 
potential through structural policy while buying time by providing cyclical support for the 
economy  through  collaboration  of  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  has  started  to  gain  some 
support not only in Japan but globally, because the strategy has something in common with 
the concept of the "three-arrows" strategy that was launched soon after the inauguration of 
the Abe administration. 
 
Under  these  circumstances,  the  central  bank's  role is  ultimately  generating  the  maximum 
effects  of  the  fiscal  and  structural  policies  by  maintaining  accommodative  financial 
conditions. Within the scope of this role, the Bank is conducting unprecedented monetary 
policy, namely, controlling the yield curve. The prerequisite for the control of the long-term 
interest rate is that the credibility of the JGB market is maintained through the government's 
efforts  toward  establishing  a  sustainable  fiscal  structure.  If  fiscal  discipline weakens  as a 
result of the Bank guiding the long-term interest rate to around 0 percent, it is possible that 
the credibility of fiscal management will be undermined and that the Bank will inevitably 
increase JGB purchases further in order to control the long-term interest rate. In addition, if 
the long-term interest rate rises due to a decline in the credibility of fiscal management, it is 
uncertain whether an increase in risk premiums can be contained through the Bank's JGB 
 10
purchases. In this situation, I believe that it is necessary to keep in mind the risk that this 
policy could lead to fiscal dominance, depending on the fiscal policy stance. 
 
While a substantial portion of newly issued JGBs are purchased by the Bank, I would like to 
reiterate that the JGB purchases are conducted from the perspective of overcoming deflation 
and achieving the price stability target, not for the purpose of financing fiscal deficits.   
 Concluding Remarks: Economic Activity in Tokushima Prefecture 
My concluding remarks will touch on the economy of Tokushima Prefecture. 
 
Tokushima  Prefecture,  facing  the  Seto  Inland  Sea and  the  Pacific  Ocean,  is  blessed  with 
rich  natural  resources, including  mountains,  which  occupy  around  80  percent  of  its  land, 
small  and  large  rivers,  including  Yoshino  River,  and  the  Naruto  whirlpools,  as  well  as 
historical and cultural heritage items, including the Awa dance and the Shikoku 88 Temples. 
Looking at the industrial structure of this prefecture, which prospered in the past thanks to 
its aizome (indigo dye) industry and salt industry, we see that the manufacturing industry, 
mainly chemicals and electrical machinery, has a particularly large share. In addition, the 
share  of  the  primary  industry  is  relatively  large  compared  with  the  national  average.  In 
agriculture, Tokushima Prefecture has the largest share of production in Japan concerning 
many items because of its geographical advantage -- proximity to the cities of Kyoto, Osaka, 
and Kobe. It is also rich in tourism resources. The annual Awa dance festival held in August 
is a major summer festival in Japan that attracts more than 1 million people. 
 
Tokushima  Prefecture's  economy  has  recently  continued  to  recover  at  a  moderate  pace. 
Although growth momentum in business fixed investment has come to a pause, investment 
has stayed at a relatively high level. Private consumption has continued to pick up, while 
housing investment is also picking up, albeit with fluctuations, and is at a high level. Public 
investment  has  been  more  or  less  flat.  Production  is  moderately  picking  up  albeit  with 
fluctuations and has stayed at a high level.   
 
However,  Tokushima  Prefecture  is also  facing  challenges  of  a  population  decline and  an 
aging society. In this situation, the following has gained attention: the presence of satellite 
 11
offices  of  IT  firms  taking  advantage  of  the  prefecture's  superior  broadband  environment, 
which  is  one  of  the  best  in  Japan;  initiatives  as  seen  in  "Happa  Business,"  which  is  led 
mainly by elderly people; and renewal of communities using the scenic views of unexplored 
sites and traditional Japanese-style houses. Moreover, Tokushima Prefecture as a whole has 
recently  been  conducting  initiatives  bolder  than  before,  including  the  "Vs.  Tokyo 
'Comeback  to  Tokushima'  Comprehensive  Strategy,"  which  has  been  formulated  by  the 
local  government.  In  relation  to  the  manufacturing  industry,  Tokushima  Prefecture  has 
continued to actively invite and support LED-relating firms, with the number of such firms 
operating  in  the  prefecture  already  exceeding  100.  Regarding  urban  area  revitalization 
initiatives, Tokushima Marche is held every month as an event to sell unique agricultural 
products and processed products, attracting many visitors. Also, I hear that the Tokushima 
LED  Art  Festival,  which  was  held  in  December  2016,  was  successful,  drawing  more 
visitors  than  at  the  previous  time.  In  terms  of  tourism,  the  Otsuka  Museum  of  Art  and 
Iya-no Kazura Bashi suspension bridge are attracting an increasing number of tourists from 
outside the prefecture, including foreign tourists.   
 
I hope that these wide-ranging initiatives will bring successful results and further invigorate 
the economy of Tokushima Prefecture.
