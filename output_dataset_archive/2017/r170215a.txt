A Next Growth Model for Asian Economy: 
Beyond "the Workshop of the World" 
Speech at 2017 Northeast Asia International Conference   
for Economic Development in Niigata 
Haruhiko  Kuroda 
Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
Introduction 
Thank you very much for inviting me to the Northeast Asia International Conference for 
Economic  Development.  I  am  honored  to  have  the  opportunity  to  speak  to  all  the 
participants  who  have  long  devoted  themselves  to  economic  revitalization  in  Asian 
countries.  I  would  like  to  extend  my  heartfelt  gratitude  to  Representative  Director  Dr. 
Masahiro Kawai for giving me this valuable opportunity. 
 
In  1993,  when  the  Economic  Research  Institute  for  Northeast  Asia  was  established,  the 
world began to search for a new global landscape after the end of the Cold War. I think it 
was much to the point the reason for the establishment of this institute which focused on 
Northeast Asia, where former Eastern and Western bloc countries neighbor each other, and 
which attempted to develop together in a new partnership. Since 1993, as a result of the 
cooperation  among  northeast  Asian  countries,  Asia  has  developed  and  become  "the 
workshop of the world," leading the global economy. 
 
However,  the  Asian  growth  model  as  "the  workshop  of  the  world"  may  have  reached  a 
turning point. The growth rate of the Asian economy has slowed since the global financial 
crisis  of  the  late  2000s.  The  global  trade  slowdown  works  as  a  headwind  to  the 
export-driven growth in Asian countries. The side effects of globalization have also been 
widely discussed.   
 
Today, I will express my thoughts about the Asian economy at this turning point from the 
medium- and long-term perspective. First of all, I will briefly look back on the development 
of  the  Asian  economy  and  review  how  it  has  enjoyed  growth  as  "the  workshop  of  the 
world" over the course of building global value chains (GVCs) after the Cold War. Then, I 
will point out that this growth model is stumbling at the moment. Finally, I will explain that, 
in  establishing  a  next  growth  model  for  Asian  economy,  it  is  important  to  improve  the 
productivity of the service sector as the next driver of growth. 
 
I. Current State of the Asian Economy 
Let me start with the current state of the Asian economy. Chart 1 shows the growth rate of 
real  GDP  for  nine  Asian  countries  excluding  Japan.  The  Asian  economy  had  grown  at 
 1 
approximately 8 percent per year on average until the middle of the 2000s except for 1998, 
when the currency crisis hit the economy. However, the growth rate has slowed since the 
late 2000s and dropped to about 6 percent in 2015. Comparing it with the growth rate of 
other  regions  after  the  late  2000s,  the  degree  of  slowdown  in  the  Asian  economy  is  the 
second largest after that of the Middle East economy, which faced the drop of oil prices and 
political destabilization. This fact indicates that the slowdown of Asian growth is noticeable 
even from the global perspective. 
 
The decline in the growth rate has brought about a slowdown in the progress toward a high 
income country in many Asian countries. Chart 2 shows per capita gross national income 
(GNI) which is one of the barometers of economic development. The World Bank defines 
those  countries  with  GNI  of  more  than  about  12,000  U.S.  dollars  as  "high  income 
countries." At present, many Asian countries are still below this level, in the middle income 
group. 
 
According to research by the World Bank, among 101 middle income countries in 1960, 
only  13  became  high  income  ones,  and  the  rest  remain  at  the  middle  income  level  even 
today, i.e., more than 50 years later.1  This situation, where a country cannot get out of the 
middle income level, is called the "middle income trap." Some economies in Asia, such as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, and Korea, escaped this trap and joined the "high income country 
club."  These  economies  took  about  20  years  on  average  to  graduate  from  being  middle 
income  countries.  Many Asian  countries  stay  at  a  middle  income  level  for  more  than  20 
years, raising concerns that they may have fallen into the middle income trap. 
 
Next, I will talk about how the Asian economy made its fortune as "the workshop of the 
world," in order to explore the reasons why the growth rate has recently slowed. 
 
II. Economic Growth as "the Workshop of the World" 
Economic Globalization 
Let  me  review  the  historic  transition  of  "the  workshop  of  the  world"  in  the  waves  of

economic globalization to see the current standpoint of Asia. 
 
The term "the workshop of the world" was originally used to refer to the United Kingdom 
in the 19th century, which had overwhelmed the world with its industrial power. Then, at 
the beginning of the 20th century, people began to call the United States "the workshop of 
the world," rather than the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom and the United States, as 
"the  workshops  of  the  world,"  had  accomplished  innovative  developments  such  as steam 
engines  and  the  telephone,  and  had  created  mass  production  systems  by  constructing 
modern factories based on these developments. They also established a manufacturing trade 
in which they imported materials from all over the world and exported industrial products. 
The volume of global trade increased as free trade was promoted by "the workshop of the 
world."  Today,  though  the  term  "globalization"  is  widely  used  in  a  variety  of  fields, 
economic globalization had its origins in the 19th century. 
 
Richard Baldwin, a professor of economics at the University of Geneva, points out that in 
the period of globalization led by the United Kingdom and the United States, people started 
to trade goods all over the world because the cost of trade had declined due to innovation, 
and wealth had concentrated in "the workshop of the world."2  From the 1970s to the end of 
the 1980s, Japan and Germany caught up with them, took over the role of "the workshops of 
the world," and accumulated wealth rapidly. 
 
GVCs and the Economic Growth of Asia 
A new era of globalization started at the end of the 1980s as the Cold War ended. Foreign 
direct investment increased globally mainly due to the large capital inflows into the former 
Eastern  bloc  countries  such  as  China  and  those  in  the  former  Soviet  Union  and  in  East 
Europe.  Also,  the  establishment  of  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  in  1995 
strengthened the institutional framework of free trade. Over this period, many multinational 
companies,  which  already  had  hubs  in  various  regions,  evolved  their  production  systems 
even more. They segmented the process, from planning and development of products to the 
production  of  parts,  assembly,  and  sales.  They  optimally  decentralized  locations  for  the 
production  process  and  services  all  over  the  world  by  seeking  economics  of  scale  and

Globalization, The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

comparative  advantage.  By  the  middle  of  the  2000s  they  had  constructed  a  network  of 
international specialization in a finely meshed pattern, which is called GVCs. 
 
The development of IT greatly contributed to the establishment of GVCs. This is because IT 
enables firms to collectively manage and control a large number of geographically dispersed 
processes.  Professor  Baldwin,  whom  I  mentioned  earlier,  notes  that  the  lower  cost  of 
information processing due to the development of IT since the 1980s had made it easy to 
share  information  between  developed  and  emerging  countries,  and  had  therefore  fostered 
the rapid growth of emerging countries. As a result, the share of emerging countries in the 
world GDP increased while that of G7 countries declined to around 50 percent in the latter 
half of the 2000s from two-thirds in 1990. 
 
The volume of global trade has increased greatly due to the formulation of GVCs. Chart 3 
shows the global trade volume relative to the world real GDP. It basically continued to be 
flat during the 1980s, which means the growth rate of the global trade volume had been 
almost the same as that of the economy. However, it has soared since the 1990s, and the 
global trade volume increased faster than real GDP. Multinational companies demand and 
supply a wide variety of goods internationally to produce final goods under GVCs. So the 
growth  rate  of  the  trade  volume  is  higher  than  that  of  the  demand  for  final  products. 
Moreover,  they  constructed  production  bases  in  various  regions  of  the  world  in  forming 
GVCs.  Therefore,  the  increase  in  the  trade  of  capital  goods,  such  as  machine  tools  and 
construction  machines,  also  contributed  to  the  increase  in  trade  volume.  You  might  have 
noticed that, in Chart 3, global trade volume kinked after the global financial crisis in the 
late 2000s and became flat again. We will come back to this point later. 
 
Asia is the heart of GVCs and, as you know, China has come to be called "the workshop of 
the world." Multinational firms established the production system, where China is the final 
place for assembling a product, and the surrounding Asian countries supply capital goods 
and  parts.  They  chose Asia  as  a  manufacturing  base  because they  can  mass-produce  and 
export products at low cost due to the inexpensive and abundant labor force and industrial 
sites. Also, they expected Asia to become a prospective market of consumer goods, because 
of  its  large  population.  Another  reason,  I  think,  is  that  governments  in  Asia  eased 
 4 
restrictions  on  foreign  investment  in  the  manufacturing  sector  in  order  to  attract  direct 
investment. 
 
So how did the GVCs affect economic growth in Asia? Firms in developed countries have 
arranged  development  and  production  bases  through  GVCs  by  seeking  the  efficiency  of 
each process to reduce production costs and increase value added. Hence, Asian countries 
became the production bases of GVCs induced by foreign direct investment, and acquired 
high  technology  and  know-how.  On  this  point,  they  are  different  from  the  cases  of  the 
United  Kingdom  and  the  United  States,  which  used  to  be  "the  workshops  of  the  world." 
While  production  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  United  States  was  based  on  their  own 
innovations, Asia, which specializes in the production process, enhanced their technology 
by  introducing  the  technologies  of  developed  countries.  This  means  that  they  acquired 
technologies  embedded  in  imported  capital  goods  and  intermediate  goods,  and  shared 
technologies and knowledge through IT from the firms in developed economies. 
 
Asian  countries  raised  their  income  level  by  increasing  exports  based  on  the  increased 
investment and innovations related to the GVCs after the Cold War ended. Consequently, 
people in Asia became middle-income consumers and domestic consumption expanded. The 
increase in the income level and domestic consumption changed Asia into not just a place 
for production but also a final destination for consumption goods, to which major global 
companies pay attention. This was the growth pattern of Asian economy after the end of the 
Cold War. 
 
Global Trade Slowdown 
The Asian growth model based on GVCs seems to have stumbled after the global financial 
crisis of 2008. One of the main reasons is that the growth of trade has slowed down globally. 
I mentioned earlier that the global trade volume in the chart kinked after the late 2000s and 
became flat again. The global trade volume had increased faster than the growth rate of the 
global economy before the financial crisis, but that has not been the case since the crisis. 
 
This  may  be  attributable  to  the  slowdown  of  global  GDP  growth.  This  means  that  the 
growth rate of demand for the final goods slows down and growth of the demand for parts 
 5 
of  the  final  goods  slows  down  accordingly.  Consequently,  the  growth  of  trade  slows 
synergistically. I said earlier that trade volume growth is likely to be higher than economic 
growth  under  GVCs,  but  it  is  conceivable  that  the  opposite  happened  after  the  financial 
crisis. If that was the case, global trade will pick up again as the growth rate of the global 
economy increases. Nevertheless, it is not likely that global trade will resume the high pace 
of growth enjoyed before the financial crisis. This is because structural factors other than 
cyclical factors are likely to have contributed to the slowdown of global trade. 
 
The first structural factor is that the  expansion of GVCs has likely paused. Major global 
companies  had  mostly  finished  building  up  GVCs  and  development  of  frontiers  with  an 
even  cheaper  and  more  abundant  labor  force  and  a  prospective  market  of  consumption 
goods by the middle of  the 2000s. So the related trade may have been subdued. Chart 4 
shows  the  contribution  of  each  region  and  each  category  of  goods  to  the  slowdown.  A 
darker shadow shows a larger contribution to the total slowdown. The decline in the growth 
of capital and intermediate goods in China and the NIEs-ASEAN economies is noticeable. 
This is consistent with the argument that most global firms had built GVCs by the middle of 
the 2000s. 
 
The second structural factor behind the global trade slowdown is the expansion of in-house 
production in China. China, which used to not have high-end manufacturing skills, relied on 
other  countries  for  the  supply  of  high-end  parts  and  specialized  in  assembling  them  by 
making the final goods with the inexpensive labor force. However, this situation is largely 
changing. Recently, firms in China have been able to produce sophisticated parts as their 
domestic technologies have improved. Thus, they can complete the production of some final 
goods,  from  production  of  the  parts  to  assembly  only  in  China.  Another  reason  for  the 
change is the fact that Chinese government, setting a goal of being a strong manufacturing 
country, thoroughly supports business activity through the tax system and subsidies. 
 
Owing  to  this,  the  other Asian  countries  which  have  so  far supplied  parts to  China  have 
missed their major export market, and trade volume has decreased. This is what is behind 
the decline in the import of intermediate goods in Asia. This may be a factor which requires 
countries  in  Asia  which  have  grown  thanks  to  exports  to  China  to  rethink  their  growth 
 6 
model.   
 
The third structural factor is that trade liberalization has become sluggish. For example, the 
world average tariff rate, which was 14 percent in 1990, dropped to 4 percent in 2011 but 
picked  up  to  about  5  percent  in  2013.  The  IMF  points  out  that  the  number  of  non-tariff 
barriers has been increasing since the financial crisis and protectionism is gradually rising.3 
 
III. Service Sector Expected as the Future Leading Industry 
Low Productivity of the Service Sector in Asia 
If the volume of global trade does not increase at its past high pace, Asian countries need to 
modify their economic growth model. I believe the service sector holds the key to this new 
growth model.4  This is for the following three reasons. First, the rise of per capita income 
tends to shift the demand from goods to services. The phenomenon in which an economic 
development accompanies an increase in the GDP share of the service sector is known as 
Petty-Clark's  law.  Further,  the  saving  rate  in  many  Asian  countries  is  high  because  of 
insufficient social security and other factors. If improving social security induces a decline 
in  the  savings  rate  and  an  increase  in  consumption,  demand  for  services  may  expand 
significantly. 
 
Second, the service sector plays an important role in the production of higher value-added 
export  goods  through  making  the  GVCs  more  sophisticated.  I  will  mention  later  that 
manufacturing  firms  essentially  need  to  input  services  in  order  to  produce  higher 
value-added goods and differentiate themselves from competitors.   
 
Third, the global trade volume in services still has ample room for expansion, even if the 
global trade growth in goods remains slow. 
 
Let me review the situation of the service sector in Asian countries excluding Japan. The 
left panel of Chart 5 shows the share of the tertiary sector, or service sector, in the nominal 
                                                  
3  See C. Constantinescu, A. Mattoo, and M. Ruta (2015), "The Global Trade Slowdown: Cyclical or 
Structural?," IMF Working Paper, No. 15/6. 
4  For discussion of productivity and trade in the service sector, see M. Morikawa (2016), Theory of 
Service-Intensive  Country:  Frontier  for  Activating  a  Mature  Economy,  Nikkei  Publishing  Inc. 
(available in Japanese).

GDP. Contrary to popular belief about Asian countries being manufacturing-dominated, the 
share of the tertiary sector has increased gradually to almost 50 percent in 2014. The share 
of the tertiary sector in Asian countries is smaller than that in developed countries, which 
reached  around  60  percent,  but  this  shows  that  the  Asian  industrial  structure  is  not 
extremely  biased  in  favor  of  the  manufacturing  sector.  Therefore,  it  is  evident  that 
Petty-Clark's  law  also  applies  to  Asian  countries  whose  per  capita  income  has  increased 
steadily.   
 
It  is,  however,  somewhat  concerning  that  labor  productivity  in  the  tertiary  sector  is 
significantly lower than that in the secondary sector in Asian countries. The right panel of 
Chart 5 shows the ratio of labor productivity in the tertiary sector to that in the secondary 
sector. In general, labor productivity in the manufacturing sectors tends to be higher than 
that in the service sectors due to the rapid progress of technology. In developed countries, 
the productivity in the tertiary sector is around 90 if that in the secondary industry is set 
equal to 100. However, in China and the NIEs economies such as Korea, productivity in the 
tertiary sector is around 70, and that in ASEAN countries such as Thailand and Indonesia is 
around 60. 
 
An increase in the share of the service sectors with lower productivity than manufacturing 
sectors  dampens  productivity  in  the  overall  economy,  which  brings  about  a  decline  in 
economic  growth  rate.  This  is  a  phenomenon  known  as  Baumol's  cost  disease,  in  which 
advanced countries tend to be trapped. Asian countries are probably in the same situation.   
 
GVCs and Modern Services 
I will now discuss the current situation of the service sectors in Asia in detail. The left panel 
of Chart 6 splits the share of service sector into two categories: "traditional services" and 
"modern services." Traditional services consist of daily necessary services such as the retail 
and wholesale industries and administrative services. Modern services are those services in 
demand  by  people  with  higher  income,  such  as  restaurants,  education,  financial 
intermediation,  and  medical  services.  Modern  services  are  generally  said  to  be  higher 
value-added than traditional services, although the degree of value added differs by country 
and  by  type  of  service.  Chart  6  indicates  that  the  share  of  traditional  services  in  Asian 
 8 
countries  is  almost  same  as  that  in  developed  countries.  On  the  other  hand,  the  share  of 
modern services in Asian countries is considerably lower than that in developed countries.   
 
It is considered that the lower productivity in Asia's service sectors is due to the fact that 
modern services have not yet fully expanded. The right panel of Chart 6 describes modern 
services  in  detail.  It  indicates  that  the  share  of  medical  services  and  business  services  in 
Asian countries is considerably lower than that in developed countries. It is likely that the 
lower share of medical services results from the insufficient health care system in Asia. 
 
Business  services  consist  of  any  service  accompanying  a  business  activity  such  as  legal, 
accounting, consulting, and design services. The lower share of business services in Asia is 
probably related to the development of GVCs which I mentioned earlier.   
 
The  production  process  is  not  composed  of  only  a  simple  manufacturing  process  to 
assemble  the  parts  of  a  product.  Production  of  final  goods  consists  of  not  only  a 
manufacturing  process  but  also  service  inputs  like  R&D,  design,  and  market  research, 
before the manufacturing process. Further, it needs service inputs such as advertising, sales 
promotion,  and  maintenance  after  the  manufacturing  process.  Service  inputs  before  and 
after the manufacturing process are important components in the production process.   
 
Moreover,  this  service  input  largely  determines  the  value-added  of  final  goods.  It  is 
generally  said  that  service  input,  not  the  manufacturing  process,  produces  the  largest 
amount  of  value-added  in  final  goods.  This  is  known  as  the  "smile  curve,"  that  is,  the 
relationship between the degree of value-added and production process is a U-shaped curve. 
GVCs made full use of comparative advantages by segmenting each production process. As 
a result of the development of GVCs, a service process other than a manufacturing process 
stays in developed countries, while the manufacturing process moved into Asian countries. I 
think the difference in the share of business services in modern services between developed 
and  Asian  countries  is  a  result  of  whether  the  production  process  in  each  country  has  a 
service  process  to  create  high  value-added  and  whether  business  service  sectors  have 
evolved enough to support production activities.   
 
 9 
At  the  present  time  when  there  are  many  high  value-added  goods  in  the  world,  service 
inputs  become  more  and  more  important,  and  therefore  the  so-called  "servitization  of 
manufacturing"  is  in  progress.  Asian  countries  have  realized  high  economic  growth  by 
taking on the responsibility of the world's manufacturing process as "the workshop of the 
world." However, in the service sector, Asian countries are still behind developed countries. 
The key element for the next growth of Asian countries is to promote service sectors and 
produce higher value-added goods. 
 
Required Infrastructure Improvement 
An improvement in infrastructure is essential for raising the labor productivity of service 
sectors and expanding the share of them in the Asian economy. Infrastructure means a broad 
range of infrastructures including not only tangible infrastructure, such as electric power, 
roads,  and  railroads,  but  also  intangible  infrastructure,  such  as  legal  restrictions  and 
educational systems. 
 
In countries with a higher quality of broadly-defined infrastructure, the productivity of the 
service sector tends to be higher. Chart 7 shows indices quantifying the strength of legal 
restrictions,  the  years  of  schooling,  and  the  accumulation  of  social  capital  in  Asian 
economies, with each country in order of higher labor productivity in the service sector. A 
colored cell indicates the indices inferior to developed countries, and the deeper the color is, 
the lower the degree of infrastructure improvement is. 
 
The  chart  suggests  several  points.  First,  like  developed  countries,  highly  productive 
economies such as Singapore and Hong Kong have well-developed infrastructure. On the 
other  hand,  countries  located  on  the  lower  end,  that  is  those  with  lower  productivity  in 
service  sectors,  tend  to  have  more  colored  cells,  which  indicate  that  insufficient 
infrastructure may lead to low productivity. 
 
Second, viewing each category in the chart, we can find out that such countries as Indonesia 
and  the  Philippines  have  room  for  building  more  tangible  infrastructure  such  as  roads, 
railroads, and electric power. Improving tangible infrastructure will raise the productivity of 
administrative  service  sectors,  which  directly  make  use  of  them  such  as  the  energy  and 
 10 
transportation sectors. It will also contribute to the enhancement of the productivity of the 
overall  service  sector  through  strengthening  the  function  of  metropolitan  areas  with  a 
concentrated population. 
 
Third, most Asian countries can improve intangible infrastructure, such as legal systems and 
regulations.  Regulation  on  service  sectors  is  generally  strict  because  service  industries 
include many public-oriented sectors such as energy, financial, and communication services. 
Furthermore, many countries impose restrictions on foreign investment in service sectors to 
protect domestic industries. This situation in the service sector is quite different from that in 
the manufacturing industry, for which regulations have been loosened in order to acquire 
foreign currency and create jobs. The service trade restrictiveness index made by the OECD 
on the left side of Chart 7 indicates that some Asian countries impose stricter limitations 
than those in developed countries. Other indices assess as inferior elements of infrastructure 
(i)  a  lack  of  conformity  with  a  law  or  practice,  for  example,  frequent  corruption  and 
deterioration of public order, and (ii) violation of intellectual property rights. In addition, an 
inadequate social security system such as public health care and pension may bring about 
increased uncertainty, which disturbs growth driven by domestic demand. 
 
Finally, I will touch upon some issues for education. Many Asian countries have raised the 
enrollment rate of elementary school, which is over 90 percent at present. However, in some 
Southeast Asian countries, the enrollment rate of secondary school and higher education is 
still  low,  which  results  in  fewer  years  of  schooling.  Further,  according  to  research  on 
academic ability by the OECD, the rankings of Singapore and Hong Kong are among the 
best in the world but those of some Southeast Asian countries are below the world average.5 
The  source  of  value-added  in  services  is  the  skill  of  workers  as  well  as  buildings  and 
equipment.  Improving  education  is  one  of  the  most  important  issues  for  enhancement  of 
productivity in the service sector. 
 
Conclusion 
Today  I  talked  about  the  growth  model  and  current  issues  in  the  Asian  economy  and 
presented the importance of raising productivity and competitiveness in the service sector as

one of the keys for the next growth model. 
 
Whatever the next growth model is, it is necessary for Asian economic growth to keep the 
free trade system. GVCs, which have brought about prosperity in Asia, are still an important 
growth  engine,  although  growth  in  the  volume  of  global  goods  trade  may  not  be  able  to 
recover the past high pace. The labor cost rises in Asian countries where per capita income 
increases  rapidly,  and  this  means  that  Asia  may  not  continue  to  be  the  best  place  for 
manufacturing.  In  fact,  some  firms  have  already  moved  their  production  bases  to  other 
countries in order to reduce production costs. Taking this opportunity of reorganizing GVCs, 
Asian countries should make an effort to create new comparative advantages by expanding 
investments and increasing production efficiency. The major premise of this effort is to keep 
the free trade system, which has supported the growth of the world economy to date.   
 
The role of service sectors is important for the world economy to enjoy the fruits of the free 
trade system. IT developments make it easier to trade services internationally, which results 
in the "servitization of manufacturing." Consequently, the global trade volume in services 
tends  to  expand  more  than  that  of  goods.  These  movements,  however,  are  still  led  by 
developed  countries.  The  share  of  Asian  countries  in  global  service  trade  is  less  than  20 
percent,  while  that  in  goods  reaches  around  30  percent.  Further,  in  most  Asian  countries 
including China, the trade balance in services remains in deficit. 
 
As  the  level  of  income  in  the  developing  countries  increases,  the  demand  for  services  is 
expected  to  grow.  In  addition,  services  still  have  more  room  for  trade  liberalization  than 
goods.  If  the  trade  liberalization  of  services  is  promoted,  trade  in  services  will  expand 
between  developed  and  developing  countries  or  between  the  developing  ones,  which  is 
expected to contribute to raising productivity and competitiveness in Asia.   
 
I feel encouraged by the remarkable IT development in Asia, which is the key for expansion 
of GVCs including service inputs. Shenzhen, which is known as "China's Silicon Valley," is 
a very innovative city, where many young Chinese start businesses, and where 270 of the 
world's largest firms which are listed in the Fortune Global 500 have established business 
 12 
sites,  such  as  research  and  development  centers.6  The  Philippines,  which  is  known  as  a 
global voice message service site, which includes call centers, is undertaking a large amount 
of overseas business by using its high proficiency in communicating in English. In addition, 
using its high level of digital literacy, India has expanded the business process outsourcing 
such as system development and data management. As a result, it is worth noting that both 
countries record a service trade surplus. 
 
The Asian economy has played a role as a driver of global economic growth to date. It is 
desirable that, in the future, the Asian economy will lead the global economy in a different 
way  than  before  and  ensure  progress  toward  high-income  countries.  I  hope  that  the 
Economic Research Institute for Northeast Asia contributes to further development in Asia 
through its various activities such as research, economic interchange, and this conference. 
Thank you for your attention.

Note: Based on the elasticity of real import volume to GDP during the period of 2003-2006 for each region, we extrapolate the pre-crisis
trend for the period of 2012-2014. The figures show the contributions of the deviation of the realized import growth from the pre-
crisis trend. A darker shadow indicates a lager negative contribution to the total deviation.
