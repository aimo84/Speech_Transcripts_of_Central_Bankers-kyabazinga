 Public Credit Registry (PCR) and Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN):  
Giant Strides to Democratise and Formalise Credit in India 
 By Dr. Viral V. Acharya1 
  
It  is  a  pleasure  to  be  with  you  all  and  share  with  you  my  thoughts  on  some  recent 
developments that are expected to have transformative implications for our country. In particular, 
I wish to draw your attention to some major initiatives in gathering and analysing better credit 
data that can potentially have a huge impact in creating a financially healthy India. 
 
It is a known fact that a large part of the Indian economy is informal. This year’s Economic 
  
Survey has given us an estimate, sourced in large part from the implementation of the Goods and 
Services Tax Network (GSTN). About 0.6 percent of firms – accounting for 38 percent of total 
turnover, 87 percent of exports, and 63 percent of GST2 liability – are in what might be called 
the  ‘hard  core’  formal  sector  in  the  sense  of  being  both  in  the  tax  and  social  security  net. 
Estimates also suggest that the informal economy employs nearly 50 per cent of the workforce in 
India3. The earnings of some in the informal economy may be at par with their formal economy 
counterparts, but due to its informal nature, people and businesses in this part of the economy are 
rendered  ‘invisible’  to  the  formal  banking  system.  This  ‘invisibility’  adversely  affects  their 
ability to grow current income level because of lack of access to formal credit. 
 
It  is  no  surprise,  then,  that  India's  credit-to-GDP  ratio  stands  at  a  modest  55.7  per  cent, 
  
compared to China's 208.7 per cent, United Kingdom's 170.5 per cent and United States’ 152.2 
per cent (Bank for International Settlements, Q4 2017 data, see Chart 1).4 In other words, there is 
financial under-penetration in India.

It is in this context that that I will share with you two giant strides being undertaken that 
will  help  India  move  towards  more  equitable  and  timely  access  to  credit,  especially  to  the 
underserved.  While  these  strides  are  being  undertaken  independently,  together  they  can 
democratise and formalise credit in India. 
 
Public Credit Registry (PCR) for India 
 
 
The first stride is the creation of a Public Credit Registry, or PCR in short. Last year in my 
speech5 at the Annual Statistics Day Conference in RBI, I focused on setting up a PCR in India. 
Till that time, the concept of PCR was not much discussed in our country, though a large number 
of countries had already established or were in the process of establishing PCRs. Today I am 
happy to quickly recount with you the progress that we have made in this direction thus far. The 
constitution of a High Level Task Force (HTF), under the chairmanship of Shri Y.M. Deosthalee, 
and consisting of eminent experts from various stakeholders, was announced by the RBI in Part 
B of its monetary policy statement dated October 4, 2017.  
 
  
As enunciated in its terms of reference, the HTF has a) reviewed the current availability of 
information on credit and assessed the gaps in India that could be filled by a PCR; b) studied the

best  international  practices  on  PCR  to  determine  the  scope  and  target  of  a  PCR  for  India 
including the type of information to be covered; and c) deliberated on the structure of the new 
information system or whether the existing systems could be strengthened and integrated to get a 
PCR, thereby suggesting a roadmap, including the priority areas, for developing a transparent, 
comprehensive and near-real-time PCR for India.  
 
The PCR aims to be an extensive database of credit information for all credit products in 
 
the  country,  from  point  of  origination  of  credit  to  its  termination  (repayments,  restructuring, 
default,  resolution,  etc.),  eventually  covering  all  lender-borrower  accounts  without  a  size 
threshold. As of today, information on borrowings from banks, non-banking financial companies 
(NBFCs),  corporate  bonds  or  debentures  from  the  market,  external  commercial  borrowings 
(ECBs),  foreign  currency  convertible  bonds  (FCCBs),  Masala  bonds,  and  inter-corporate 
borrowings are not available in a single data repository. The main objective of the PCR is to fill 
this lacuna and capture all the relevant information about a borrower, across different borrowing 
products,  in  one  place. Moreover,  significant  parts  of  this registry  of borrowing  contracts and 
repayment history will be accessible to all stakeholders provided they too share their data with 
the PCR. 
 
The  HTF  submitted  its  report6  on  April  04,  2018  recommending  that  a  PCR  should  be 
 
setup by the RBI in a phased and modular manner. The report of the task force has been placed 
in the public domain after the top management of the RBI discussed it and had it reviewed by its 
Legal Department. An Implementation Task Force has now taken over the job of steering the 
project.  
 
PCR – What are the gains? 
 
 
Though the HTF report has dwelt in detail on the basic questions like (a) why is a PCR 
necessary in India, followed by the closely linked question (b) what are the functions of the PCR, 
let  me  add  my  thoughts  on  the  same.  The  PCR  in  India  has  been  conceived  as  a  data 
infrastructure  that  the  financial  ecosystem  within  and  outside  the  Reserve  Bank  would  be 
drawing data from as per the PCR’s access policy. The prospective users will include lenders like 
banks and non-bank lenders including the new “fin-tech” lenders; others providing data analytics 
such as rating agencies and credit information companies; as well as regulators. 
 
 
Let  me  mention  here  the  difficulties  faced  by  the  Reserve  Bank  in  the  context  of  the 
corporate  non-performing  assets  (NPA)  problem  5-6  years  back.  In  spite  of  the  private  credit 
bureaus operating for several years and doing a vital job for retail credit scoring, the central bank

could not precisely assemble data on the quality of the credit portfolio of banks’ large borrowers 
at an aggregate level. The data are simply not being reported with integrity and full coverage in 
case  of  large  corporate  borrowers.  That  is  where  RBI’s  Central  Repository  of  Information  on 
Large Credits (CRILC), initiated in 2014, made a huge difference, even if it was somewhat late 
to be set up. CRILC provides a timely window on any degradation of credit of a large borrower 
at a bank to the central bank and to other banks having the same entity as a borrower. The Asset 
Quality  Review  (AQR)  that  followed  in  2015  relied  heavily  on  CRILC  data  to  cleanse  the 
Augean stables of massive and unrecognised non-performing assets (NPAs) that have saddled 
our banks. The credit information system, as a whole, has many such gaps which leave much 
scope for improvement. 
 
 
In my speech in July last year, I had also provided another example of how research based 
on data from credit registries can inform better policy-making. In the aftermath of the collapse of 
Lehman Brothers in September 2008, some economists – by pointing to the robust credit growth 
in bank loans – asserted that the credit flow in the United States was unaffected. But a deeper 
analysis  of  the  Thomson  Reuters  Dealscan  data  quickly  revealed  that  the  credit  growth  was 
almost entirely attributable to the corporates drawing down on the existing credit lines (a form of 
a ‘bank run’). The origination of new loans had, in fact, dried up. 
 
In  another  piece  of  research,  Lima  and  Drumond  (2015)7  discussed  the  insufficiencies 
 
attached  to  aggregate  data  when  assessing  financial  stability  and  showed  how  micro  data 
available in databases, such as Portugal’s Central Credit Register (CCR), enable an assessment 
of the causes of the movements behind the aggregates and thus uncover the potential build-up of 
imbalances  such  as  the  one  that  eventually  led  to  the  European  Sovereign  debt  crisis  and 
engulfed Portugal too. India can bring in a similar level of sophistication to its economic research 
through  careful  access  to  near-real-time  and  comprehensive  credit  data  that  a  PCR  would 
capture. 
 
World  Bank’s  Doing  Business  20188  reports  the  coverage  of  the  adult  population  by 
 
institutions  gathering  credit  data  in  select  countries,  grouped  by  the  existence  of  only  Public 
Credit Registry (PCR), only Private Credit Bureaus (PCBs), and both PCR & PCBs (Table 1). It 
is  to  be  noted  that  some  countries  have  opted  to  have  a  PCR  only  for  supervisory  purposes, 
where they cover large credits only. It is also documented that the coverage of adult population 
by PCR and PCBs varies widely depending on the objectives set by the regulators as well as the 
prevailing socio-economic condition in these countries.

At  a  broad  level,  the  PCR  increases  the  efficiency  of  lending  institutions  by  reducing 
information  asymmetry  using  a  PCR,  the  lender  can  get  a 360  degree view  of  the  borrower’s 
other  outstanding  credits  and  past  performance,  allowing  better  screening  at  time  of  credit 
origination  and  superior  monitoring  during  the  life  of  the  credit.      This  is  a  well-studied 
phenomenon  and  has  been  recorded  in  many  research  studies.  The  introduction  of  public 
registries and private bureaus has been found to raise the ratio of private credit to GDP in many 
countries by 7 to 8 percentage points over a five-year horizon9. Importantly, credit registries and 
bureaus do not just increase the amount of borrowing; they are also responsible for improving 
the quality of borrowing. 
 
India currently has a robust and unique digital identification for every citizen in the form 
of  Aadhaar.  Similarly,  the  Corporate  Identification  Number  (CIN)  as  well  as  GSTN  provide 
identities to businesses. Moreover, India is one of the few countries to provide an authentication 
service  atop  these  identity  services.  These  identities  can  be  used  in  a  PCR  to  aggregate  data 
about  borrowers  from  across  multiple  institutions  with  a  high  degree  of  confidence  in  the 
accuracy  of  merging  and  referencing  of  data.  Further,  the  PCR  will  be  a  single  source  of 
information that has veracity. It will make reporting for small financial institutions easier and 
also remove the inconsistencies that come from aggregation across different reporting formats of 
multiple financial institutions.  
 
 
With a repository of such trusted data available, banks  and other lenders will be able to 
take  better  credit  decisions.  It  can  help  them  recognize  early  warning  signs  of  asset  quality 
problems by being able to see performance on other credits. The principle of reciprocity is baked 
into  a  PCR.  While  the  lending  institutions  will  be  mandated  by  law  to  share  borrower 
information,  most  do  it  willingly,  because,  in  turn,  they  want  to  see  similar  data  from  other 
lenders before they make a credit or rollover decision. Further, lenders can compete and offer 
attractive  rates  to  borrowers  based  on  their  individual  risk  profile,  instead  of  relying  on  an 
average risk profile for all customers in a sector.

economies’, McKinsey Working Papers on Risk, No. 14.

In the Indian context, where many borrowers do not have a credit history to begin with, the 
PCR  will  enable  good  borrowers  to  distinguish  themselves.  The  envisaged  Indian  PCR  will 
mandate recording of all material events for all loans on all credit facilities (funded as well as 
non-funded) extended by all credit institutions – commercial banks, cooperative banks, NBFCs, 
MFIs  –  and  also  covering  borrowings  from  other  sources  (Chart  2).  This  will  reduce  adverse 
selection, wherein low-risk borrowers are charged higher prices, while high-risk customers pay 
lower prices on their loans, as lenders cannot adequately distinguish among borrowers.

 Let me now touch briefly upon a few key issues around the PCR on the legal front. 
Source: Report of the High-Level Task Force (HTF) on PCR for India 
 
PCR - Legal angles 
 
 
 
1.  Organization: The PCR is initially being set up within the existing RBI infrastructure. The 
Reserve Bank, being a statutory corporation, can do only those activities which are permitted by 
the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 or other legislations. In addition to its core central banking 
functions,  the  Reserve  Bank  also  performs  certain  promotional  functions.  However,  this 
 6 
promotional  activity  is  limited  to  ‘financial  institution’  only10.  Since  no  financing  activity  is 
contemplated for the proposed PCR, it might be difficult to label PCR as a ‘financial institution’. 
This takes it out of the purview of a promotion under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.  
 
 
 
Another option is to promote an organization for a matter incidental to the functions of the 
Reserve Bank11  – as part of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 or Banking Regulation Act, 
1949 or any other enactment. Collection of information, including credit information, from its 
regulated  entities  is  an  important  aspect  of  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  functions  of  the 
Reserve Bank. One can find many provisions in different enactments which enable the Reserve 
Bank  to  collect  such  information.  If  the  scope  of  collection  of  information  for  PCR  can  be 
deemed to be reasonably incidental to the expressly permitted activities of the Reserve Bank, a 
subsidiary or a Department for the purpose of setting up and hosting the PCR would be justified. 
Otherwise, the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 can be suitably amended conferring the Reserve 
Bank powers to conduct the business of PCR. Such a specific conferment of power, with clear 
enumeration  of  the  functions  of  PCR,  would  remove  the  limitations  of  incidental  powers 
mentioned above. 
 
2.  Confidentiality constraints: An important issue in connection with the setting up of PCR 
is the overriding of confidentiality provisions in many enactments, which directly or indirectly 
bar sharing of information, including credit information, except in manner specifically permitted. 
As the PCR will have to get information from different sources, the inability of the sources to 
share  such  information  can  be  a  constraint.  To  this  end,  the  PCR  will  have  a  consent-based 
architecture.  
 
The notice and choice framework to secure an individual’s consent is fundamental to data 
  
processing  practices  in  a  digital  economy.  It  is  based  on  the  act  of  an  individual  providing 
consent for certain actions pertaining to his/ her data. It is essential that users provide consent to 
an entity sharing data (the data provider) before they share data with an entity requesting access 
(the data consumer). The consent based architecture of the PCR will strengthen privacy of data 
subjects by ensuring that the data is accessible only to the data consumer, only for stipulated 
period of time and only for a stipulated purpose, as consented to by the user.  
 
PCR  Act:  Having  regard  to  the  complexities  discussed  above,  it  is  desirable  to  have  a 
3. 
special comprehensive legislation, overriding the prohibitions contained in all other legislations 
on sharing of information required for the PCR. Otherwise, all such legislations will have to be 
amended  separately,  providing  an  exemption  for  sharing  of  information  with  PCR.  It  is  to  be 
                                                       
10See: Section 17(8-AA) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. 
11See: Section 17(16) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. 
 7 
noted that almost everywhere PCRs are backed by a specific enactment of a PCR Act. In India, a 
PCR  Act can enable us transparently address the entire gamut of governance issues including 
data acquisition and its dissemination through access rights by various users. 
 
PCR – Linkages to other Datasets 
 
 
In  my  speech  in  July  last  year,  I  talked  about  how  the  power  of  information  can  be 
substantially enhanced if we can link CRILC data with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) 
database containing financial results of the corporate sector. PCR should help in connecting to 
and referencing other databases. A portion of the envisioned PCR’s power would derive from 
these linkages with ancillary information repositories. Chart 2 shows the schematics of how PCR 
proposes to augment the core credit information reported by regulated entities with linkage to 
other information sources and deliver the full potential of information to the stakeholders. For 
example, through the CIN it may connect to the company’s financial statements. It should make 
alternate  data,  like  utility  bill  payments  records,  available  for  credit  decisions.  This  can 
significantly  help  to  foster  financial  inclusion  and  democratise  credit  by  allowing  lending 
decisions to be based on all cash-flow activity of a borrower, even when physical asset creation 
has not yet taken place. 
 
Goods and Services Tax Network 
 
 
Let  me  now  turn  to  a  seemingly  unrelated  second  stride  being  undertaken  that  can  help 
directly address the information asymmetry problem in the credit market. It is one that most of 
you already know. So I don’t want to spend time explaining it, but instead focus on how it can 
move in lock-step with the PCR in completing a rich journey for formalising credit in India 
 
 
I  am  talking,  of  course,  about  the  Goods  and  Services  Tax  Network.  The  GSTN, 
ostensibly, is a way for citizens and businesses to pay their taxes, and claim their input tax credit. 
However, another way to look at the GSTN is as a trusted repository of matched invoices. Sellers 
upload their invoices to the GSTN; buyers approve the invoices billed to them. Since internal 
trade amounts to about 60 per cent of GDP, it is a dataset we cannot ignore. 
 
 
Already, the GSTN has exceeded expectations since its adoption in India. The Economic 
Survey 2018 estimates that GSTN implementation has increased the indirect taxpayer base by 
more than 50 per cent, with 3.4 million businesses coming into the tax net12. It appears that the 
number of GST registrants has risen due to a large increase in voluntary registrations. Small B2C 
firms want to be part of the GSTN because they buy from large enterprises. In fact, 68 percent of 
                                                       
12ibid

their  purchases  are  from  medium  or  large  registered  enterprises,  giving  them  a  powerful 
incentive to register, so they could secure input tax credits on these purchases. 
 
The Input Tax Credit motivation is a strong push towards digitisation and formalisation of 
small businesses. Moreover, the acceptance of invoices by the buyers creates a trusted repository 
of invoices. We know they aren’t just cooking their books; they have verified buyers at the other 
end who vouch for the invoice generated. This gives one a potentially penetrative view into the 
otherwise invisible  10  million  businesses  that  are  now  on  GSTN,  uploading  roughly  1  billion 
plus invoices every month13. 
 
Chart 3. The GST ecosystem14 
 
 Source: https://www.gstn.org/ecosystem/  
 
 
The GST ecosystem has a layer between the tax payer and the GST system (Chart 3). The 
GST Suvidha Providers (GSPs) are envisaged to provide innovative and convenient methods to 
taxpayers and other stakeholders in interacting with the GST systems. There will be two sets of 
interactions, one between the App user and GSP and the second between the GSP and the GST 
System. The GSP can help the taxpayers in GST compliance through their innovative solutions.

By design, invoicing data about their own business is made available to users of the GSTN. 
Continuing  the  theme  from  the  PCR,  we  already  know  that  trusted,  verifiable  data  from  any 
registry  can  significantly  improve  access  to  credit.  Similarly,  we  expect  an  explosion  in  the 
number of credit products specifically designed for business flow, such as invoice discounting 
based on GSTN data. 
 
The interplay of PCR and GSTN 
 
 
Now,  the  PCR  can  aggregate  the  information  of  a  borrower  using  the  core  credit 
information  repository  and  information  lying  in  a  set  of  sub-systems  spread  across  multiple 
agencies (e.g. MCA database, GSTN etc., refer to Chart 2 above), to aggregate information of a 
borrower. Together, these sub-systems create a universe of verifiable information and allow safe 
access  to  the  data  for  all  important  stakeholders  in  the  financial  system.  What  is  noteworthy 
about  these  institutions  is  that  they  are  all  digital-native.  They  have  been  designed  as  digital 
infrastructure, being able to support multiple use cases atop them, without being partial or overly 
prescriptive on any one use case. This is not happening in a vacuum. Much of this would not be 
possible  if  the  other  roadblocks  to  going  digital  weren’t  already  solved.  Other  public  digital 
infrastructure such as eKYC for knowing your customer or Unified Payments Interface (UPI) for 
digital  payments  are  nudging  users  towards  creating  larger  data  footprints,  and  helping  them 
indirectly improve their creditworthiness. 
 
 
With this infrastructure in place, we expect the costs for on-boarding those users who are 
currently excluded by formal credit to nosedive. It will become feasible to serve a large number 
of customers, operating at a much lower average transaction size. Just like in the Fast-moving 
Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector, banking and access to credit too will be ‘sachetized’ to make it 
more accessible and affordable for the masses. We want that even a small tea shop vendor should 
be able to take a 500 rupee loan at fair rates, say, for only a week, based on such data. 
 
 
researchers to monitor the health of, and provide stability to, the national financial system. 
 
Let  me  conclude.  In  a  country  with  a  low  credit  to  GDP  as  ours,  efficiently  increasing 
affordability  and  access  to  credit  are  paramount  goals.  I  am  excited  for  what  we  can  achieve 
when  our  small  entrepreneurs  are  not  capital-constrained,  or  when  health  shocks  do  not  send 
families to usurious loans, and back into poverty. The PCR and the GSTN are two giant strides
