64th Conference on Government Studies
Economic development, financial constraints and service quality:  
investments and guarantees
Public investment 
for developing the economy
Address by the Governor of the Bank of Italy 
Ignazio Visco
Varenna, 22 September 2018
In the last decade Italy’s economy experienced the most acute crisis in its history. 
The double-dip recession, during which GDP contracted by roughly nine percentage 
points, was followed by an anaemic and bumpy recovery: from 2013 to today, less 
than half of this lost ground has been recouped. Against this backdrop, there have been 
calls from many quarters for higher public spending, which can have positive effects 
on economic activity in the short term and on growth potential in the longer term.
The boost from increased spending is usually greater when this is financed 
by  a  deficit.  It  can  be  even  stronger  if  the  investments  made  are  matched  by 
private capital, increasing its returns at the margin and thereby stimulating firms’ 
investment expenditure. In the medium to long term greater growth potential comes 
from creating new opportunities for economic activity and stimulating innovation; 
both can be achieved through the completion of material infrastructure, especially 
if tech-intensive, and above all through investment in research and knowledge. 
In the short term the increase in GDP, measured by the ‘investment multiplier’, 
can be so strong as to exceed the growth in public debt owing to the deficit. But if 
this fails to trigger the longer-term effect on growth potential, the reduction in the 
ratio of debt to GDP will be short-lived: the deficit will continue to fuel the debt and 
GDP will start to grow again at a pace similar to that preceding the spending boost. 
The  size  of  the  multiplier  depends  on  a  number  of  important  variables: 
maximizing the direct impact on GDP requires rapid and efficient interventions 
and the ability to identify those capable of determining an actual qualitative and 
quantitative increase in public capital; maintaining orderly financial conditions is 
vital to prevent the ‘crowding-out’ of private investment, which can be discouraged 
by a rise in interest rates. The careful selection of the programmes to finance is 
also crucial for achieving the longer-term effects on growth potential; it must not 
penalize the resources available for immaterial infrastructure.
The constraints imposed by the high public debt must not be overlooked. An 
unproductive increase in the deficit would end up worsening the outlook for the 
public finances, feeding investor doubts and raising the risk premium on Italian 
government securities. This could soon put the ratio of public debt to GDP on an 
unsustainable course.
Given the current public finance conditions and the low efficiency of public 
administration, any recourse to deficit spending requires caution, to ensure that 
resources are actually channelled to supporting economic activity in the short and 
longer term. Even if an effective investment policy were to succeed in putting 
the economy on a higher growth trajectory, it would still be necessary to define 
a credible strategy within the confines of fiscal objectives and reform plans, such 
as to determine a reduction in the risk premium on Italian government securities. 
In this scenario the ratio of debt to GDP would begin to gradually decline, all 
the more rapidly the smaller the difference between interest payments and the 
nominal growth of the economy and the larger the fiscal surplus net of interest 
expenditure.  
Public investment and aggregate demand
It  is  well  known  that  so-called  ‘direct’  public  spending,  such  as  that  on 
investment,  can  have  a  stronger  impact  on  aggregate  demand  than  expenditure 
with ‘indirect’ effects, such as public transfers, a portion of which can be saved by 
their beneficiaries, to an increasing extent as income rises.
Any accurate assessment of the short-term macroeconomic effects of higher 
public investment is, however, subject to a large degree of uncertainty. The size 
of the multiplier (i.e. the increase in GDP generated by higher deficit spending) 
depends on many factors: the extent to which productive resources are utilized, 
the  monetary  policy  stance  and  attendant  financial  conditions;  eventual  lags 
and  inefficiencies  in  implementing  investment  programmes;  and  the  market’s 
assessment of the outlook for debt sustainability following a spending hike.
Simulations  made  over  a  short  to  medium  term  horizon  using  the  Bank 
of  Italy’s  quarterly  econometric  model  indicate  that  in  the  most  favourable 
scenario the multiplier is above one and the increase in GDP obtained by higher 
investment leads to a reduction in the ratio of debt to GDP over a five-year period  
(Table 1). It is reasonable to suppose that if investments are not carefully selected, 
or their implementation dogged by waste and inefficiencies, the multiplier would 
be considerably lower, nearing the (lower) one for spending on transfers. In such a 
scenario the ratio of public debt to GDP would rise. A similar result would obtain 
if the spending plan were to stoke investor fears: higher financing costs (for the 
public sector and therefore for the private one as well) would weaken the stimulus 
to economic activity from increased investment, while the deficit would widen both 
because of lower economic growth and the progressive rise in interest expenditure.

It is difficult to assess the potential impact of a higher deficit on sovereign 
risk  premiums:  the  relationship  is  non-linear  and  volatile,  influenced  by  many 
variables some of which are not immediately quantifiable. If the fiscal expansion 
were accompanied by a deterioration in investor confidence such as that which, 
for various reasons, occurred between 2011 and 2012, the impact on interest rates 
could, like then, be especially strong. It is impossible to apply to cases like this the 
estimates based on the figures recorded in advanced economies in normal financial 
conditions. Nor should it be forgotten that every year the State must issue around 
400 billion euros in public debt.
The econometric model does not explicitly take account of the complementarity 
between public and private capital in firms’ production function. Public investments 
capable  of  increasing  the  profitability  of  private  capital,  by  encouraging  its 
accumulation, can translate into higher values of the multiplier.1 The empirical 
literature on this complementarity is extensive but – in part owing to non-negligible 
methodological difficulties – has not produced univocal findings. The estimated 
effects nevertheless confirm its importance.2
While  the  simulations  are  not  fully  comparable,  econometric  exercises 
conducted by other institutions nonetheless highlight the key role of the factors I 
mentioned earlier: the reaction of monetary policy, the ability to select investment 
programmes judiciously and carry them out without delay or waste, and expectations 
concerning future developments in public finances (Table 2).3 
Public investment and growth potential
Economic analysis has long recognized that technical progress and total factor 
productivity dynamics are the true engine of economic growth in the advanced 
countries, where the driving forces of the initial rapid accumulation of physical

capital and of labour force growth have waned. An adequate endowment of public 
capital can facilitate the adoption of new technologies and the reorganization of 
production processes, also fostering the creation of new firms. It can prove essential 
in  supporting  the  early  development  of  especially  innovative  technologies.  It 
must  be  acknowledged,  however,  that  the  relationship  between  public  capital 
accumulation and economic development, while crucial, remains largely elusive.
Of course, public capital comprises not only material infrastructure − such 
as  transport,  telecommunications  and  energy  networks  −  but  also  the  body  of 
knowledge and skills available to an economy. These two types of infrastructure, 
material and immaterial, share some of the characteristics of public goods, and 
without government intervention they would be available in insufficient quantity. 
The State supports investment in immaterial capital in two ways. Directly, 
through scientific research in public universities and public research institutions 
and through the provision of education; indirectly, in the form of subsidies and 
tax  incentives to  the  private  sector.  There  is  evidence  that  both  these  forms  of 
intervention, if well designed, have a positive impact on economic growth. In a 
context of rapid technological change, fostering investment in human capital and 
improving  its  quality  appears  equally,  if  not  more,  important  than  investing  in 
material infrastructure, especially in our country. Public spending on education 
is around 4 per cent of GDP, much lower than the euro-area average (Figure 1). 
Among the advanced countries, Italy’s labour force has one of the lowest rankings 
for labour force skills.4 The gap with the other countries is also pronounced for 
research and development, although this is due almost entirely to the private-sector 
component of expenditure (Figure 2).
Public investment expenditure and infrastructure endowment in Italy
In Italy, general government gross fixed capital formation has decreased in 
recent years and is below that recorded in other European countries (Figure 3). In 
nominal terms, it has fallen by an annual average of 4 per cent since 2008; while 
less evident, this downward trend is also visible in the rest of the euro area. As a 
percentage of GDP, expenditure in Italy diminished from 3 per cent in 2008 to 2 
per cent in 2017; the reduction was concentrated in local government entities. The 
European Commission has recently estimated a public investment gap for Italy.5

It is worth bearing in mind that the economic meaning of the expenditure items 
does  not  always  coincide  with  accounting  classifications.  The  outlays  recorded 
in general government accounts under the item ‘gross fixed investment’ are not 
entirely allocated to material infrastructure, nor do they represent the totality of the 
financial resources earmarked for such purposes. About half of the outlays concern 
other  types  of  expenditure,  for  example  that  on  plant,  equipment  and  patents. 
Investment in material infrastructure is also made by non-public sector entities that 
nevertheless carry out public utility projects (e.g. licenced operators in the railway, 
motorway, energy and telecommunications sectors).6 Only part of this expenditure 
goes through government financial accounts and is recorded under ‘contributions 
to  investments’,  a  very  heterogeneous  item  whose  composition  is  affected  by 
national specificities in the sectoral classification of the entities involved (within 
or outside the general government perimeter) and the ways in which public utilities 
are regulated.
Measuring a country’s infrastructure endowment is a complex exercise. One 
can use financial indicators based on the resources employed or instead rely on 
physical endowment indicators (e.g. the length and density of transport networks, 
energy  and  water  supply,  and  telecommunications),  which  can  also  reflect 
topographical differences between regions and the degree of efficiency with which 
the resources are utilized. Finally, there are indices whose aim is to capture the 
overall adequacy of infrastructural networks, as far as possible taking account of 
potential demand, network interconnections, and congestion phenomena.
If we use indicators based on the permanent inventory method, which accumulates 
the time series of annual investment expenditure net of the estimated depreciation, 
Italy’s situation appears broadly in line with that of the major euro-area economies 
(Figure 4). Compared with the early 2000s, the gap has widened with respect to 
France, but there has been an improvement compared with Germany and Spain.7
If we take physical indicators of infrastructure endowment and set them in 
relation to appropriate variables of scale, we get different results. For example, 
relative to the population (an albeit very rough measure of the potential demand for 
6 
In 2017 Ferrovie dello Stato made investments amounting to about €4.5 billion (€4.3 billion in 2016), 
almost entirely through its subsidiary RFI SpA, which manages the rail network. Autostrade per l’Italia 
invested about €600 million; the second largest operator, Gavio, invested another €200 million. For the 
telecommunications network, TIM invested about €3.5 billion. As regards electrical infrastructure, in the 
two years 2016-17 Enel invested over €2.5 billion, and Terna more than €1.9 billion. For the natural gas 
network, Snam made investments amounting to about €2.7 billion in the last three years.

transport), the Italian road and railway networks turn out to be much less extensive 
than those of France, Germany and Spain. Similarly, if we look at the minimum 
travel time between two regions, weighted by population, Italy is once again at a 
disadvantage compared with the European average, suggesting the possible effects 
of congestion (Figure 5).8
Finally,  subjective  assessments  are  used  to  measure  the  adequacy  of  a 
country’s  entire  infrastructure  endowment  –  and  therefore  not  just  transport  – 
though great care must be taken when interpreting them. For example, the World 
Economic Forum produces a synthetic index covering 137 countries; Italy ranks 
58th, far behind all the other major European countries.9 According to a similar 
study conducted by the European Investment Bank in 2017 (though confined to 
European countries and municipal infrastructure), Italy is qualitatively analogous 
to Spain, but behind France, Germany and the EU average.10
All  in  all  we  can  see  a  gap  between  what  is  suggested  by  the  indicators 
constructed based on historical expenditure and what can be derived from more 
analytical  indicators  of  the  adequacy  of  infrastructure  networks  (Italy  is  found 
to be lagging behind the other European countries only by the second group of 
indicators).  It  could  be  assumed  that  this  gap  is  also  partly  attributable  to  less 
‘efficient’ completion of public works.11 As I remarked earlier, efficiency is a key 
variable  in  determining  the  macroeconomic  impact  of  investment  expenditure, 
both in the short and long term.
Completion of public works
While the available data do not enable us to make systematic and detailed 
comparisons, there is evidence that the average completion times and costs for 
public works are relatively high in our country. According to the audit performed 
in 2018 by the European Court of Auditors, Italy has the highest constructions costs 
of any EU country for completed high-speed rail lines (€28 million per kilometre, 
compared with €12 million for Spain, €13 million for Germany and €15 million

Territorial Structures and Dynamics, 2014.

for France). If we add up the costs of projects already completed with those in 
progress, we find that Italy’s cost per kilometre rises to €33 million, as against €14 
million for Spain and €15 million each for Germany and France. Our country also 
falls far behind in terms of completion times.12
Surveys conducted over the last decade have shown that, in Italy, the average 
costs  per  kilometre  and  completion  times  for  high-speed  rail  lines  have  been 
about three times those of France and Spain; the average costs per kilometre for 
roads were more than double those of Spain. As for major projects co-financed 
by the European Regional Development Fund, these studies indicated time and 
cost overruns in Italy equal, respectively, to more than triple and double the EU 
average.13 It does not seem that the extent of these differences can be explained 
merely by the distinctive orographic features of each country.
The  various  phases  of  construction  have  differing  impacts.  The  length  of 
‘transition’  periods,  that  is,  the  time  between  the  end  of  one  procedural  phase 
and the start of the next (for example, the planning and awarding of contracts) 
or between sub-phases (for example, preliminary, final and executive planning), 
has a considerable impact on project timelines. These periods, which are at least 
in  part  absorbed  by  administrative  activities  and  inefficiencies,  account  for  on 
average around 54 per cent of a project’s total duration (rising to 60 per cent if one 
considers only the planning phase).
Over the last few years average completion times have risen. The increase 
has related solely to the tendering and execution phases, while the length of the 
planning phase has remained fairly stable. But there are wide regional variations: 
it is estimated that the length of time required in Sicily, Molise and Basilicata to 
complete the same project is more than 30 per cent higher than that required in 
Lombardy and Emilia Romagna.14 This means that, over and above addressing a

than 5,000 km of infrastructure on ten high-speed rail lines covering around 50 per cent of the existing 
lines in Europe. See European Court of Auditors, A European High-Speed Rail Network: Not a Reality

scarcity of resources or the limitations of the applicable legislation, it is critical 
that we identify and spread best practices.
According to data from the National Anti-Corruption Authority on contracts 
awarded  by  Italian  municipalities  between  2009  and  2014,  for  equal  contract 
amounts, the tendering and execution phases were shorter for negotiated procedures 
than  they  were  for  competitive  ones  (by  about  one  year).  There  is,  however, 
evidence that although there are benefits in terms of cutting times, recourse to more 
discretional procedures by ‘less qualified’ contracting entities is associated with a 
decrease in the average productivity of the firms that are awarded contracts.15
Overall, given these considerations, the short to medium term macroeconomic 
impact of an increase in the resources allocated to public investment could be greater 
if directed towards projects that are already in progress (if chosen appropriately ex 
ante) instead of being used to fund new projects.
From  a  more  structural  standpoint,  it  is  crucial  that  the  entire  planning, 
assessment and monitoring process be rationalized.16 Improvements could result 
from  a  more  accurate  cost/benefit  analysis  during  the  project  selection  phase.  
A greater focus on the quality of planning (envisaged in the new Public Contracts 
Code) could, particularly for more complex interventions, make public investment 
more effective, despite extending the planning phase. More specifically, this could 
speed up the subsequent phases (especially the executive one), helping to stem the 
endemic phenomenon of bid renegotiations, which is among the main causes of 
time overruns and rising costs.17 It is important to reduce transition times.
There could also be benefits stemming from the appropriate use of the ‘e-procurement’ 
systems envisaged under the new Code which, besides ensuring greater transparency, 
would  also  reduce  timeframes.  The  proper  functioning  of  all  of  these  instruments 
depends, however, on there being competent contracting authorities that are able to use 
them correctly.  This is why it is vital that steps be taken to raise professional standards 
in the public sector,  starting with the measures to train the contracting authorities

which, more than two years after the new Code has come into force, have yet to be 
implemented. Otherwise, potentially virtuous, but more sophisticated, measures may 
even have the effect of slowing down less competent administrations.  The trend in 
tenders for public works contracts over the last two years – characterized by a dip 
in 2016 and  by a significant recovery in 201718 – has varied according to the type of 
contracting authority:  specifically, tenders decreased  (in  number and in value)  for 
‘less qualified’ contracting authorities, but rose slightly for the others (Figure 6).
Investment and sustainability of the public debt
The  evidence  available  suggests  that  Italy’s  infrastructure  endowment  is 
either inadequate or risks becoming so due to lack of maintenance. At the same 
time,  it  is  clear  that  the  interventions  required  must  be  accompanied  by  incisive 
improvements in the selection, planning and carrying out of public works: the fact 
that Italy’s infrastructure lags behind that of the other main economies is not just 
due to insufficient financial resources. Given its high debt-to-GDP ratio, Italy must 
make the best possible use of its resources; only in this way can a spending boost 
be consistent with debt sustainability. Deficit financing should be used with caution.
The dynamics of the debt-to-GDP ratio depend on the primary surplus and 
on the difference between the average cost of debt and the economy’s growth 
rate.  When  I  spoke  here  last  year,  I  underlined  how,  with  an  annual  average 
growth rate of around 1 per cent, inflation at 2 per cent (in line with the ECB’s 
objective), and the average cost of debt approaching pre-crisis levels, the gradual 
attainment and maintenance of a primary surplus of around 4 per cent of GDP 
would enable the debt-to-GDP ratio to be lowered to 100 per cent in the space of 
ten years.19 In that same scenario today, solely owing to the increase in the risk 
premium on government securities, the reduction of the ratio would be slower 
(Figure 7a); leaving the primary surplus at current levels, the debt-to-GDP ratio 
would fall slowly for a few years and then stabilize at around 120 per cent, a 
still high level that would continue to limit the capacity of the public finances to 
have a stabilizing effect during recessions and would leave Italy exposed to the 
turbulence of the financial markets.
18  The difficulties in adapting to the new Code may have influenced this trend.  The demand for public 
works, though recovering, is still lower than it was prior to 2011.
19  See I. Visco, ‘Sviluppo dell’economia e stabilità finanziaria: il vincolo del debito pubblico’, a speech made at 
the 63rd Meeting of Government Studies on ‘La tutela degli interessi finanziari della collettività nel quadro 
della contabilità pubblica: principi, strumenti, limiti’, Varenna, 21 September 2017. See also I. Visco, The 
Governor’s Concluding Remarks for 2017, in the Annual Report for 2017, Banca d’Italia, 29 May 2018.
11
As I have already mentioned, increasing spending on investment by means of 
deficit financing, without addressing growth potential, would only be of temporary 
benefit. Reducing the primary surplus by one percentage point of GDP compared with 
the current level would lead to a small decrease in the debt-to-GDP ratio thanks to 
the expansionary boost to economic activity; however, with no long-term increase in 
economic growth, the debt-to-GDP ratio would soon rise again, even if there were no 
negative reactions on the financial markets (Figure 7b). The situation would be different 
if the resources obtained by means of a larger deficit were used so as to increase growth 
potential and if the risk premium on Italian government securities were reduced: with 
annual growth of more than one percentage point and with the yields on government 
securities returning to the values recorded at the beginning of this year, the debt-to-GDP 
ratio would begin to follow a stable, albeit not particularly rapid, downward trajectory.
Above all, we must not underestimate the risks which, given the high level of 
public debt, an unproductive increase in the deficit would expose us to. A negative 
reaction on the markets – for example a 200 basis point increase in risk premiums, 
remaining below the level recorded at the end of 2011 – would trigger a rapid 
increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio; considering the negative impact on economic 
growth of the increase in interest rates and crisis of confidence, the ratio would 
soon be on an unsustainable path (Figure 7c).
 The debt reduction plan that I presented last year was an indicative scenario; 
it is possible to draw up prudent strategies, capable of guaranteeing the stability 
of the public finances combined with better growth prospects. This is the narrow 
path that has been much spoken of in these difficult years. 
We can follow this path slowly, one step at a time, by implementing a series of 
interventions that gradually produce benefits until all the necessary changes have 
been made. Or we can try to make the path wider by setting out a comprehensive 
strategy designed to redirect the public finances to more productive uses and to 
increase the efficiency of general government, especially in spending programmes 
aimed at accumulating both material and immaterial public capital and at supporting 
business activity and innovation.
It is in any case essential that the fiscal objectives are and appear to be strongly 
and credibly oriented towards financial stability, and that the reforms are effectively 
geared towards sustained – and inclusive – economic growth.

year in the 2018 DEF (1.9 per cent of GDP), the spread between Italian and German 
government  securities  remaining  at  current  values  (240  basis  points  for  ten-year 
bonds), the gradual normalization of monetary policy, and growth potential equal to 
1 per cent.
