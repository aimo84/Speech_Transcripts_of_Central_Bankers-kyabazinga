Overcoming Labor Shortages: 
Prospects for Sustainable Economic Growth 
Speech at the Meeting of Councillors of Nippon Keidanren 
(Japan Business Federation) in Tokyo 
Haruhiko Kuroda 
Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
Introduction 
It  is  a  great  honor  to  have  this  opportunity  to  address  such  a  distinguished  gathering  of 
business leaders in Japan today. 
 The  year  has  flown  by,  and  2018  is  now  just  a  week  away.  Today,  to  round  off  2017,  I 
would  like  to  take  a  look  back  at  this  year's  economic  developments  both  at  home  and 
abroad, and elaborate on Japan's current economic recovery phase -- the second longest in 
the  post-war  era  --  while  making  comparisons  with  past  recovery  phases,  focusing  in 
particular  on  labor  shortages  and  firms'  efforts  to  overcome  them.  I  would  then  like  to 
explain the Bank of Japan's conduct of monetary policy and close my speech by sharing my 
hopes for Japan's economy in the coming year. 
 I. The Global Economy in a New Phase 
I will start by talking about the global economy. At this meeting last year, I mentioned that 
the global economy at the time was entering a new phase by putting the negative legacy of 
the global financial crisis behind it. In fact, from a  somewhat longer-term perspective, the 
global economy seems to have reached a turning point this year after having been subdued 
since the global financial crisis in 2008. 
 Let  me  take  the  example  of  developments  in  world  trade  (Chart  1).  After  the  global 
financial  crisis,  growth  of  the  world  trade  volume  --  calculated  by  adding  up  the  import 
volumes  of  economies  worldwide  --  was  slower  than  global  economic  growth.  This 
deceleration in the growth of the world trade volume has been referred to as "slow trade." 
Production  activities  in  the  manufacturing  sector,  which  are  closely  linked  to  world  trade, 
were subdued as well. However, this trend has been changing from the second half of 2016 
to  this  year.  Partly  due  to  the  substantial  progress  in  inventory  adjustments  mainly  in 
emerging economies, trade in goods such as materials, IT-related goods, and capital goods 
has  become active  recently  and  the  world trade  volume  has  been  growing  at  a  faster  pace 
than the global economy again. Accordingly, business sentiment in the manufacturing sector 
on a global basis hit bottom in the first half of 2016 and improved markedly this year. Given 
that  the  growth  rates  of  both  advanced  and  emerging  economies  have  been  rising 
moderately, the global economy has been growing in a well-balanced manner. 
 1 
Going forward, the global economy is expected to continue growing at a moderate pace. In 
the  World  Economic  Outlook  (WEO)  released  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF), 
growth projections have continued to be revised upward, and both advanced and emerging 
economies  are  expected  to  maintain  their  firm  growth  through  next  year.  At  international 
conferences  I  have  recently  attended,  a  frequently  used  phrase  has  been  "synchronous 
growth" of the global economy. At those conferences, participants from various economies 
all  looked  brighter  than  they  used  to,  which  has  given  me  the  strong  impression  that  the 
global economy has entered a new stage. 
 II. Economic Developments in Japan: Long-Lasting Recovery 
Next,  I  will  touch  upon  developments  in  Japan's  economy.  The  economy  has  improved 
steadily  this  year,  backed  in  part  by  the  developments  in  the  global  economy  that  I  just 
outlined. Real GDP for the July-September quarter registered relatively high growth of 2.5 
percent  on  an  annualized  basis,  representing  positive  growth  for  the  seventh  consecutive 
quarter since the January-March quarter of 2016. 
 In detail, Japan's exports have been on an increasing trend, mainly led by IT-related goods 
exports  to  Asia.  Domestic  demand  has  also  increased.  Specifically,  business  fixed 
investment has  continued  on  an  increasing  trend  with  corporate  profits  improving.  Private 
consumption  has  been  increasing  moderately,  albeit  with  fluctuations,  against  the 
background  of  steady  improvement  in  the  employment  and  income  situation.  Public 
investment also has remained at a relatively high level due in part to the implementation of 
the government's stimulus measures formulated in fiscal 2016. As these developments show, 
Japan's  economy  is  currently  expanding  moderately  in  a  well-balanced  manner,  supported 
by  multiple  factors  --  namely,  external  demand,  domestic  private  demand,  and  domestic 
public demand. Another salient feature of Japan's recent economy is that the benefits of the 
economic expansion have been spreading to a wide range of economic entities. According 
to the Bank's Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan), the diffusion 
indexes  (DIs)  for  business  conditions  have  continued  to  be  positive,  not  only  for  large 
enterprises and manufacturers but also for small enterprises and nonmanufacturers (Chart 2). 
Also, by region, the DIs have improved significantly for all regions. 
  2 
The  current  economic  recovery  is  also  characterized  by  its  long  duration.  The  duration  of 
the current recovery phase, which started in December 2012, likely reached 60 consecutive 
months  in  November  2017  (Chart  3).  This  exceeds  the  57  months  of  the  Izanagi  boom, 
which  occurred  in  the  midst  of  the  period  of  high  economic  growth,  and  is  the  second 
longest  boom  in  the  post-war  era.  In  the  post-war  era,  the  longest  recovery  phase  is  that 
from 2002 through 2008, followed by the current one as the second, the Izanagi boom from 
1965 through 1970 as the third, and the Heisei boom from 1986 through 1991 as the fourth. 
 Each of the four recovery phases that I just mentioned has its own particular characteristics. 
During the Izanagi boom, for example, the economy achieved annual growth of more than 
10 percent on average amid a steadily increasing population and under the slogan "catch up 
with  and  overtake"  the  U.S.  and  European  economies.  Growth  expectations  at  that  time 
differed  substantially  from  those  today.  The  Heisei  boom  more  or  less  coincided  with  the 
so-called bubble period, when the expectations of a wide range of economic entities turned 
excessively  bullish  and,  as  a  result,  investment  and  consumption  activity  became 
overheated. 
 These  phases  have  similarities  as  well.  One  notable  similarity  is  that  all  four  phases 
witnessed  a  tighter  labor  market  than  the  periods  before  and  after  them.  This  past 
experience  offers  valuable  insights  into  how  the  current  acute  labor  shortages  may  affect 
wages  and  prices.  More  specifically,  the  experience  of  the  past  three  recovery  phases  can 
provide  us  with  important  clues  as  to  how  the  current  labor  shortages  could  transform 
Japan's economy going forward. In what follows, I would like to take a look back at  these 
past phases in more detail. 
 III.  Labor  Shortages,  Wages,  Prices,  and  Productivity:  Past  Experience  and  Implications 
for the Present 
Past Experience 
Before  comparing  the  current  recovery  phase  with  those  in  the  past,  I  would  like  to  first 
provide a theoretical introduction. Firms that face increases in costs  due to wage increases 
stemming from labor shortages will generally consider the following two options. One is to 
pass on the increase in wage costs to the sales prices of their products and services with a 
 3 
view to securing profits. The other is to undertake labor-saving investment and streamline 
production and sales processes in response to labor shortages, and thereby provide a larger 
amount of products and services with the same number of employees. This allows firms to 
secure  profits  without  passing  on  increases  in  wage  costs  to  sales  prices.  For  example,  if 
hourly  wages  of  employees  double  due  to  labor  shortages,  firms  will  still  be  able  to 
maintain  the  same  level  of  profitability  without  raising  the  prices  of  their  products  if  they 
introduce  new  production  facilities  that  enable  employees  to  produce  twice  as  much  per 
employee as before. 
 From a macroeconomic perspective, increases in firms' sales prices will lead to a rise in the 
general  price  level,  while  improvements  in  the  efficiency  of  individual  firms'  production 
and sales processes will lead to higher productivity in the economy as a whole. Increases in 
nominal wages caused by labor shortages can be decomposed into two components: the part 
that is passed on to general prices and the rest, which is absorbed by the increase in labor 
productivity.  Put  differently,  if  we  subtract  the  increase  in  prices  from  the  increase  in 
nominal wages, the remainder will reflect the increase in productivity. This corresponds to 
the rise in real wages, which represents an increase in households' real income. This raises 
households'  purchasing  power,  stimulating  private  consumption,  which  in  turn  will  spur 
new investment by firms through a rise in corporate profits. In this manner, the mechanism 
will  start  to  operate  by  which  increases  in  wages  create  a  virtuous  cycle  from  income  to 
spending and encourage further economic expansion. 
 As mentioned earlier, in each of the four recovery phases, including the current one,  labor 
market conditions tightened or have tightened. However, the specific degree to which labor 
market  conditions  tightened  differs  by  phase  (Chart  4).  During  the  recovery  phase  in  the 
mid-2000s,  the  active  job  openings-to-applicants  ratio  rose  only  to  around  1,  which  was 
insufficient to trigger the virtuous cycle just mentioned. Under these circumstances, upward 
pressure  on  wages  was  limited,  so  that  deflation  continued  and  private  consumption 
remained subdued. Despite being the longest in the post-war era, the economic recovery in 
the  mid-2000s  seems  to  have  not  been  self-sustaining,  but  relied  on  external  demand  and, 
more specifically, the credit bubble in the United States fuelling that demand. 
  4 
In  contrast,  during 
the 
Izanagi  and  Heisei  booms,  when 
the  active 
job 
openings-to-applicants ratio increased nearly to 1.5 -- almost the same level as today -- and 
labor  shortages  became  acute,  wages  increased  and  the  virtuous  cycle  described  earlier 
firmly  took  hold.  I  would  now  like  to  take  a  close  look  at  developments  in  each  of  these 
phases. 
 Let  me  start  with 
the 
Izanagi  boom.  During 
this  period, 
the  active 
job 
openings-to-applicants  ratio  increased  to  1.49,  which  is  very  similar  to  the  level  today. 
Economic history textbooks as well as writings at the time suggest that, with wages rising 
due to acute labor shortages, firms simultaneously pursued the two options just described; 
that  is,  they  passed  on  the  increased  costs  to  sales  prices,  and  they  improved  production 
efficiency  (Chart  5).  The  degree  of  pass-through  to  sales  prices  depended  on  individual 
firms and the industry to which they belonged. Since small firms in the service sector such 
as Japanese-style inns and barbershops, for instance, were so labor intensive that they could 
not  absorb  increases  in  wage  costs  through  the  streamlining  of  business  processes  and 
improvements in efficiency, they more or less fully passed on the increases in wage costs to 
services  prices.  According  to  statistics  of  the  time,  the  cost  of  a  haircut  increased  at  an 
average  annual  rate  of  10  percent  during  this  period.  On  the  other  hand,  faced  with  acute 
labor shortages, many small and medium-sized firms especially in the manufacturing sector 
actively  invested  in  new  facilities  and  equipment  to  improve  efficiency.  Such  investment 
was  also  stimulated  by  the  growth  of  processing  and  assembly  industries,  such  as  electric 
machinery  and  automobiles,  which  involved  many  manufacturing  firms.  For  a  certain 
period  after  the  end  of  World  War  II,  there  was  a  significant  productivity  gap,  called  the 
"dual  structure,"  between  large  firms  with  high  capital  intensity  and  small  firms  with  low 
capital  intensity.  However,  the  gap  narrowed  significantly  during  the  Izanagi  boom,  when 
small and medium-sized manufacturing firms actively invested in facilities and equipment. 
In this way, not only did prices rise, but firms' efforts to raise productivity also drastically 
intensified.  As  a  result,  real  wages  increased  notably,  thereby  substantially  boosting 
households' purchasing power. It is during this period that the penetration of durable goods 
such as private cars, color TV sets, and air conditioners  -- the so-called "3Cs" -- increased 
rapidly. Furthermore, the surge in private consumption encouraged firms to undertake more 
 5 
investment  aimed  at  producing  higher  value-added  products.  Literally,  with  wages  and 
prices increasing, a virtuous cycle from income to spending was in place. 
 A  similar  mechanism  operated  in  the  Heisei  boom,  which  started  from  1986  (Chart  6). 
Amid  an  increase  in  the  active  job  openings-to-applicants  ratio  to  nearly  1.5,  the  annual 
growth rate of scheduled wages rose to around 4 percent. Since part of the increase in wage 
costs was passed on to prices of products and services, the annual price inflation rate rose to 
around 3 percent. While it needs to be taken into account that expectations at the time were 
excessively  bullish,  firms  increased  fixed  investment,  boosting  labor  productivity. 
Manufacturing  firms  proactively  introduced  new  technologies  such  as  micro-electronic 
equipment,  including  robots,  and  nonmanufacturing  firms  made  efforts  to  streamline 
administrative  work  through  office  automation.  As  a  result,  real  wages  increased,  raising 
households' purchasing power. Many of you may remember the consumer boom at that time, 
leading to proactive investment by firms. 
 Implications for the Current Recovery Phase 
Based on the experience of the past, I would like to explore wage and price developments as 
well as firms' efforts to raise productivity in the current recovery phase. 
 Let me start with wage developments. The year-on-year rate of increase in hourly wages of 
part-time  employees,  which  are  particularly  sensitive  to  labor  market  conditions,  has 
accelerated to the range of 2.0-3.0 percent. For full-time employees, base pay at many firms 
has  increased  for  four  consecutive  years,  suggesting  that  upward  pressure  on  wages  has 
been gradually but steadily increasing (Chart 7). That being said, it cannot be denied that, 
relative to the strength of the economy and degree of labor market tightening, the pace of 
increase in wages is more sluggish than in past recovery phases. While there may be many 
reasons  for  this,  it  seems  that  the  15  years  of  deflation  are  still  greatly  affecting  the 
economy  today,  particularly  with  regard  to  the  weak  developments  in  wages.  In  Japan, 
wages  of  full-time  employees  are  said  to  be  not  very  sensitive  to  developments  in  labor 
market conditions. While the return of base pay increases signals an important improvement 
in the wage situation, firms' wage-setting stance has remained cautious on the whole. Some 
have argued that, reflecting that both labor and management in Japan place priority on the 
 6 
long-term  stability  of  employment  and  wages  over  wage  increases,  firms  avoided 
large-scale  layoffs  and  wage  cuts  under  deflation,  so  that  firms  cannot  simply  switch  to 
increasing wages even when the economy grows and labor market conditions tighten. 
 Next, I will talk about developments in prices and productivity. As I just mentioned, wages 
have  been  increasing  gradually,  albeit  at  a  slower  pace  than  in  the  past.  Under  these 
circumstances, it seems that many firms so far have been making efforts to raise their labor 
productivity  and  absorb  increases  in  wage  costs  rather  than  raising  their  sales  prices.  For 
instance,  a  wide  range of  firms  mainly  in  the  nonmanufacturing  sector  have  recently  been 
proactively  undertaking  labor-saving  and  efficiency-improving  investment.  The  software 
investment  plans  for  this  fiscal  year  of  some  industries  such  as  construction,  retailing,  as 
well  as  accommodations  and  restaurants  showed  significant  increases  compared  to  the 
actual  investment  made  last  year.  Meanwhile,  specific  examples  of  labor-saving  and 
efficiency-improving  investment  include  hotels  and  Japanese-style  inns  using  artificial 
intelligence  (AI)  or  robots  to  take  care  of  their  customers,  construction  firms  introducing 
drones  at  construction  sites,  and  transportation  firms  halving  the  number  of  workers  at 
warehouses by building automated ones. 
 In contrast to such efforts to raise productivity, moves to pass on increases in wage costs to 
sales prices have lacked sufficient strength on the whole, since so far such moves have been 
only observed at some firms in labor-intensive industries and industries with a high ratio of 
part-time  employees,  such  as  transport  and  dining-out.  The  experience  of  prolonged 
deflation again plays a major role; with consumers remaining reluctant to accept price rises, 
many firms are concerned about losing customers if they raise prices.  It seems so difficult 
for many  firms to take  the first step to  raise their prices that  they wait and see what other 
firms are doing.   
 In sum, during the current recovery phase, we have seen the mechanism in place by which 
labor  shortages  exert  upward  pressure  on  wages,  which  encourages  firms  to  raise  sales 
prices  and  work  toward  raising  labor  productivity.  In  this  regard,  the  current  recovery  is 
more like the  Izanagi and Heisei booms rather than the  recovery in the  mid-2000s. But at 
the same time, the mechanism is weaker so far in the current phase than in those two phases. 
 7 
In particular, it has been taking time for firms' stance to shift toward increasing wages and 
prices despite acute labor shortages. 
 Nevertheless, economic conditions supportive to wage growth are clearly being put in place. 
The  active  job  openings-to-applicants  ratio  already  exceeds  the  peak  levels  of  the  Izanagi 
and  Heisei  booms  and  the  unemployment  rate  is  now  firmly  below  3  percent,  suggesting 
that  Japan's  economy  is  virtually  at  full  employment.  Corporate  profits  are  at  record  high 
levels,  substantially  exceeding  the  levels  of  the  past  recovery  phases  (Chart  8).  Going 
forward, supported by highly accommodative financial conditions, the economy is likely to 
continue  expanding  firmly  with  labor  market  conditions  tightening  further.  It  is  expected 
that  this  will  reinforce  the  mechanism  by  which  prices  and  labor  productivity  rise  along 
with wages, encouraging households and firms to increase expenditures. If this takes place, 
the economy will continue to expand in a more sustainable manner. 
 Let me add one important thing. Although I  made various comparisons to  the Izanagi and 
Heisei booms, there is one notable difference between these two booms. The Izanagi boom 
helped to form a large middle class, leading to a situation in which almost all Japanese felt 
that  they  belonged  to  the  middle  class,  and  provided  the  basis  for  subsequent  stable  and 
sustainable economic growth. In contrast, the economic growth of the Heisei boom proved 
to  be  unsustainable.  While  the  economy  saw  high  wage  growth  and  moderate  price  rises, 
the boom also gave rise to an asset bubble, the burst of which brought about the prolonged 
stagnation observed through the 2000s. In the current recovery phase, although no signs of 
excessively  bullish  expectations  are  observed  in  asset  markets  and  financial  institutions' 
behavior  so  far,  developments  in  financial  conditions  also  continue  to  warrant  close 
attention. 
 IV. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy 
Next, I will explain the Bank's conduct of monetary policy. 
 With  the  aim  of  achieving  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent,  the  Bank  has  continued 
with  powerful  monetary  easing  since  the  introduction  of  quantitative  and  qualitative 
monetary easing (QQE) in April 2013. To strengthen it further, the Bank introduced a new 
 8 
framework  of  "QQE  with  Yield  Curve  Control"  last  September.  I  am  convinced  that  the 
series  of  powerful  monetary  easing  measures  has  made  a  substantial  contribution  to  the 
current 60-month-long recovery phase that I talked about. 
 On  the  price  front,  the  annual  CPI  inflation  excluding  fresh  food  and  energy  has  been 
positive as a trend for about four years since October 2013 (Chart 9). This is the first time 
since  the  end  of  the  1990s  that  such  a  development  has  been  observed  in  Japan.  Japan's 
economy  is  no  longer  in  deflation,  which  is  generally  defined  as  a  sustained  decline  in 
prices. 
 As  I  mentioned  earlier,  however,  price  developments  in  Japan  have  remained  relatively 
sluggish compared to the economic expansion and the labor market tightening. Annual CPI 
inflation excluding fresh food and energy has remained  only slightly positive, and there is 
still a long way to go to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent.  Given this situation, 
the  Bank  will  continue  to  persistently  pursue  powerful  monetary  easing  under  the  current 
"QQE with Yield Curve Control," thereby more firmly supporting the mechanism in which 
the  virtuous  cycle  from  income  to  spending  continues  to  operate,  with  wages  and  prices 
increasing moderately. 
 V. Overcoming Labor Shortages: Hopes for the New Phase 
Given that there is little time left, I would like to conclude my speech. Today, I have taken a 
look back at past economic recovery phases and pointed out that the shortage of labor can 
give rise to increases in wages and prices, leading to a virtuous cycle in the economy. I am 
also  aware  that  labor  shortages  are  a  major  management  issue  that  individual  firms  have 
been  trying  to  address.  In  fact,  it  has  been  reported  at  the  quarterly  meetings  of  general 
managers of the Bank's branches that some firms have had to decline orders from customers 
due  to  labor  shortages.  Moreover,  some  have  raised  the  concern  that  the  acute  labor 
shortages may constrain Japan's economic growth. 
 However, I do not share this pessimistic view. The past recovery phases that I talked about 
today  provide  grounds  for  my  stance.  Past  experience  shows  that  in  the  process  of 
overcoming  labor  shortages,  Japan's  economy  boosted  its  growth  potential  through 
 9 
individual  firms'  efforts  to  raise  their  productivity.  Labor  shortages  are  only  one  example, 
and Japan's economy has repeatedly proved that something that initially was considered as a 
constraint  on  economic  growth  turned  out  actually  not  to  be  a  constraint,  but  rather 
something  that  led  the  economy  into  a  new  phase.  When  Japan  was  hit  by  the  two  oil 
shocks  in  the  1970s,  there  were  concerns  that  natural  resource  shortages  would  constrain 
Japan's  economic  growth  and  pessimistic  views  that  Japan's  economic  growth  rate  would 
fall  to  zero  prevailed.  The  reality  was  that  proactive  energy-saving  investment  by  many 
firms made Japan's economy the most energy-efficient economy in the world, enabling it to 
overcome the challenges posed by the jump in oil prices. More recently, after the Great East 
Japan  Earthquake,  a  concern  was  that  electric  power  supply  shortages  and  supply  chain 
disruptions  could  be  a  major  constraint  on  economic  activity.  However,  many  firms 
recovered  their  production  capacity  remarkably  quickly  by  increasing  in-house  power 
generation facilities and rebuilding or relocating production sites. 
 As these examples indicate, the economy can grow by overcoming what in the short run are 
considered  as  constraints.  A  driver  of  overcoming  such  constraints  has  always  been 
individual firms' proactive efforts. I am convinced that this is also the case with the current 
labor  shortages.  I  have  full  confidence  in  the  problem-solving  abilities  of  Japanese  firms. 
While many firms have already started to address labor shortages through fixed investment 
and other measures, it is important for firms to take full advantage of business opportunities 
by  staying  ahead  of  their  competitors,  with  a  view  to  deploying  their  available  human 
resources  effectively.  In  order  for  firms  to  further  raise  their  growth  potential,  they  also 
need  to  secure  talented  human  capital  by  paying  the  appropriate  wages.  Under  deflation, 
taking a step ahead of others may have seemed risky and the best option may have been to 
wait patiently, but this situation has already changed. There are some firms that have shaken 
off the deflationary mindset and have proactively embarked on new initiatives. When more 
firms  follow  suit,  this  will  give  rise  to  a  virtuous  cycle  in  the  economy  as  a  whole,  with 
prices  rising  moderately  as  wages  and  productivity  increase,  leading  to  sustainable 
economic growth. 
 I sincerely hope that the year 2018 will be a wonderful one for all of you, and that you will 
overcome the challenges posed by labor shortages, helping Japan's economy to enter a new 
 10 
phase. The Bank will continue to provide you with the maximum support in our role as the 
central bank. 
 Thank you for your attention.
