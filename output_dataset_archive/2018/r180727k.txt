Abstract 
 
Despite the recent strong economic recovery, growth in wages and prices has been sluggish 
across  the  globe.  Japan  has  come  to  face  this  issue  ahead  of  any  others.  The  policy 
authorities  of  each  economy  could  learn  something  from  the  case  study  of  Japan.  This 
article will examine some factors that have restrained growth in wages and prices in Japan, 
and discuss the desired policy responses to address this issue. 
 
In relation to the theme of this session – inequality, wages, and growth – factors responsible 
for this curb on growth in wages and prices can be divided primarily into two categories. 
One is "hysteresis" brought about by past serious economic downturns. Serious economic 
downturns have left persistent damage to the supply side of the economy through various 
channels, including an increase in the number of "discouraged workers" and "involuntary 
non-regular employees," a slowdown in (human) capital accumulation, and the inefficient 
business processes that took root under excessive competition. This damage has created the 
slack  that  is  easing  the  upward  pressure  on  prices  that  has  come  from  an  expansion  in 
demand. Besides this hysteresis, the second category includes factors of a more structural 
nature  that  reduce  upward  pressure  on  wages  amid  an  increase  in  labor  demand.  These 
factors include: an increase in labor participation of women and the elderly, whose wages 
are  relatively  low;  firms'  and  households'  anxiety  for  the  future;  and  technological 
innovation  in  the  IT  industry,  such  as  robotic  process  automation  (RPA)  and  artificial 
intelligence (AI). 
 
If the supply-demand conditions continue to tighten, the factors in the former category will 
eventually  mitigate  with  hysteresis  reversing.  Moreover,  the  reversal  of  hysteresis  is  a 
desirable  change,  in  that  it  can  enrich  people's  lives.  To  bring  this  about,  the  Bank  is 
expected  to  continue  to  maintain  the  adequate  level  of  tightening  of  supply-demand 
conditions, thereby supporting the reversal of hysteresis. Given that it could take some time 
to reverse hysteresis, the Bank needs to conduct monetary policy while closely monitoring 
the economic and financial conditions so that no severe distortion will be created under the 
prolonged  accommodative  financial  condition.  Meanwhile,  factors  in  the  latter  category 
need to be addressed in a more structural way. Monetary policy and structural policy must 
1 
nonetheless address the issue interactively, since these factors are somewhat related to each 
other. 
 
This  article  consists  of  three  sections.  Sections  I  and  II  are  assessments  of  the  factors 
responsible for sluggish growth in wages and prices, jointly written by Makoto Sakurai and 
Masahiko Kataoka. Section III is a personal assessment by Makoto Sakurai of the current 
situation and what policy responses should be made.

I. Reversal of Hysteresis 
Serious economic downturns create persistent damage to the economy.1  Since the 1990s, 
the  growth  trend  in  Japan's  economy  marked  a  significant  fall  following  each  serious 
economic  downturn.  This  is  attributable  to  persistent  damage  to  the  supply  side  of  the 
economy  through  various  factors  such  as  an  increase  in  the  number  of  "discouraged 
workers,"  who  are  deterred  from  seeking  employment  despite  wanting  to  work,  and 
"involuntary  non-regular  employees,"  who  reluctantly  accept  employment  as  non-regular 
employees, together with a slowdown in (human) capital accumulation, and the inefficient 
business  processes  that  took  root  under  excessive  competition.  While  an  economic 
downturn  is  fundamentally  assumed  to  be  a  cyclical,  or  demand-side,  phenomenon,  the 
mechanism by which it influences the medium- to long-term growth trend through damage 
to the supply capacity is referred to as "hysteresis." 
 
It has also been pointed out that hysteresis that arose in earlier periods can be reversed to a 
certain degree amid robust aggregate demand.2  In Japan, the uptrend in economic growth 
has  been  increasing  recently  in  a  situation  where  aggregate  demand  has  continued  to 
increase strongly, and the aforementioned damage to the supply side of the economy is also 
being mitigated. Under the circumstances, growth in wages and prices has been contained. 
Specifically,  the  expansion  of  the  supply  side  of  the  economy  due  to  the  reversal  of 
hysteresis eases the upward pressure on wages and prices that has come from an increase in 
aggregate demand. In other words, hysteresis that arose in earlier periods has created the 
slack that is easing the tightening of supply-demand conditions. Past economic downturns 
in  Japan  have  been  more  serious,  and  even  more  frequent,  than  in  other  advanced 
economies.  Against  this  background,  the  hysteresis  in  Japan  might  remain  relatively 
deep-rooted (Chart 1). 
                                                   
1  For  example,  Cerra  and  Saxena  (2008)  conducted  an  empirical  analysis  of  past  financial  and 
political  crises  and  found  that,  in  many  serious  crises,  the  adverse  impact  on  the  growth  rate 
persisted even after a decade. 
2  For example, Ball (2015) states that past damage to the supply capacity can be reversed under a 
"high-pressure economy" -- that is, a continued expansion of the economy -- and that the Federal 
Reserve might be justified in maintaining a low-interest rate environment for a longer period, as long 
as  inflation  expectations  are  anchored.  Yellen  (2016)  argues  that,  although  this  point  deserves 
consideration,  the  risk  of  an  accumulation  of  financial  imbalances  and  price  instability  warrants 
attention. 
3 
 
In  what  follows,  the  changes  that  have  taken  place  in  Japan's  supply  capacity  since  the 
1990s  will  be  discussed  by  focusing  on  hysteresis  associated  with  labor  input  and  labor 
productivity. 
 
A. Labor Input 
1. Decline in the labor force participation rate 
A  decline  in  the  labor  force  participation  rate  is  one  of  the  channels  through  which 
hysteresis associated with labor input occurs. There are a number of reasons why people 
find it increasingly difficult to get a job as their period of unemployment becomes longer: 
for  example,  their  abilities  diminish  relatively  since  they  are  unable  to  enhance  their 
practical skills through work experience, and prolonged unemployment becomes a stigma in 
their career.3  Consequently, some of those who are unemployed for a prolonged period will 
give up seeking employment and become discouraged workers, who are regarded as being 
excluded from the labor force population. In fact, after the bursting of the asset bubble in 
the  early  1990s,  the  labor  force  participation  rate  in  Japan  turned  down  sharply,  and  the 
labor force population also started to decline. 
 
However, the labor force participation rate has recently turned to an uptrend amid the long 
period of continued economic expansion. As news reports about labor shortages increase 
and  firms  dig  deeper  into  the  labor  market  by,  for  example,  relaxing  their  recruitment 
criteria, people who once gave up seeking employment have now started to participate in 
the labor market again. Reflecting these developments, the number of discouraged workers 
is  declining  (Chart  2).  Along  with  the  factors  which  have  led  to  labor  participation  of 
women  and  the  elderly  as  mentioned  later,  the  size  of  labor  force  has  increased  by  2.21 
million in the six years since the beginning of 2012, and this accounts for nearly two thirds 
of the 3.34 million increase in the number of employed persons. 
 
                                                   
3  Referring to firms' reactions to job applicants' résumés, Kroft and Lange (2012) showed that, if 
unemployment exceeds a certain period of time, this will  make it harder for the applicant to find 
employment because of stigmatization and other factors. 
4 
2. Increase in involuntary non-regular employees 
Another  channel  through  which  hysteresis  is  generated  is  the  increase  in  the  number  of 
involuntary  non-regular  employees,  who,  despite  wanting  to  become  regular  employees, 
reluctantly  accept  employment  as  non-regular  employees,  due  mainly  to  "the  absence  of 
firms  that  will  employ  them  as  regular  employees."  Job  offers  for  regular  employees 
decrease and the number of involuntary non-regular employees increases when firms shift 
to  hiring  non-regular  employees  to  cut  labor  costs  and  secure  employment  flexibility  in 
response to an economic downturn. It has been pointed out that if someone begins working 
as  a  non-regular  employee  upon  graduation,  they  are  subsequently  less  likely  to  be 
employed  as  a  regular  employee.4  Since  working  hours  for  non-regular  employees  are 
relatively short, an increase in the number of involuntary non-regular employees leads to a 
decline in labor input. Since the 1990s, the number of involuntary non-regular employees 
has  increased  substantially  in  Japan,  as  firms  have  sought  to  benefit  from  employing 
non-regular employees. 
 
That being  said, the  number  of  involuntary  non-regular  employees  has  recently  begun  to 
decline amid an increase in labor demand. With a view to securing additional labor force 
and  retaining  existing  human  resources,  firms  are  increasing  the  recruitment  of  regular 
employees  and  converting  non-regular  employees  into  regular  employees.  While  the 
number  of  involuntary  non-regular  employees  has  decreased  by  0.85  million  in  the  five 
years  since  early  2013,  the  number  of  regular  employees  has  increased  by  1.35  million 
(Chart 3). 
B. Labor Productivity 
1. Sluggishness in business fixed investment 
Sluggishness  in  business  fixed  investment  can  be  cited  as  one  of  the  channels  through 
which hysteresis associated with labor productivity is generated. Such sluggishness leads to 
                                                   
4  Genda  et  al.  (2010)  examined  changes  in  type  of  employment  by  analyzing  the  data  of  labor 
statistics. The results showed that the type of employment upon graduation, especially for those with 
lower  education,  has  an  effect  on  future  employment  prospects.  The  following  were  given  as 
reasons:  non-regular  employees  do  not  have  adequate  chance  of  being  trained;  and  the  lack  of 
experience  in  being  employed  as  a  regular  employee  could  be  viewed  in  a  negative  light  by 
recruiters.

a deceleration in capital accumulation. An increase in aging capital stock and delays in the 
introduction  of  new  technology  contributes  to  a  sluggish  rise  in  total  factor  productivity 
(TFP).5  Since  the  bursting  of  the  asset  bubble  in  the  early  1990s,  Japanese  firms  have 
reined in fixed investment as they have been burdened with excess production capacity and 
excess debt, with the banking sector tightening their lending attitudes. Since then, business 
fixed  investment  has  been  contained  within  the  scope  of  depreciation  expenses  over  the 
years.  As  a  consequence,  aging  capital  stock  has  increased  and  the  introduction  of  new 
technology has tended to be delayed (Chart 4). 
 
2. Reduction in the cost of education and training 
Firms'  attempts  to  cut  costs  by  reducing  spending  on  education  and  training  leads  to  a 
deceleration in the accumulation of human capital and a sluggish rise in labor productivity. 
This  is  related  to  the  aforementioned  increase  in  the  number  of  involuntary  non-regular 
employees.  While  firms  address  skills  development  for  regular  employees  through 
systematic on-the-job training (OJT) and other programs, both on-site and off-site, they tend 
to  avoid  proactive  investment  in  the  training  of  non-regular  employees,  who  are  not 
intended to be employed for a long period in the first place. Since the 1990s, Japanese firms 
have  shifted  to  hiring  temporary  workers  rather  than  regular  employees  and  have 
endeavored to minimize the cost of education and training against the background of labor 
costs being a burden on corporate profits due to excessive employment (Chart 5). 
 
3. Excessive competition among firms 
Excessive competition among firms stemming from protracted deficient demand may also 
have contributed to the decline in labor productivity. Since the 1990s, many Japanese firms 
have been drawn into fierce competition, cutting excessively the price of their products and 
providing extravagant services. As a result, inefficient work practices and the provision of 
excessively  high-quality  services  for  their  prices  have  been  seen  in  some  industries.  For 
example,  the  proportion of  businesses  in  the  wholesale and  retail industries  operating  24 
hours  a  day  increased  rapidly  from  1.6  percent  in  1994  to  5.5  percent  in  2014.  A 
questionnaire survey conducted on people who have resided in both Japan and the United 
States shows that a large number of services in Japan are regarded as lower in price for the 
                                                   
5  For example, see Haltmaier (2012).

quality (Chart 6).   
 
Japan's labor productivity appears to have declined through the various channels mentioned 
earlier.  It  is  often  pointed  out  that  labor  productivity  in  Japan  is  lower  than  in  other 
advanced  economies.  For  example,  Jorgenson  et  al.  (2016)  made  a  comparison  between 
Japan and the United States in the levels of labor productivity, showing that productivity in 
Japan was around 40 percent lower than in the United States in 2012. 
 
However,  factors  that  had  lowered  labor  productivity  are  now  being  addressed.  As 
supply-side  constraints  materialize  in  tandem  with  labor  shortages,  firms  are  proactively 
making fixed investment aimed at saving labor and increasing production capacity as well 
as  addressing  the  training  of  employees.  Firms  are  also  streamlining  inefficient  business 
processes such as unrequested re-delivery services and late-night services where sales are 
low. According to the OECD, Japan's labor productivity, though remaining at a low level, 
has  recently  been  improving  at  a  relatively  fast  pace  by  catching  up  with  that  of  other 
economies (Chart 7). 
 
II. Factors of a More Structural Nature 
Sluggish  growth  in  wages  and  prices  is  also  attributable  to  factors  of  a  more  structural 
nature.  The  following  section  will  consider  some  examples,  since  these  factors  are  also 
important from the viewpoint of the theme of today's session. 
 
A. Labor Force Participation of Women and the Elderly 
In Japan, where the population is rapidly aging and the birthrate is dropping sharply, the 
government  and  firms  have  been  promoting  the  active  participation  of  women  and  the 
elderly in the labor market. For example, steady progress has been made in increasing the 
number of nursery  schools and nursing homes as well as moves to extend or abolish the 
mandatory  retirement  age  (Chart  8).  As  a  result,  the  number  of  women  and  the  elderly 
participating in the labor force has been increasing. The aging of baby boomers has also 
contributed to the rise in the ratio of the elderly to the overall workforce. Since wages for 
women  and  the  elderly  have  tended  thus  far  to  be  relatively  low,  these  changes  provide 
firms facing labor shortages with low-cost labor, thereby easing upward pressure on wages 
7 
(Chart 9). 
 
Besides,  although  most women  used  to engage  in  jobs  with  simple  and  routine tasks,  an 
increasing  number  of  talented  women  have  shifted  to  more  professional  occupations, 
leading  to  an  increase  in  productivity.  It  has  been  noted  that  the  easing  of  labor  market 
conditions is also brought about by the diminishing of slack in terms of quality. 
 
B. Future Anxiety 
A possible decline in long-term growth potential of  the economy and anxiety over future 
income  in  anticipation,  for  example,  of  cuts  in  pensions,  results  in  a  rise  in  firms'  and 
households'  reserve  savings.  Such  anxieties  also  exert  downward  pressure  on  wages  and 
prices by restraining spending. The hardships that people suffered in past serious economic 
downturns  might  also  be  exacerbating  their  anxieties.  Japanese  firms  lack  confidence  in 
their long-term profit growth and are thus cautious about raising wages -- particularly, base 
pay -- that can lead to a rise in fixed costs (Chart 10). In addition, an increasing number of 
households are anxious about their future income and life plans, with the number of such 
households remaining at a high level since a surge in the 1990s. Their propensity to save 
money  seems  to  have  exacerbated  price  competition  among  firms,  bringing  about 
downward pressure on prices (Chart 11). 
 
C. Technological Innovation 
Advances in information technology such as RPA and AI might also be contributing to a 
curb  on  growth  in  wages  and  prices. These  technologies  can  contribute  to  improving  the 
value added and raising sales through, for example, the development of new products and 
services;  they  are  not  simply  a  means  to  push  down  wages  and  prices.  However,  few 
Japanese firms nowadays consider these technologies to be the key to expanding business 
opportunities in the market; rather, most firms tend to regard them as a means to enhance 
operational efficiency and cut costs (Chart 12). This tendency seems to lead to the easing of 
labor  market  conditions  and  downward  pressure  on  wages  and  prices.  Still  fresh  in  our 
minds are the announcements made in 2017 by each of Japan's three major banks of their 
decisions to reduce the work load that corresponds to a total of 33,000 employees within the 
next ten years through the use of information technology. 
8 
 
The widespread use of smartphones and the expansion of e-commerce are also contributing 
to sluggish price rises. Consumers can now easily refer to and compare a broad range of 
information on prices at the press of a button, and purchase goods and services even from a 
distance. It seems that these changes have increased consumers' responsiveness to prices, 
consequently somewhat accelerating price competition among firms. 
 
D. Factors Specific to Particular Industries 
In some industries, downward pressure on wages and prices is brought about by specific 
factors.  For  example,  although  the  medical  and  nursing  care  industries  are  expanding 
rapidly  amid  advanced  population  aging,  service  prices  in  these  industries  are  controlled 
under the remuneration systems for medical treatment and nursing care. Thus, wage growth 
in these industries has been sluggish despite high demand in the labor force, the tightening 
of labor market conditions, and the remarkable increase in the number of employees (Chart 
13). 
 
III. Framework of Monetary Policy 
As discussed thus far, it seems that both the reversal of hysteresis and the factors of a more 
structural nature have been constraining growth in wages and prices. With a focus on the 
reversal of hysteresis, which seems to be the more important factor for the time being, this 
is  perhaps  the  place  for  a  personal  assessment  of  the  current  situation  and  what  policy 
responses should be made to address the issue. 
 
A. Assessment of the Current Situation and Monetary Policy for the Time Being 
To  reiterate  the  impact  of  hysteresis,  the  expansion  of  the  supply  side  of  the  economy 
associated with the reversal of hysteresis seems to be restraining the upward pressure on 
prices exerted by an increase in demand. The active job openings-to-applicants ratio and the 
unemployment rate have been hovering at levels close to or above the peak level observed 
during  the  asset  bubble  period  of  the  early  1990s,  but  the  output  gap  has  remained  at  a 
relatively  low  level.  The  aforementioned  increase  in  labor  input  and  labor  productivity 
seems to have been easing the tightening of the output gap (Chart 14). 
 
9 
However,  there  is  no  need  to  be  unduly  pessimistic  about  the  situation.  There  are  two 
reasons  why.  First,  the  expansion  of  the  economy's  supply  capacity  associated  with  the 
reversal of hysteresis will not last forever. There are limits to the extent of such changes as 
participation  of  discouraged  workers  in  the  labor  market,  conversion  of  involuntary 
non-regular  employees  into  regular  employees,  and  streamlining  of  inefficient  business 
processes.  The  accumulation  of  (human)  capital  is  also  expected  to  decelerate  as  firms 
approach  the  frontiers  of  technology  and  skills  through  the  course  of  the  replacement  of 
aging capital stock and improvements in the education and training of employees. From a 
somewhat  longer-term  perspective,  the  effects  of  a  curb  on  growth  in  wages  and  prices 
through the expansion of supply capacity are expected to wane in due course. If a rising 
trend in prices strengthens, inflation is expected to accelerate gradually toward the 2 percent 
that  the  Bank  is  committed  to  achieving,  accompanied  by  a  rise  in  the  public's  inflation 
expectations brought about through the adaptive formation mechanism. 
 
Second,  the  reversal  of  hysteresis  is  itself  a  desirable  change  for  people's  lives.  An 
increasing number of people are participating in the labor market in ways that meet their 
wishes,  and  firms  are  promoting  a  shift  to  more  efficient  and  less  wasteful  working 
practices.  Firms  and  employees  are  raising  their  competitiveness  on  the  back  of  the 
introduction  of  new  fixed  investment  and  the  development  of  employees'  skills. Through 
these  changes,  the  long-term  growth  potential  of  Japan's  economy,  which  declined 
substantially in the past, is gradually strengthening again. 
 
Although price rises are being constrained at present, the momentum toward achieving the 
price stability target is being maintained. Furthermore, changes that will lead to improving 
people's lives and strengthening the economy's competitiveness are progressing steadily. It 
can be said that price rises are being restrained only temporarily as a side effect of such 
positive changes. In fact, amid the ongoing reversal of hysteresis, Japan's economy seems to 
be  in  a  very  favorable  condition  on  the  whole.  It  is  essential,  therefore,  for  the  Bank  to 
continue  to  conduct  monetary  policy  under  the  current  framework  for  the  time  being  to 
maintain  accommodative  financial  conditions,  so  that  it  can  also  continue  to  support  the 
reversal of hysteresis. 
 
10 
B. Future Policy Conduct in the Longer Run 
The next issue is a longer-term perspective; how monetary policy should be conducted in 
the  future.  The  reversal  of  hysteresis  might  take  some  time.  The  supply  side  of  Japan's 
economy  may  still  be  fairly  subdued  as  a  result  of  past  successive  serious  economic 
downturns.  Meanwhile,  changes  in  the  supply  side  of  economy  --  that  is,  the  reversal  of 
hysteresis -- proceed at a slow pace by nature. There is no consensus in academic or other 
circles regarding the extent to which and the time required for hysteresis to be eliminated. 
However, experts have argued that, under continued strong economic expansion, much of 
the hysteresis can be reversed, given time.6 
 
As for the outlook, the accommodative monetary policy might be maintained over a longer 
period,  since  the  reversal  of  hysteresis  could  take  a  long  time.  In  that  case,  it  will  be 
necessary to monitor the situation carefully to avoid any serious distortion in the economic 
and  financial  environment  under  prolonged  accommodative  financial  conditions.  The 
following two factors particularly warrant attention. 
 
First,  it  is  necessary  to  keep  a  careful  watch  to  prevent  any  significant  supply-demand 
imbalance. Changes in the economy's supply capacity proceed at a relatively slow pace. An 
excessive  increase  in  supply-side  constraints  under  prolonged  accommodative  financial 
conditions is undesirable. If economic swings amplify significantly, there could be adverse 
effects, such as inefficient resource allocation. The Bank may then be rushed into tightening 
its  monetary  policy,  possibly  resulting  in  an  interruption  in  the  course  of  the  reversal  of 
hysteresis. In this situation, prices might rise in the short run, but this will not be stable over 
the long run. In realizing the reversal of hysteresis, focus should not be placed solely on 
tightening  the  output  gap,  but  rather  on  maintaining  moderately  tight  supply-demand 
conditions for as long as possible. 
 
                                                   
6  Hall (2014) expresses the view that the extent to which and the time required for hysteresis to be 
dissipated  differs  for  each  element  of  the  supply  side  of  the  economy,  whether  it  is  TFP,  capital 
accumulation,  unemployment,  or  the  labor  force  participation  rate.  Kocherlakota  (2014)  -- 
expressing agreement with Hall's view -- notes that much of the hysteresis can be reversed ultimately, 
referring  to  the  fact  that  hysteresis  resulting  from  the  Great  Depression  was  eliminated  under 
vigorous demand during World War II. 
11 
Second, it is also necessary to pay due attention to the stability of the financial system. In an 
environment where accommodative financial conditions have been maintained over a long 
period, the risk of an accumulation of financial imbalances will be heightened. According to 
the  Bank's  assessment  presented  in  the  April  2018  Financial  System  Report,  although 
Japan's  financial  system  as  a  whole  is  not  showing  any  signs  of  overheating,  some 
indicators, such as the lending attitudes of financial institutions, are very close to a state of 
overheating.  Furthermore,  if  the  low  interest  rate  environment  continues  and  downward 
pressure  on  financial  institutions'  profits  becomes  prolonged,  the  functioning  of  financial 
intermediation may be undermined.   
 
Under  the  "yield  curve  control,"  which  the  Bank  adopts  as  one  of  its  policy  tools,  as 
inflation expectations rise and the long-term growth potential of the economy strengthens in 
accordance  with  the  reversal  of  hysteresis,  monetary  easing  effects  will  be  enhanced 
through  a  rise  in  the  natural  rate  of  interest  and  a  decline  in  real  interest  rates.7  When 
conducting monetary policy in the future, the Bank -- while taking account of the changes 
in the external environment -- should consider without prejudgment the most appropriate 
policy so as to avoid any serious distortion in the economic and financial environment. 
 
Upward  pressure  on  wages  and  prices  can  be  increased  by  appropriately  addressing  the 
factors of a more structural nature mentioned in Section II. In fact, wages for women are 
increasing steadily on the back of efforts by the government and firms to eliminate the wage 
gap  between  men  and  women.  In  addition,  with  the  assumption  of  a  further  decline  in 
population, the government is aiming to boost the number of foreign visitors and workers in 
order  to  raise  the  long-term  growth  potential  of  Japan's  economy  (Chart  15).  It  is  also 
working  toward  developing  IT-oriented  human  resources  that  are  expected  to  create  new 
value  rather  than  simply  raise  efficiency  and  cut  costs,  so  that  IT-related  technological 
innovation can be used for more creative and innovative economic activities. To raise the 
wages  for  nursing  care  workers,  the  government  plans  to  make  special  and  temporary 
                                                   
7  Under the "yield curve control," the Bank facilitates the formation of short- and long-term interest 
rates that are considered most appropriate in light of the 2 percent price stability target. In the Bank's
