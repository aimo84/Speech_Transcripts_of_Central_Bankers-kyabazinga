Dott. Fazio examines the progress of the Italian economy in terms of stability
and  recovery      Address  by  the  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Italy,  Dott.  Antonio  Fazio,  at  the
Annual Meeting of AIOTE/ASSOBAT/ATIC/FOREX held in Milan on 25/1/97.
Yesterday  the  effective  exchange  rate  of  the  lira  was  5  per  cent  higher  than  in
December  1994.  Compared  with  the  low  point  reached  in  the  March  1995  currency  crisis,  the
lira has appreciated by 25 per cent. To find a period in which the lira recovered to such an extent
and so fast, it is necessary to go back fifty years to 1947.
Inflation, measured on the basis of the cost-of-living index, fell to less than 4 per
cent  on  average  in  1996;  between  June  and  December  it  was  around  2  per  cent  on  an  annual
basis. According to preliminary figures, inflation in January of this year was less than 2 per cent.
The net external position of the Bank of Italy, excluding gold reserves, improved
from $28 billion at 31 December 1993 to $45 billion at the end of last year.
In 1994 purchases of foreign currency in the market, primarily in the first half of
the  year,  amounted  to  $7  billion;  in  1995  there  were  net  sales  totalling  $7  billion.  In  1996
purchases  were  renewed,  at  an  accelerating  pace  from  March  onwards.  Yesterday  the  foreign
currency  reserves  of  the  Bank  of  Italy  and  the  UIC  amounted  to  $35  billion,  after  using  $21
billion  to  repurchase  official  ecus  and  redeem  foreign  currency  swaps  and  other  short-term
liabilities.
Foreign exchange interventions have  been  carried  out  in  such  a  way  as  to  avoid
interrupting the appreciation of the lira. Between 1 March and 22 November 1996 the effective
exchange  rate  rose  by  4.7  per  cent;  the  lire  needed  to  buy  one  German  mark  decreased  from
1,056 to 998.
The lira’s re-entry in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism  on  25  November
1996  was  at  the  central  rate  of  990  against  the  mark  and  1,906  against  the  ecu.  The  new  rate
corresponds to a depreciation of 19 per cent compared with that obtaining before the September
1992 currency crisis.
The  lira  re-entered  the  ERM  after  the  performance  of  the  economy  and  an
appropriate combination of policies had re-equilibrated Italy’s external position, brought a sharp
slowdown in inflation and improved the outlook for the public finances.
The surplus on the current account of Italy’s balance of payments and the return
to  external  equilibrium  provide  a  solid  foundation  for  the  maintenance  of  the  internal  and
external stability of the lira.
1. The balance of payments
The actions to reduce the budget deficit, the new level of the exchange rate, wage
moderation and the stabilisation of prices  have  produced  a  shift  in  the  composition  of  demand
since  1993  that  has  permitted  growing  surpluses  on  the  external  current  account  after  a  long
series of deficits.
The surplus in 1996 is  estimated  to  have  been  around  70  trillion  lire,  or  3.7  per
cent of GDP. The surplus on goods and services was on the order of 90 trillion and in absolute
terms was the largest recorded by the leading industrial countries. The increase of 18 trillion lire
compared  with  1995  was  due  to  the  improvement  in  the  terms  of  trade,  estimated  at  4.7
percentage points.
BIS Review   15/1997

Exports of goods and services, after rising in volume by 10 per cent on average in
each of the three previous years, remained basically unchanged. Sales of goods and services to
the other EU countries diminished-as a result of the weakness of demand, whereas exports to the
emerging countries continued to increase at a good pace.
The share of Italian exports in world trade  declined  compared  with  the  previous
year, partly owing to a loss of competitiveness but mainly because of the unfavourable cyclical
situation in Europe, where more than half of Italy’s exports are directed.
Imports dropped by 2 per cent in volume, compared with increases of 9 per cent
in both 1994 and 1995 and a decrease of 8 per cent in 1993; they were affected by the weakness
of domestic demand for consumer and investment goods.
The competitiveness of Italian products has diminished compared with 1995, but
still  shows  a  large  improvement  on  the  period  before  the  September  1992  currency  crisis.
Measured  in  terms  of  producer  prices,  the  real  exchange  rate  of  the  lira  shows  a  gain  of
competitiveness of 10 per cent compared with the first half of 1992. In terms of labour costs, the
gain is on the order of 18 per cent (Figure 1).
The marked appreciation of  the  lira  in  1996  made  a  decisive  contribution  to  the
stabilisation of domestic costs and prices.
The effect of the good trade performance on the exchange rate and market interest
rates  was  reinforced  by  that  of  the  surplus  on  capital  movements.  Portfolio  investment  abroad
continued  regularly,  generating  an  outflow  of  53  trillion  lire;  foreign  investment  in  Italy
increased substantially to 122 trillion (Table 1).
2. Italy’s external position. The exchange rate of the lira
At the end of 1992 the country’s net liabilities amounted to 11 per cent of GDP;
at the end of 1996 the ratio was well below 4 per cent (Figure 2).
The current account surpluses that are forecast will bring the net external position
roughly into balance by the end of this year and then make Italy a net creditor. Part of the item
“errors and omissions” consists of capital outflows that are not recorded in the capital account;
accordingly, the country’s external position is almost certainly already in balance.
In  September  1996  non-residents’  holdings  of  Italian  government  securities
denominated in lire and foreign currency totalled 350 trillion lire, as against  290  trillion  at  the
end of 1995 and 100 trillion in December 1992.
This progression is evidence  of  foreign  investors’  growing  interest  in  the  Italian
securities  market,  but  it  is  also  the  result  of  a  policy  aimed  at  diversifying  the  sources  of
Treasury  finance.  It  exposes  the  domestic  market,  albeit  deep  and  efficient,  and  government
funding to interest rate movements in international markets and to the evaluations and decisions
of international investors.
The growing volume of public debt placed abroad  is  matched  by  the  steady  and
substantial  improvement  in  the  external  balance  of  the  private  sector.  Starting  from  a  net
external debtor position of around 90 trillion lire at the end of 1992, by September of last year
households and enterprises had built up a net creditor position of around 200 trillion (Table 2).
The  1992  currency  crisis  caught  Italian  households  and  enterprises  severely  off
balance; the latter, in particular, had built up substantial foreign currency liabilities,  trusting  in
the stability of the exchange rate, even though this confidence was at odds with the expectations
implicit in the significantly lower cost of borrowing in foreign currency compared with that in
lire.
BIS Review   15/1997

The depreciation of the lira resulted in Italian firms incurring heavy losses. In the
last few months of 1992 they began to reduce their foreign currency liabilities and build up their
foreign  currency  assets  and  continued  to  do  so  on  a  major  scale  in  the  following  years.  The
private sector’s gross external liabilities, about three quarters of which consisted of borrowings
by  non-financial  enterprises,  remained  virtually  unchanged  at  around  450  trillion  lire;  their
composition changed, however, as the foreign currency share fell sharply.
On  the  other  hand,  the  external  assets  of  enterprises,  households  and  other  non-
bank operators rose from 370 trillion lire at the end of 1992 to 650 trillion in September 1996,
with a significant increase in the proportion denominated in foreign currency.
The  recovery  of  the  lira  began  in  the  spring  of  1995,  partly  in  response  to
domestic  agents’  perception  of  the  return  to  a  balanced  external  position  in  foreign  currency
(Figure 3).
Compared  with  a  net  external  debtor  position  in  foreign  currency  of  52  trillion
lire  in  1992,  at  the  end  of  1995  households  and  enterprises  had  already  built  up  a  net  creditor
position of 118 trillion. In September 1996 this had risen to 126 trillion (Table 3).
In 1996 a major contribution to the improvement in the exchange rate came from
the net sales of foreign currency against lire by non-residents for portfolio investment purposes.
In  the  1992  currency  crisis  the  official  reserves,  acquired  in  connection  with
short-term capital inflows, proved evanescent in defending the exchange rate.
The central bank’s foreign currency reserves are now part of an external position
that is balanced overall and in surplus for the private sector.
The domestic savings accumulated in Italy over the years is now again equal to,
and in prospect will exceed, the sum of the country’s capital stock, created through public and
private  investment,  and  its  huge  public  debt,  contracted  principally  to  finance  the  current
spending of the public sector.
3. The global market
The  growing  international  integration  of  the  Italian  economy  has  profoundly
affected the composition of financial assets and liabilities.
The share of foreign assets, which accounted for 9.7 per cent of internal sectors’
total assets at the end of 1989, has risen in the nineties and was equal to 14 per cent at the end of
the second quarter of 1996 (Table 4).
The proportion in Italy is now similar to that in France; in Germany it is higher, at
around 20 per cent. Neither in these two countries nor  in  the  other  leading  industrial  countries
has it changed significantly in the nineties.
The  ratio  of  residents’  foreign  financial  assets  to  GDP  is  around  50  per  cent  in
Italy, 90 per cent in France and 80 per cent in Germany.
The  diversification  of  Italian  saving  through  investment  abroad  will  continue  in
line with the development of the financial system.
The growth in Italy’s foreign assets in the last few years has been accompanied by
a rapid increase in its foreign liabilities.
The total financial assets of the leading industrial countries rose from 510 to 550
per cent of GDP between 1989 and 1994. Most saving and investment in these countries still has
a domestic counterpart; the share of total financial assets with a foreign counterpart is around 10
per cent and equal to around 50 per cent of GDP (Table 5).
BIS Review   15/1997
- 4 -
The  total  of  the  six  leading  countries’  holdings  of  foreign  bonds  and  shares  is
equal to some $4 trillion, or roughly one quarter of their GDP.
International  financial  integration  has  led,  especially  in  the  nineties,  to  the
emergence of a single, world market for currencies and securities linking all the leading national
markets.
In this global market the pricing and trading of financial instruments are affected
by the underlying performance of the international economy as a whole. The pattern appears to
depend above all on the tendency prevailing among instruments denominated in dollars.
The influence exerted by US financial markets, and to an even greater extent by
dollar-denominated instruments, predominates in the world economy.
The financial assets and liabilities of the United States, including those with both
domestic and foreign counterparts, account for nearly 40 per cent of the corresponding totals for
the  six  leading  industrial  countries.  Japan’s  share  is  only  slightly  smaller,  while  Germany
accounts for around 8 per cent of the total and Italy 4 per cent (Table 6).
The close links with the dollar of the currencies of Latin America and many of the
emerging South-East Asian countries increase the importance of the US currency in determining
the international financial cycle.
The  correlation  between  the  yields  on  medium  and  long-term  securities  across
national markets appears to be close. Differentials tend to be larger during currency crises; when
conditions  are  calmer  and  inflation  rates  converge,  yields  become  more  closely  correlated  and
differentials smaller.
The  yields  on  short-term  assets  are  controlled  by  national  monetary  policies.  In
recent  years  there  has  been  a  notable  reduction  in  the  power  of  central  banks  to  control  long-
term yields directly.
Superimposed  on  the  underlying  pattern  of  long-term  rates  in  international
markets  there  is  a  set  of  differentials  that  reflect  the  inflation  expectations  present  in  each
country and the related medium-term expectations concerning the exchange rate.
The  response  of  long-term  yields  to  a  change  in  official  rates  depends  on  the
conditions in the economy, the economic policies in force and, in particular, on the stance  and
firmness of monetary policy.
The experience of the last few years in financially open economies with exchange
rate  flexibility  between  the  major  areas  confirms  the  effectiveness  of  monetary  policy  in
controlling  inflation.  This,  in  turn,  exerts  an  influence  on  expectations  and  yield  differentials,
and thereby on the level of long-term interest rates.
The  mechanism  is  well  known  in  monetary  theory.  To  the  extent  that  monetary
control  is  effective,  it  is  able  to  influence  inflation  expectations  and  thereby  interest  rate
differentials and hence the nominal yields on long-term securities.
At the beginning of 1995 we announced our intention of raising short-term rates
with the aim of curbing, reversing, the increase in the very high  yields  on  long-term  securities
(Figure 4).
In  the  currency  crisis  of  spring  1995  the  yield  differential  between  long-term
Italian  and  German  securities  widened  to  660  basis  points.  The  budget  adjustment  measures
adopted, the performance of the external accounts and the improvement in inflation expectations
caused the gap to narrow over the rest of the year (Figure 5).
BIS Review   15/1997
- 5 -
In  January  of  last  year  the  yield  differential  with  respect  to  Germany  was  still
around  450  basis  points;  the  more  stable  political  climate  and  the  further  improvement  in
inflation expectations resulted in its narrowing to around 300 basis points at the end of May. The
substantial budget adjustment announced in the autumn of last year, the approval of the Finance
Law for 1997 and the further slowdown in inflation have reduced the differential to around 150
basis points.
As things stand today a reduction in official rates  by  a  country’s  central  bank  is
effective  if  it  is  ratification  of  more  favourable  inflation  expectations.  These,  in  turn,  must  be
rooted in the performance of the public finances and costs. History shows many cases where the
inconsistency of other policies with the objectives has resulted in longer-term rates rising instead
of falling in the wake of an easing of monetary policy.
4. Market participants and the allocation of funds in the international market
The  growing  openness  of  national  financial  systems  has  accelerated  the
development  of  the  market  for  Eurocurrencies,  especially  that  for  cross-border  deposits  and
loans.  Institutional  investors,  banks  and  the  other  participants  in  the  global  market  need  liquid
funds to carry out their financial transactions.
Dollar  deposits  outside  the  United  States  are  equal  to  70  per  cent  of  the  US
money stock. The ratio for the mark is slightly lower at 63 per cent; for the pound sterling and
the French franc it is 13 and 16 per cent respectively.
Following the complete liberalisation of Italian short-term capital movements, in
the spring of  1990  the  Eurolira  market  also  began  to  expand  rapidly.  It  is  now  larger  than  the
corresponding markets for the Swiss franc, the French franc and the pound sterling (Table 7).
At the end of the second quarter of 1996 the  stock  of  Eurolire  amounted  to  340
trillion lire, or 30 per cent of the Italian money stock. London accounts for a major part of this
market.
The mass of lire traded in the international financial market reflects a demand for
financial  transactions  that  focuses  mainly  on  the  secondary  market  for  Italian  government
securities,  though  the  demand  for  Eurolira  bonds  and  derivatives  is  growing.  The  rapid
expansion of this market and the size it has grown to, despite the reduction in yield differentials,
are evidence of market participants’ increased confidence in the lira.
The  last  few  years  have  seen  the  activity  of  institutional  investors  in  the  global
market  grow  at  a  rapid  pace.  At  the  end  of  1995  such  intermediaries  in  the  United  States,
Europe,  Asia  and  Oceania  with  balance  sheets  of  at  least  $10  billion  had  total  assets  of  $21
trillion (Figure 6).
These intermediated funds are equal to about one fifth  of  the  estimated  value  of
the six leading industrial countries’ total financial assets with domestic and foreign counterparts,
and equal to three times the GDP of the United States and twenty times that of Italy.
Institutional  investors  place  the  bulk  of  the  funds  they  raise  in  their  national
markets; they are nonetheless of considerable importance in the international allocation of funds
in view of how they make their investment choices and the scale of their investments.
In Italy, as in other leading countries, a large part of the funds invested abroad by
enterprises and especially households is channelled through such intermediaries. They reallocate
their  resources  according  to  the  importance  of  the  various  economies,  taking  account  of
exchange rate expectations, yields and risks.
BIS Review   15/1997

The  proportion  invested  in  each  country  is  determined  on  the  basis  of  portfolio
optimisation  criteria;  the  amounts  involved  are  large  enough  to  affect  securities  prices  even  in
medium-sized financial markets
At the end of 1995 European institutional investors had raised $7.5 trillion. They
are estimated to have invested 78 per cent of their resources, or $6 trillion, in shares and bonds.
Around $2 trillion, or roughly a quarter of the total volume of intermediated funds, was invested
outside the intermediary’s home country (Figure 7).
The funds raised by US institutional investors amounted to $8 trillion at the same
date and they had invested 80 per cent of the total in shares and bonds, a figure close to that for
European institutional investors. In view of the depth and diversification of the US market, the
greater part of these intermediaries’ resources was invested in domestic securities; nonetheless,
11 per cent, or around $900 billion, was invested in shares and bonds in foreign markets.
Although  institutional  investors  in  Asia  and  Oceania  had  also 
invested
domestically  most  of  the  nearly  $5  trillion  of  funds  they  had  raised  at  the  end  of  1995,  their
international  investments  in  shares  and  bonds  are  nonetheless  estimated  to  have  amounted  to
$400 billion.
Taken  together,  these  institutional  investors  held  more  than  $15  trillion  of
domestic and foreign shares and bonds at the end of 1995, corresponding to around 35 per cent
of the stocks of such instruments issued by the leading industrial countries.
These intermediaries’ investments in shares and bonds issued outside their home
countries exceeded $3 trillion.
The  configuration  of  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates  generated  in  international
markets interacts with the financial variables of national markets In addition to the fundamentals
of each economy, an important role is played by all the information permitting the assessment of
the  authorities’  ability  to  implement  policies  aimed  at  achieving  growth  in  conditions  of
stability.
5. The 1995 currency crisis and the control of inflation
In  the  early  months  of  1995  the  Mexican  crisis  and  the  weakening  of  the  US
dollar prompted substantial and sudden shifts of funds, out of the weaker currencies  into  those
considered to be stronger. In addition to the US dollar, the Canadian dollar, the pound sterling,
the  Swedish  krona  and  the  Spanish  peseta  also  weakened  considerably.  The  lira  was  hit  hard:
between mid-February and mid-March it depreciated by 15 per cent.
The  identification  of  a  currency  as  weak  or  strong  is  linked  to  the  general
conditions  in  the  economy,  notably  as  regards  the  state  of  the  public  finances,  the  external
position and the solidity of the country’s institutions. In the background there are the stability of
the  currency’s  purchasing  power,  competitiveness,  the  outlook  for  economic  growth  and  the
availability of saving and the uses to which it is put.
In  Italy  wage  moderation  made  it  possible  to  avoid  a  cost-price  spiral,  but  the
increase  in  consumer  prices  and  the  depreciation  of  the  lira  caused  a  marked  deterioration  in
expectations. Opinion surveys revealed that a surge in inflation was expected (Figure 8a).
At  the  same  time  as  supplementary  budget  measures  were  adopted  in  February
1995, we raised the official discount rate and the rate on fixed-term advances; in May we raised
them again.
Monetary growth was drastically curbed.
BIS Review   15/1997
- 7 -
At  the  General  Meeting  of  the  Bank’s  shareholders  on  31  May  1995  we
announced the objective of slowing inflation in the second half of the year; we pointed out that it
was both possible and essential to reduce inflation to less than 4 per cent on average in 1996.
Towards  the  middle  of  the  year  inflation  expectations  began  to  improve
significantly (Figure 8a).
Market  yields  on  government  securities  started  to  come  down,  especially  for
longer maturities; the lira strengthened, partly owing to the appreciation of the dollar.
On  31  May  1996,  in  addition  to  confirming  that  the  conditions  existed  for
inflation to fall below 4 per cent in 1996, we stated that it would be possible to achieve a more
ambitious target in 1997: an inflation rate of less than 3 per cent.
Between May and December of last year the average monthly rate of inflation on
an annual basis was close to 2 per cent.
The survey of consumer price expectations carried out last September indicated a
rate of inflation of between 3 and 3.5 per cent in the first quarter of 1997. The survey carried out
in December indicated a rate of between 2.5 and 3 per cent for the first half of this year (Figure
8a).
6. The outlook
After  the  breakdown  of  the  gold  exchange  standard  all  countries’  currencies
became of a purely fiat nature. This is a new epoch in monetary history.
International  capital  movements  tend  to  expand,  with  a  multiplication  of  money
and  credit  at  the  global  level  that  makes  it  increasingly  difficult  for  authorities  to  exercise
quantitative control.
The volume of funds traded, the rapidity with which they can be shifted and the
sensitiveness  of  market  participants  to  economic  and  metaeconomic  information  can  generate
tensions  in  financial  markets  and  influence  the  quotations  of  currencies  and  securities,  with
significant effects on economic activity and prices, even in medium-sized economies.
Greater monetary stability  in  Europe  not  only  benefits  individual  economies  but
also contributes to the solidity of the international financial system.
The weakness of the economic cycle and the curbing of inflation have led to a fall
in interest rates. Easier monetary conditions have been a major factor underlying the rise in bond
and share prices.
Monetary stability, public finances in order and flexible productive structures and
factor  markets  are  necessary  to  protect  individual  economies  from  destabilising  speculative
movements,  to  enable  them  to  share  in  the  benefits  of  the  global  market  and  economic  and
financial integration in Europe.
This  is  the  context  in  which  policies  must  be  implemented  to  permit  the  full
employment of all the available resources of labour, saving and physical capital.
In  the  last  four  years  Italy  has  made  significant  progress  in  re  equilibrating  its
external position, curbing the budget deficit and controlling inflation.
In 1996 the slowdown in inflation permitted a substantial fall in interest rates; the
Treasury’s spending on this item declined in absolute terms, despite the increase of 6 per cent in
the  stock  of  debt.  The  improvement  in  the  budget  deficit  suffered  a  setback,  however.  The
overall  borrowing  requirement  grew  in  absolute  terms  and  remained  unchanged  in  relation  to
GDP  at  7.4  per  cent.  The  supplementary  budget  measures  adopted  in  the  middle  of  the  year
BIS Review   15/1997
- 8 -
failed  to  prevent  a  large  overshoot  on  the  order  of  30  trillion  lire  compared  with  the  original
target set in September 1995.
In the Forecasting and Planning Report published last September the Government
increased the 1997 budget adjustment to 62.5 trillion lire, compared with 37.5 trillion envisaged
in  the  Economic  and  Financial  Planning  Document.  This  is  a  demanding  commitment  that  is
already having beneficial effects on government securities prices and the financial markets.
As I pointed out in my Parliamentary hearing on the Finance Law, the forecasts of
the borrowing requirement in 1997 reflect highly favourable assessments concerning the primary
surplus;  these  are  only  compensated  for  in  part  by  the  significantly  better-than-forecast
behaviour of interest rates.
The  lower  level  of  the  primary  surplus  in  1996,  with  a  shortfall  of  around  20
trillion lire compared with last September’s estimates, will have repercussions on the results in
1997; these will also be affected by the cyclical slowdown that started at the beginning of 1996
and became more pronounced in the last part of the year.
The  adjustment  of  the  budget  deficit  will  have  to  be  pursued  by  curbing  the
growth  in  expenditure.  On  the  revenue  side  it  will  be  necessary  to  reduce  tax  avoidance  and
evasion. Further fiscal tightening would have adverse effects on domestic demand and prices.
In  order  to  create  confidence  in  a  return  to  equilibrium  in  the  medium  term,
budget adjustment measures will have to be of a structural nature.
There is an urgent need to revive growth.
Italy, like many other leading European countries, is far from making full use of
its resources of saving, labour and entrepreneurial ability, with consequent economic and social
costs.
In cyclical terms the level of economic activity remains unsatisfactory.
According to the latest forecasts, the growth in GDP in 1997 will be just over 1
per cent.
The trade surplus will remain large, as will the surplus on the current account of
the balance of payments, thereby contributing to a further improvement in the country’s external
position and providing support for the lira.
It will be necessary to modify the composition of public expenditure, by reducing
that on current account, in order to release the resources needed to return public investment to a
normal level. In the last few years this component has fallen by around one percentage point of
GDP. Investment will need to be directed to the areas and sectors where the shortfall in public
infrastructure is greatest, to the benefit of productivity and, above all, of employment.
The  latest  reduction  in  official  rates,  following  that  enacted  in  1996,  was  made
possible  by  the  improvement  in  both  actual  and  expected  inflation.  Together  with  the  ample
availability of saving, it also creates the conditions for a higher level of private investment.
The fall in market interest rates will be locked in only if permanent price stability
is achieved.
Monetary stability, consolidation of the public finances and economic growth are
three closely interrelated objectives. The experience of recent years shows that failing to achieve
even one of them necessarily jeopardises the other two.
The  establishment  and  maintenance  of  the  virtuous  circle  is  likely  to  be
interrupted  by  the  reappearance  of  inflationary  pressures,  which  can  be  engendered  by  labour
BIS Review   15/1997
- 9 -
costs,  pricing  policies  that  are  short-sighted  and  unresponsive  to  competitive  stimuli,  by  an
insufficient reduction or excessive expansion of the budget deficit.
Monetary policy will  remain  firmly  directed  towards  producing  an  expansion  of
money  and  credit  that  will  permit  balanced  growth  of  the  economy  in  conditions  of  broadly
stable prices.
The rise in the incomes of those already working must not hinder the creation of
employment. A smaller absorption of saving by the public sector will make resources available
for  investment.  These  are  the  conditions  for  removing  the  most  acute,  most  socially
unacceptable, forms of unemployment, which have been aggravated by the events of the last few
years. They will allow a host of young people with qualifications  and  a  desire  to  contribute  to
the development of our economy and society to become active members of the labour force.

(1) The data on the overall external position and that of the banking system are derived from 
     the balance of payments and those on the other items from the financial accounts (stocks are valued 
     at current exchange rates and state sector liabilities are valued at market prices). The amounts under 
     "unallocated items and discrepancies" include the statistical discrepancies between  the  two  systems  of 
     accounts. The assets of the central bank and the liabilities of banks exclude foreign currency swaps.
     The assets and liabilities of banks exclude the components matched by domestic foreign currency
     positions, which are included directly in the figures for the State and private sectors.
