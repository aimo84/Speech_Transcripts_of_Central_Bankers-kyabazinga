Philipp M Hildebrand: Monetary policy and oil prices - a new paradigm? 
Speech by Mr Philipp M Hildebrand, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, to 
the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce Union League Club, New York, 18 November 2004. 
 Introduction 
1. 
The rapid rise in oil prices since the beginning of 2004 brings painful memories of the global economic 
consequences of the oil shocks during the 1970s. Crude oil prices reached a nominal all-time-high of 
55 USD per barrel WTI at the end of October. The current 46 USD mark is comparable to the previous 
all time nominal price peak in 1979.  
Apart from similar nominal oil price levels, today’s macroeconomic conditions are very different from 
those of 1970s. Presently, inflation rates are low throughout much of the world. Inflation expectations 
are  generally  well  anchored.  Central  banks  have  proven  their  commitment  to  price  stability.  In  real 
terms, the current spot price for crude oil is nowhere near the peak levels of the late 1970s. Moreover, 
during  the  last  thirty  years,  developed  economies  have  become  substantially  less  dependent  on  oil 
(see Figure 1). 
The 1970s are not an appropriate model for today’s economic environment. Nonetheless, recent oil 
price developments have been remarkable. Since 2000, the average price of light, sweet crude oil has 
been  around  30  USD.  This  is  significantly  higher  than  the  average  price  level  of  18  USD  between 
1986 and 1999. Even if one adjusts these prices for inflation, the difference remains substantial. While 
not  establishing  a  statistically  reliable  trend,  these  figures  provide  at  least  tentative  support  to  the 
hypothesis of an upward level shift in the equilibrium price range of oil (see Figure 2). 
For  a  central  bank  concerned  with  maintaining  price  stability,  it  is  important  to  examine  such  a 
hypothesis in some detail. My remarks today will initially focus on a number of factors that support the 
equilibrium price level shift argument. I will then briefly examine to what extent information extracted 
from the oil market confirms the hypothesis of a persistent level shift in oil prices. Finally, I will discuss 
how  higher  oil  prices  affect  aggregate  output  and  inflation  and  consider  their  consequences  for 
monetary  policy  with  a  brief  reference  to  the  current  economic  situation  and  monetary  policy 
challenges in Switzerland. 
Oil price level shift hypothesis 
2.  
Demand and supply of oil are strongly affected by increasing global integration. Throughout the 1980s, 
the  relationship  between  oil  prices  and  economic  output  was  characterized  by  a  largely  one-way 
causal  effect  from  oil  prices  to  economic  growth.  Today,  the  opposite  dynamic  appears  to  have 
become  more  relevant.  The  demand  for  oil  and  the  price  of  oil  is  increasingly  a  function  of  global 
economic  developments.  In  other  words,  an  increase  in  the  price  of  oil  can  be  viewed  as  a 
consequence  associated  with  an  acceleration  of  global  economic  growth.  A  simple  statistical 
calculation  provides  evidence  of  a  structural  break  in  the  relationship  between  world  GDP  and  the 
price of oil in 1995. Before 1995, the correlation between GDP and oil prices was –0.4. During the 
period 1995 to 2004, the correlation stands at +0.3 (see Figure 3). 
Against this backdrop, economic developments in China play a crucial role. The integration of China 
into the world economy is likely to be a historic event. Indeed, its long-term economic consequences 
strike me as comparable to those associated with the integration of the emerging U.S. economy into 
the world economy at the end of the 19th century. China has become the second largest importer and 
consumer of oil behind the United States. The longer-term oil demand effect associated with Chinese 
growth is potentially vast. The fact that China is poor in natural resources undoubtedly strengthens the 
Chinese authorities’ resolve to avoid any potential energy shortages. The International Energy Agency 
IEA estimates that global demand for oil will increase by 2.5 million barrels per day or in excess of 
3% this year. This represents the highest increase in global demand for oil during the past quarter of a 
century. Virtually half of that increase in demand can be attributed to the Asian emerging markets with 
China  accounting  for  over  32%  of  the  additional  demand.  Needless  to  say,  China  is  merely  at  the 
beginning of its growth dynamic. Even if we assume that the Chinese growth path will not be linear

and  that  with  time,  Chinese  corporations  and  households  will  use  energy  more  efficiently,  buoyant 
demand for oil is likely to remain a dominant feature of the Chinese economy. 
On  the  supply  side,  the  oil  market  has  always  been  highly  sensitive  to  political  risk.  Potential 
geopolitical risks in the most important producer nations have, however, dramatically increased after 
9/11 and the war in Iraq. Moreover, geopolitical uncertainty is not restricted to the Middle East. Political 
developments in Venezuela, Nigeria and Russia have all adversely affected the oil market. Compared 
to previous times of heightened geopolitical tension, the global political landscape appears particularly 
prone  to  protracted  uncertainty  with  regard  to  productive  capacity,  existing  supplies,  as  well  as 
transportation  facilities  of  oil.  Even  if  further  terrorist  attacks  can  be  avoided,  the  current  climate  of 
far-reaching geopolitical uncertainty is likely to exert upward pressure on oil prices. 
Low oil inventories in the U.S. and elsewhere also provide support for the hypothesis of a persistent 
upward shift in prices. U.S. inventories are slowly recovering from a 30-year record low (see Figure 4). 
Initial  inventory  restocking  efforts  may  exacerbate  upward  price  momentum.  As  long  as  inventories 
remain low, the industrial sector remains in a vulnerable position and is thus willing to pay up despite 
high prices. Here  too, China  plays an important  role.  The  demand  for  oil  in China  appears  to have 
been greatly underestimated by oil producers. If the developed countries had rebuilt inventories as late 
as  the  1990s,  the  effect  on  prices  would  have  likely  been  more  modest.  Low  inventories  and  the 
demand explosion coming out of China have been a potent combination in support of higher oil prices. 
Going forward, an easing of inventory pressure is likely. However, assuming global demand remains 
robust,  inventory  rebuilding  is  unlikely  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  fundamental  supply  and 
demand structure of the oil market in the short term. 
Inadequate investment spending in production, refinery and transportation infrastructure over the past 
decade  is  another  factor  frequently  used  in  support  of  the  hypothesis  of  a  persistent  level  shift  in 
average  oil  prices.  Available  industry  figures  suggest  that  both  new  as  well  as  replacement 
investments  have  been  insufficient  to  support  a  substantial  increase  in  oil  production.  Significant 
investments are required to turn heavy, sour crudes with high sulphur content and high density into 
ever more demanded light, sweet quality grades (see Figure 5). If the market is allowed to function, 
higher  oil  prices  and  higher  quality  spreads  will  in  time  encourage  drilling,  refinery  and  shipping 
investments  which  will  eventually  contribute  to  higher  output.  Politics  could,  however,  impede  this 
process. Investment decisions in many oil producing countries have become intensely politicized. The 
absence  of  important  oil  producing  countries  from  WTO  underlines  the  need  for  a  more  productive 
climate  for  international  investments.  It  might  therefore  be  overly  optimistic  to  expect  the  market  to 
generate an immediate incentive to boost oil related investment spending. 
Beyond  these  demand  and  supply  driven  factors  in  support  of  a  price  level  shift  hypothesis,  the 
growing  importance  of  oil  as  a  financial  asset  class  is  an  additional  factor  to  consider.  Beginning 
around the time of the bursting of the technology bubble in the spring of 2000, the futures market for 
oil became a relatively sought after financial asset class. Increasingly accommodating global monetary 
conditions throughout much of the world economy may well have facilitated this process. This asset 
allocation shift is reflected in a marked increase in the liquidity of oil futures contracts together with 
upward  trending  prices  (see  Figure  6).  There  is  some  evidence  that  hedge  funds  have  been 
particularly active in the oil futures market. In a recent study, the BIS notes a high correlation (0.8) 
between the weekly oil price changes and changes in long positions of non-commercial traders of oil 
futures.1 Market estimates suggest there could be a single digit dollar per barrel speculative premium 
on the oil price.2  
What does market tell us? 
3.  
Oil  price  development  in  the  past  decade  has  been  characterized  by  short-term  spikes  in  the  spot 
price ranging from 11 to 40 USD per barrel for WTI crude. Meanwhile, futures prices remained well 
anchored around 20 USD per barrel. The recent run-up in oil spot prices however was part of a shift of 
the entire curve. Market estimates of the long-run marginal cost of oil nearly doubled and now stands

at 35 USD per barrel for WTI delivery in 5 years (see Figure 7). Moreover, despite the most recent 
sharp  correction  in  spot  prices  from  55  to  46  USD  per  barrel  WTI,  long-dated  futures  prices  have 
receded only marginally. Since 2002, prices of oil futures are generally quoted below expected spot 
prices  -  a  state  labeled  backwardation.  Backwardation  implies  uncertainty  about  production  and 
supplies  and  effectively  favors  further  inventory  draw  downs  (see  Figure  8).  Price  information 
extracted from the market appears to confirm that at least for the time being, average oil prices are 
likely to remain elevated compared to historical price ranges. 
Forecasting market prices is an inherently difficult endeavor. Immense uncertainties on the supply side 
make  oil  price  forecasts  particularly  challenging.    Reserve  figures  can  be  increased  rapidly  by  the 
discovery of new oil fields or by exploitation at greater margins due to new technologies. Proven oil 
reserves in the Middle East, for example, increased from 16 billion barrels in 1944 to 116 billion barrels 
of meanwhile extracted or still available reserves in 1975. In 1984, 200 additional barrels were added 
to  the  proven  reserves  in  the  Middle  East,  which  now  stand  at  685  billion  barrels  out  of  a  total  of 
roughly one trillion barrels worldwide.3  
Despite  great  difficulties  of  forecasting  oil  prices,  monetary  authorities  cannot  shy  away  from 
considering different hypotheses. In essence, central bankers have to think about risk and probability 
weighted scenarios. As I have tried to demonstrate, there is considerable evidence suggesting that oil 
prices may not rapidly revert to previous average price ranges. The future could, of course, turn out 
differently. Supply elasticity tends to be underestimated, sometimes dramatically so. Indeed, in the late 
1970s,  oil  prices  were  projected  to  rise  substantially.  As  we  now  know,  market  forces  prevailed. 
Supply  was  increased  and  prices  eventually  fell.  Nonetheless,  from  today’s  vantage  point,  the 
hypothesis of a level shift in the equilibrium price range of oil strikes me as plausible. Moreover, given 
the importance of oil prices to the overall dynamic of the global economy, we need to consider the 
likely  impact  of  higher  oil  prices  on  aggregate  output  and  inflation  and  what  it  means  for  monetary 
policy. 
Impact on output and inflation  
4. 
Oil prices affect the economy through different transmission channels. In the short term, an oil price 
shock adversely affects aggregate demand. A rise in the price of oil resembles an excise tax and leads 
to a loss of purchasing power. In the medium term, higher oil prices lead to higher production cost and 
a reduction in the rate of return on capital. In the long term, the oil price shock leads to diminished 
investments and a reduction in the capital stock.  
Different  models  and  differing  assumptions  about  the  reaction  function  of  monetary  policy  imply 
varying output consequences. In March 2004, the OECD used their macroeconomic model to simulate 
a permanent increase in oil prices of 10 USD from the then price of 25 USD to 35 USD. The effect 
impacted  the  OECD  economy  within  a  year  with  a  reduction  in  output  of  0.4%  and  an  increase  in 
inflation of 0.5%. At the Swiss National Bank, we are conducting similar simulations, including more 
pessimistic ones. To date, our results have not deviated substantially from those of the OECD.  
Different  countries  respond  differently  to  oil  shocks.  There  are  winners  and  there  are  losers.  A 
country’s vulnerability is essentially a function of its oil reserves and its oil intensity. The winners of an 
oil shock are net exporters. The losers are net oil importers. In a perfect equilibrium model, one could 
imagine a world in which the net output loss in oil importing countries is offset by the output gain in oil 
exporting  countries.  Empirically,  the  petrodollar  transfer  induced  wealth  gain  in  exporting  countries 
does not appear to fully compensate aggregate demand losses in importing countries. 
The oil intensity of the Indian and the Chinese economy is substantially higher than that of the U.S. 
economy which in turn is still higher than that of the European or the Swiss economy. On the other 
hand,  the  U.S.  is  less  dependent  on  oil  imports  than  the  European  Union,  let  alone  Switzerland. 
Structural characteristics of  an economy  can  also affect  the  economic  impact  of  an oil  price shock. 
Rigid  labor  markets,  for  instance,  can  lead  to  asymmetric  effects  on  output.  The  output  loss  in  the 
event of a rise in oil prices can exceed the output gain in the event of a corresponding decline in oil 
prices. It is generally assumed that the overall impact of an oil shock is somewhat less pronounced in 
the U.S. than in Europe. Finally, exchange rates can play a role. As a result of the substantial decline

in  the  U.S.  dollar  against  most  non-Asian  currencies,  the  recent  increase  in  the  price  of  oil  in  local 
currency has been less pronounced in Europe.  
For a central bank concerned with maintaining price stability as the bedrock condition for sustained 
economic development, the crucial question is how a level shift in the equilibrium price range of oil 
would impact longer-term inflation rates. 
Oil prices have a direct impact on inflation because the price of crude oil immediately impacts gasoline 
and heating oil prices. The inflation effect depends on the weight of oil based products in the CPI. In 
Switzerland,  heating oil  makes  up 1.2%  of  the  CPI.  Total  oil  based products  represent  3.8%  of  the 
CPI.  In  the  United  States,  energy  commodities  represent  3.5%  of  the  CPI,  while  total  energy  is 
weighted with 7.1%. 
Traditionally, changes in oil prices fed through to the Swiss CPI slowly.  A survey of the data between 
1984 and 1996 reveals that oil prices and the CPI were still positively correlated after two years. Since 
1997,  a  change  in  oil  prices  seems  to  affect  the  CPI  more  rapidly.  The  transmission  is  virtually 
complete after a mere six to twelve months. While the speed of the pass through from oil prices to the 
CPI  has  nearly  doubled,  the  magnitude  of  the  transmission  has  declined  (see  Graph  9).  Integrated 
global capital  and goods markets  have  increased  competition and  led  to  a  generalized  reduction  in 
pricing  power.  In  a  fiercely  competitive  environment,  producers  find  it  difficult  to  transfer  higher  oil 
prices  to  consumers.  Ongoing  competitive  pressures  and  further  globalization  constitute  barriers  to 
incorporating higher oil prices in the price- and wage-setting behavior. A credible central bank with a 
long-term record of price stability is an additional key parameter ensuring that higher oil prices do not 
spill over into elevated longer-term inflation expectations.  
Given the rapid pass through from changes in the price of oil to the CPI, headline inflation figures are 
subject to frequent base effect related distortions. As a result, various core inflation measures become 
more  important.  These  reflect  the  longer-term  price  dynamics  in  an  economy.  In  the  event  of  an 
adverse oil price shock, a good core inflation measure will only rise by the amount of second round 
effects on other goods prices.  
There  are  effectively  two  transmission  channels  from  a  rise  in  headline  to  a  rise  in  core  inflation. 
Higher headline inflation can adversely affect longer-term price expectations. Rising headline inflation 
can therefore give rise to expectations of higher prices across the board. Alternatively, consumers can 
attempt to compensate their oil price related purchasing power losses by demanding higher wages. 
Such consumer behavior can trigger adverse wage- and price-setting behavior which would require a 
response from monetary policy authorities in an effort to preserve price stability.  
Monetary policy implications 
5.  
The response of monetary policy to oil shocks is therefore a function of the extent to which higher oil 
prices feed through to higher core inflation rates. In the event of a mere spike in headline inflation in 
the aftermath of an adverse oil price shock, it would be unwise for a central bank to force a reduction 
in aggregate demand to lead headline inflation back to its target. Instead, the appropriate policy stance 
is to “look through” the temporary rise in headline inflation. On the other hand, a central bank must 
remain vigilant and look out for possible signs of second round effects from a rise in oil prices.  
Despite high and volatile oil prices, there are few signs of underlying inflationary pressures building up 
in the world economy so far. CPI and PPI core inflation rates remain contained and wage growth is 
moderate,  both  in  the  U.S.  as  well  as  in  Europe.  Moreover,  despite  near-record  global  economic 
growth in 2004, there are substantial unutilized capacities in the U.S., Japan, and Europe. As a result, 
despite record oil prices a few weeks ago, global inflation expectations appear to be well anchored. 
The  growth  outlook  for  Switzerland  remains  constructive,  supported  by  an  expansionary  monetary 
policy  stance.  The  rise  in  oil  prices  has,  however,  dampened  domestic  demand.  Weakness  in 
Germany and, more recently, in France are exacerbating the situation. Economic growth is unlikely to 
accelerate  into  2005.  Upward  pressure  on  the  exchange  rate  may  exert  additional  unwelcome 
downward pressure on aggregate demand. Some slack in Swiss labor and product markets is likely to 
prevail. The output gap will close in 2006 at the earliest. In such an environment, it will take time for 
the  unemployment  rate  to  decline  from  the  current  3.7%.  Real  wage  growth  is  well  contained  with 
growth  rates  fluctuating  around  1%  per  year  since  2001.  Core  inflation  rates  remain  moderate  at 
around  1%.  Despite  substantially  higher  oil  price  related  CPI  and  PPI  inflation  since  August  of  this 
year,  longer-term  inflation  expectations  remain  firmly  anchored  as  swap  spreads  and  consensus 
4 
 BIS Review 69/2004
forecasts  confirm.  The  growth  rates  of  Swiss  monetary  aggregates  and  the  development  of  credit 
confirm the overall picture of a moderate inflation outlook.  
The key challenge for monetary policy authorities - in Switzerland and elsewhere - will be to continue 
to firmly anchor these longer-term inflation expectations. As I mentioned earlier, notwithstanding high 
oil  prices,  circumstances  are  favorable.  Price  stability  has  been  all  but  achieved  in  much  of  the 
developed  world.  Even  developing  countries  are  enjoying  relatively  low  and  stable  inflation  rates. 
Various  forms  of  credible  monetary  policy  frameworks  are  anchoring  future  inflation  expectations. 
Higher oil prices appear to feed through to higher headline inflation more rapidly than in the past but 
the  magnitude  of  the  effect  appears  to  have  declined.  Finally,  the  world  economy  is  hardly 
overheating. Indeed, judging by the OECD’s global leading indicator, the recent growth momentum is 
abating. Moreover, to the extent that the recent oil price shock is to a significant extent demand driven, 
dampening  global  growth  will  at  least  to  some  extent  be  self-stabilizing  with  regard  to  underlying 
inflation pressure. 
Compared to the time of the last great oil shock in the late 1970s, monetary authorities operate under 
a different paradigm to the extent that they can afford to “look through” what are likely to be temporary 
spikes  in  headline  inflation  associated  with  what  is  likely  to  be  a  demand  driven  level  shift  in  the 
equilibrium price range of oil. Indeed, in some cases, monetary policy may find itself in a position to be 
able to respond to the output loss associated with higher oil prices. “Looking through”, however, must 
not be confused with being complacent. As Fed Governor Gramlich has stated in a recent speech on 
oil shocks and monetary policy, the worst possible outcome for monetary policy makers would be “to 
let inflation come loose from its moorings”.4 Central banks will remain vigilant in their examination of 
longer-term  inflation  expectations.  The  Swiss  National  Bank,  for  one,  would  promptly  react  if  there 
were  any  indications  in  its  quarterly  inflation  forecast  that  second  round  effects  were  likely  to 
undermine its long-term track record of maintaining price stability in support of maximum sustainable 
economic growth.
