Philipp M Hildebrand: Current monetary policy situation and economic 
prospects 
Speech by Dr Philipp M Hildebrand, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at 
“Finanzinstitute Thurgau bei der Universität Konstanz”, Kreuzlingen, 26 April 2004. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 Due to the vigorous monetary and fiscal policy stimuli from the US, the global economy is expanding 
again. In Switzerland, too, the upswing has become a reality. In the current year, the Swiss National 
Bank (SNB) is expecting growth of 1.5% - 2%, which slightly exceeds the present growth potential. 
Since  capacity  utilisation  is  still  fairly  modest,  such  economic  growth  does  not  bring  an  immediate 
threat of inflation for Switzerland at the moment. The downward risks still existing therefore justify a 
cautious monetary policy. In order to be able to ensure price stability in the medium term, the SNB 
must, however, bring its expansionary monetary policy back on normal course again as soon as the 
economic recovery sets in and capacity utilisation improves markedly.
