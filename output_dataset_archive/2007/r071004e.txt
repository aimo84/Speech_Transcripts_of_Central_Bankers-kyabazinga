Philipp M Hildebrand: The role of central banks in fostering economic 
development 
Speech  by  Mr  Philipp  M  Hildebrand,  Vice-Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Swiss 
National Bank, at the Inaugural Meeting of the Africa Emerging Markets Forum, Gerzensee, 
1 October 2007. 
The  speaker  gratefully  acknowledges  the  valuable  assistance  provided  by  Raphael  Auer,  Martin  Brown  and 
Werner Hermann in preparing this speech. 
 Introduction 
1.  
On behalf of my Governing Board colleagues, let me warmly welcome you to the SNB Study 
Center Gerzensee! It is an honour and a privilege for the Swiss National Bank to host the 
Inaugural Meeting of the Emerging Markets Forum for Africa.  
I trust you are well rested this morning. By now, you will have noted that the Study Center 
Gerzensee  is  not  a  five  star  hotel.  Compared  to  other  conference  centres,  the  service 
provided here is modest. We like to think that we emphasise substance rather than style. We 
try to create an atmosphere conducive to learning. The Center serves multiple purposes. It is 
here,  for  example,  that  we  organise  advanced  courses  for  selected  central  bank 
professionals from all over the world. According to the traditional policy of the Center, only 
one participant per country is allowed in each Central Bankers Course. In the 25 years since 
the  creation  of  the  Center,  more  than  300  participants  from  African  central  banks  have 
attended these courses. We therefore like to think that the Study Center Gerzensee make a 
humble  contribution  to  integrating  African  central  banks  into  the  global  central  banking 
network.  
The EMF has chosen to come to Gerzensee to address the challenges that emerging Africa 
is facing. Undoubtedly, these challenges are enormous. In recognition of the importance of 
this gathering, the SNB is proud to host your deliberations. The EMF and the Swiss National 
Bank share the view that private investment is ultimately the driver of sustained economic 
growth  and  poverty  reduction.  However  –  and  I  think  that  we  would  again  agree  –  public 
policy  matters  a  great  deal.  It  does  so  primarily  by  providing  a  sound  macroeconomic 
environment,  by  improving  financial  markets,  and  by  strengthening  property  rights  and 
institutions.  
Institutional weakness has, of course, received much attention in the recent past. Every year, 
the World Bank’s Doing Business Report points out the same three main obstacles to private 
investment activity in Africa: a massive bureaucratic burden, widespread corruption, and the 
resulting high cost of doing private business. 
Other  areas  of  public  policy  that  aim  to  promote  economic  activity  generally  receive  less 
attention. The fight against red tape and corruption is unquestionably important. But progress 
in  macroeconomic  and  structural  policy  should  not  be  overlooked.  As  a  central  banker,  I 
would like to take this opportunity to review progress in those areas which are related to the 
activity  of  monetary  authorities.  I  believe  that  the  three  following  core  activities  of  central 
banks  can  have  a  substantial  impact  on  the  environment  for  doing  business:  maintaining 
price  stability,  maintaining  a  safe  and  efficient  payment  system,  and  supporting  the 
development of the financial sector. 
Price stability  
2.  
Let us first consider price stability. Low and stable inflation rates allow the private sector to 
plan for the future, lead to a lower need for costly price adjustments, prevent tax distortions

and thus create a stable business environment. On the other side, high and unstable inflation 
creates  random  wealth  transfers  between  creditors  and  debtors.  Since  their  fiscal  base  is 
weak, governments in Africa have often relied on seignorage to improve their income stream, 
creating  high  inflation  rates  as  a  by  product.  How  has  inflation  developed  throughout  the 
continent in recent years? 
Figure 1 depicts inflation in Africa from 1990 to 2005. It displays inflation in South Africa, as 
well as the median inflation rates in 39 other sub-Saharan economies and in 5 North African 
economies. I focus on the median inflation rate because this measure is not sensitive to large 
outliers such as Zimbabwe. As you can see, inflation in Africa has trended downward over 
the past 15 years, with the exception being the aftermath of the Tequila crisis in 94/95. In 
South  Africa  and  northern  Africa  inflation  is  now  well  below  5%,  while  sub-Saharan  Africa 
also displays single digit inflation rate.

The figures displayed suggest that businesses and households in most African countries now 
enjoy an environment of increasingly stable prices. Undoubtedly, the recent inflation record 
has  contributed  to  the  increasingly  robust  growth  environment.  Figure  2  shows  that  per 
capita growth has picked up in recent years in parts of Africa. This is particularly true where 
disinflation was strongest.

Governments no longer seem to rely on money printing as a revenue source. This is a sound 
policy  development  which  encourages  private  sector  activity.  Going  forward,  the  challenge 
for African central banks will be to maintain this recently acquired track record.  
 Payment systems 
3.  
Next let’s look at the payment system. The development of the payment system determines 
how easy it is for firms and consumers to access and transfer money. Can businesses pay 
their  suppliers  by  writing  a  cheque  or  making  an  electronic  transfer?  Or  do  they  have  to 
undergo the cumbersome and insecure process of sending cash physically? Can households 
pay for consumer goods with debit cards, cheques or credit cards, or do they have to carry 
significant amounts of cash with them? Can workers in urban areas transfer money to their 
rural  families  by  simply  sending  an  SMS,  or  do  they  have  to  carry  it  with  them  on  a 
dangerous bus ride?  
Particularly in Africa, where distances are vast and security is often a concern, the availability 
of  non-cash  payment  instruments  can  increase  the  returns  to  economic  activity  for 
businesses and households. Figure 3 shows that today, most economies in Africa are still 
strongly cash based. Both in sub-Saharan and northern Africa, more than one-third of funds 
available  for  immediate  payments  are  in  cash  form.  The  notable  exception  is  South  Africa 
where the level of non-cash money is above 80%, and thus similar to that of Switzerland. 
Developments  over  the  past  15  years  show  a  promising  picture  for  other  countries  on  the 
continent  as  well.  Since  1995,  the  share  of  non-cash  money  has  increased  from  50  to  60 
percent  in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  and  55  to  65  percent  in  North  Africa.  This  mirrors  the 
increased availability of electronic payment instruments available to businesses, but also to 
households.

 How  can  central  banks  foster  the  further  development  of  safe  and  efficient  payment 
instruments  in  Africa?  First  and  foremost,  central  banks  must  take  a  leading  role  in  the 
development,  operation  and  oversight  of  necessary  infrastructure,  such  as  interbank  and 
retail payment systems. In doing so, it would seem natural to take advantage of international 
knowledge and expertise. As financial sector regulators, central banks can further create a 
market  environment  which  encourages  the  entry  of  new  service  providers,  as  well  as  the 
development of innovative payment instruments, such as SMS-banking and mobile-banking. 
As an oversight authority, it is then the task of the central bank to ensure that new payment 
services adhere to the security requirement desired by businesses, households and financial 
institutions.  
Financial sector development 
4.  
Third, let’s take a brief look at financial sector development. An efficient and deep financial 
sector  provides  enterprises  with  debt  and  equity  to  finance  their  growth,  thus  spurring 
economic  activity.  At  the  same  time  a  deep  financial  sector  can  provide  households  with 
savings  and  credit  products  to  smooth  their  consumption  patterns,  again  increasing  their 
return from economic activity, and reducing poverty.  
To what extent have financial sectors grown and become more efficient in Africa in recent 
years?  Figure  4  displays  the  volume  of  private  credit,  as  a  percentage  of  GDP,  for  South 
Africa, other sub-Saharan countries and for Northern Africa. With credit exceeding GDP, the 
financial  sector  in  South  Africa  boasts  a  similar  size  to  that  of  many  North  American  and 
European  countries.  By  contrast,  the  financial  sector  is  very  shallow  in  the  rest  of  sub-
Saharan Africa, with credit volumes at less than 20% of GDP. Even more worrying is that the 
financial sector has hardly deepened over the past 15 years.

Continuing this undoubtedly bleak picture, we see that the financial sector in sub-Saharan 
Africa  has  become  neither  more  efficient,  nor  more  competitive  in  recent  years.  Figure  5 
displays  the  nominal  rates  at  which  banks  lend  money,  as  well  as  the  rate  they  pay  for 
deposits. Lending rates have stayed more or less constant from 1993 to 2005. Since inflation 
has  decreased  substantially  over  this  time,  the  real  interest  rate  that  banks  charge  has 
actually  increased.  By  contrast,  the  nominal  deposit  rate  has  decreased,  so  that  the  real 
deposit rate has been constant. Together this implies that the interest rate spread charged 
and earned by banks has increased substantially in the last 15 years.

What can African central banks do to foster deeper and more efficient financial sectors? In 
most African countries, central banks are responsible for regulating and supervising banks. 
Here  central  banks  should  ensure  that  regulatory  requirements  are  not  prohibitive  for  new

market entrants, particularly foreign financial institutions who may bring cheaper capital and 
new  technology  to  the  sector.  Moreover,  central  banks  can  foster  the  development  of 
sustainable microfinance and rural financial institutions to cater to the vast agricultural and 
microenterprise sector. They can do so by adopting regulatory requirements which suit the 
limited sphere of activity of these institutions. 
Conclusion 
5.  
Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude these brief introductory remarks. How can we assess 
the  contribution  of  central  banks  to  improving  the  business  environment  in  Africa?  Most 
African  central  banks  have  been  successful  in  reducing  inflation.  This  enables  the  private 
sector  to  plan  ahead  and  engage  in  contracts  without  worrying  excessively  that  their 
proceeds may be eroded by rapidly rising inflation. 
Central banks have also fostered improvements in the payment system, which have reduced 
the  costs  of  accessing  and  transferring  money  for  businesses  and  households.  The  cash 
intensity  of  most  African  economies  suggests,  however,  that  there  is  still  room  for 
improvement in this area. A greater challenge for central banks lies in fostering growth and 
efficiency  in  the  financial  sector.  The  banking  sector  in  many  countries  of  the  continent 
remains small and sadly displays a low level of efficiency and competition.  
I  sincerely  hope  that  this  Forum  will  contribute  to  finding  solutions  to  these  and  other 
challenges to emerging Africa. Let me close by wishing you a successful EMF here at the 
Study Center Gerzensee.
