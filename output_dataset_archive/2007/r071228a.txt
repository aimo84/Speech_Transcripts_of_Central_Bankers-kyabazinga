Jean-Pierre Roth: The position of the Swiss franc exchange rate in the 
Swiss National Bank monetary policy strategy 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the 
Swiss  National  Bank  and  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Bank  for  International 
Settlements, at the University of St. Gallen, St. Gallen, 19 December 2007. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 The  exchange  rate  is  an  important  factor  in  determining  the  domestic  price  level  in 
Switzerland. Nevertheless, it is not a monetary policy goal for the Swiss National Bank and is 
only  relevant  insofar  as  it  has  an  impact  on  future  inflation.  Our  concerns  about  our 
currency's weakness should not be read as a hidden form of exchange rate policy but rather 
as  genuine  concern  about  future  price  stability.  A  sustained  tendency  to  weakness  on  the 
part of the Swiss franc could trigger inflationary effects that – sooner or later – would have to 
be countered with monetary policy instruments taking the form of interest rate measures. In 
the  medium-term,  this  could  lead  to  a  reduction  in  the  interest  spread  between  the  Swiss 
franc and the euro.
