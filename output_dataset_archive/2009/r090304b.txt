Jean-Pierre Roth: Impact of the global crisis on Switzerland 
Introductory remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss 
National Bank, at the Schweizerisch-Deutscher Wirtschaftsclub, Frankfurt am Main, 2 March 
2009. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 What  started  as  a  financial  crisis  has  now  become  a  global  economic  crisis.  Although  the 
Swiss economy was in a very sound state before the crisis set in, Switzerland’s standing as a 
financial centre, its real economy and its public finances have all been strongly affected by 
the  global  turmoil.  Recovery  will  depend  largely  on  the  development  of  the  US  economy. 
Despite  having  reached  worldwide  proportions  by  now,  the  crisis  was  not  triggered  by 
globalisation itself. Rather, it is the result of a lack of discipline in the industrialised nations. 
Monetary policy today must contribute to the stabilisation of the financial system and the real 
economy without losing sight of its principal task, which is to maintain price stability.
