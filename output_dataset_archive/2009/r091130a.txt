Jean-Pierre Roth: As the financial crisis recedes, what are the lessons 
for central bank efforts in the future? 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the 
Swiss National Bank, at the Centre International d’Etudes Monétaires et Bancaires, Geneva, 
24 November 2009. 
The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 The  financial  crisis  of  the  last  two  years  has  caused  people  to  re-examine  a  number  of 
generally accepted ideas. Corrective measures are being undertaken, particularly in the area 
of banking regulation. For central banks, the most delicate issue will be how to contribute to 
macrofinancial  stability  without  jeopardising  their  objective  of  price  stability  and,  in  turn, 
compromising their own credibility.  
As  regards  banking  supervision,  close  cooperation  between  central  banks  and  banking 
supervisory  authorities  is  essential.  The  temptation  to  concentrate  forces  is  strong.  In 
Switzerland, placing centralised oversight responsibility with the Swiss National Bank would 
risk weakening the SNB’s independence from the political sphere. 
With respect to systemically important financial institutions, everything possible must be done 
to  limit  the  likelihood  and  the  risks  of  further  problems.  Major  efforts  are  underway  in  this 
regard at the Financial Stability Board. 
To  ensure  that  central  banks  have  the  necessary  means  to  act  in  a  crisis,  a  liberal  legal 
framework and a safety cushion in the form of equity are needed. The SNB is in a favourable 
position in this respect.
