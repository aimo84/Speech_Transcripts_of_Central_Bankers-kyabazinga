Jean-Pierre Roth: No frontiers in monetary policy – from the fight to 
avoid internationalisation of the currency to the internationalisation of 
monetary policy   
Speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Swiss  National 
Bank, at the Swiss Institute of International Studies, Zurich, 6 May 2009.  
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 In  view  of  the  challenges  with  which  it  has  been  faced,  the  Swiss  National  Bank  (SNB) 
demonstrated  its  adaptability  time  and  again.  Over  the  past  thirty  years,  for  instance,  it 
abandoned its endeavours to prevent the use of the Swiss franc as an international currency. 
Moreover,  it  has  gradually  incorporated  international  elements  into  its  monetary  policy 
strategy and its monetary policy instruments. The goal when making these adjustments was 
always to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy in order to protect the country from 
any  inflationary  trend.  In  managing  the  current  crisis,  both  the  internationalised  monetary 
policy strategy and the internationalised policy instruments have served the SNB well thus 
far.
