Durmuş Yılmaz: Recent economic and financial developments in Turkey 
Speech by Mr Durmuş Yilmaz, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at 
the press conference for the presentation of the Inflation Report, Ankara, 30 April 2009. 
 Distinguished Guests and Members of the Press, 
Welcome to the press conference for the presentation of the April 2009 Inflation Report, one 
of the most important communication tools of the inflation-targeting regime. 
The  report  typically  elaborates  global  and  domestic  macroeconomic  developments  and 
presents  the  medium-term  inflation  forecasts  revised  in  line  with  the  previous  quarter 
developments.  It  also  presents  six  boxes  examining  the  recent  monetary  policy  decisions 
and the relevant economic developments.  
Now,  I  would  like  to  give  you  a  short  summary  of  our  evaluations  and  the  Central  Bank’s 
revised inflation forecasts in the Inflation Report, which will be posted on the CBT website 
today. 
Inflation developments 
1.  
Distinguished Members of the Press, 
The world economy has been undergoing a period dominated by dynamics quite unlike to 
those  of  previous  years.  With  the  loss  of  confidence  resulting  from  the  on-going  financial 
crisis, the global economy entered a significant contraction trend after a long period of time. 
Impacts of the crisis on real economic activity deepened in the first quarter of 2009. Thus, 
inflationary  pressures,  which  were  perceived  as  a  major  concern  until  the  last  quarter  of 
2008, were overtaken by fears of deflation in developed countries in the first quarter of 2009. 
In  this  context,  I  would  like  to  start  my  speech  by  once  more  underlining  that  inflation 
developments in Turkey in the first quarter of 2009 should be considered in the light of these 
global conditions. 
In the first quarter of 2009, consumer prices increased by 1.05 percent and annual consumer 
inflation  became  7.89,  remaining  within  the  limits  of  the  uncertainty  band.  Backed  by  the 
significant slowdown in economic activity and improvement in cost-based effects, the decline 
in  inflation  gained  ground  and  spread  across  all  subgroups.  In  addition,  the  short-term 
exchange rate pass-through on consumer prices remained limited in the previous quarter. 
The  contribution  of  all  main  groups  excluding  tobacco  and  gold,  which  posted  high-rated 
price hikes to annual inflation weakened in the first quarter of the year. While the contribution 
of  food  and  energy  to  annual  inflation  decreased  especially  due  to  the  marked  decline  of 
annual  inflation  in  energy  prices,  the  contribution  of  services  prices  also  continued  to 
diminish owing to the fall in costs and the slowdown in domestic demand (Figure 1).

In the first quarter, the increase in food prices lost pace over previous years in response to 
the significant slowdown in the processed food group and energy prices dropped owing to 
the lagged effects of the recent decline in oil prices. Goods prices excluding food and energy 
slumped  by  a  lower  margin  over  the  first  quarter  of  the  previous  year.  The  slowdown  in 
services prices became more pronounced (Figure 2).

The  unprocessed  food  group  posted  monthly  price  hikes  of  significant  levels  in  the  last 
quarter  of  2007  and  the  first  half  of  2008  on  account  of  production  losses  and  cyclical 
developments all over the world. Annual inflation in this group surged to 25 percent. With the 
reversal  of  these  effects  since  the  second  half  of  2008,  the  downward  trend  in  annual 
inflation of this group gained pace in this quarter (Figure 3). Meanwhile, the downward trend 
in the annual rate of increase in food prices is expected to continue in the second quarter as 
well.

Esteemed Guests, 
I would like to further clarify the developments related to services prices as I deem it helpful 
to  focus  on  them  to  better  understand  the  significant  downturn  in  the  underlying  trend  of 
inflation. Services inflation, which had remained relatively elevated in the first three quarters 
of 2008 due to the second round effects of energy and food prices, has eased considerably 
since  the  last  quarter  of  2008  following  the  sharp  contraction  in  aggregate  demand.  The 
cumulative rate of change in services prices during first three months of 2009 was merely 
0.53 percent on lower costs and weaker domestic demand, which is the lowest percentage 
recorded in the 2003 based CPI index’s history.  
The slowdown in the growth rate of services prices has spread across all services subgroups 
(Figure  4).  The  lagged  effects  of  dips  in  international  oil  prices  had  a  favorable  impact  on 
transport  services  in  the  first  quarter.  Rental  price  movements  remained  quite  below  the 
averages  of  previous  years  due  to  the  contraction  of  domestic  demand.  The  prices  of  the 
restaurants and hotels group also followed a similar course owing to shrinking demand and 
decelerating food prices (Figure 5). I would particularly like to draw attention to the decrease 
of  annual  rent  inflation.  Seasonally  adjusted  data  point  to  a  continual  and  accelerating 
downward trend in rents in the first quarter of the year. The slowdown in services prices is 
expected to continue in the upcoming period as well.

The first quarter saw a significant decline in the prices of durables excluding gold (Table 1). 
While the said decline was mainly driven by the SCT (Special Consumption Tax) reduction 
on  automobiles,  white  goods  and  electronic  products  to  be  effected  for  a  limited  period  of 
three  months  from  March  onwards,  automobile  prices,  by  displaying  sharp  decline,  were 
chief determinants in prices of this group. The favorable effect of these reductions started to 
be observed on the domestic sales of automobiles and household goods in March (Figure 6). 
Moreover, the temporary VAT cut on furniture and IT products for a three-month period will 
have a short-term restraining effect on annual inflation in durables. Nevertheless, the lagged 
effects of the exchange rate pass-through on the prices of durable goods are expected to be 
partially seen following the depletion of current inventories.

Core inflation indicators displayed a continual and accelerating downward trend in the first 
quarter  of  2009.  The  CPI  index  excluding  energy,  unprocessed  food,  alcoholic  beverages, 
tobacco products and gold fell by 2.66 percentage points year-on-year, while, with a further 
exclusion  of  processed  food,  the  index  dropped  by  1.41  percentage  points  year-on-year. 
Even  though  the  SCT  cut  in  the  second  half  of  March  was  also  influential  in  this 
development, the ongoing decline in the seasonally adjusted rates of change in both indices 
points to a continuing downward trend in inflation (Figure 7).

As  I  mentioned  at  the  beginning  of  my  speech,  economic  stagnation,  which  grew  more 
widespread in late 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, accompanied by the fall in international 
commodity prices has led to a significant decline in global inflation. As illustrated in the slide, 
the  downward  trend  in  consumer  price  inflation  in  developed  markets  became  more 
pronounced, while inflation in emerging markets lost ground significantly.  
Annual consumer price inflation in developed markets declined from 4.4 percent in July 2008 
to  0.7  percent  in  February  2009.  Concurrently,  consumer  price  inflation  in  emerging 
economies dropped from 9.9 percent to 6.4 percent as of the same period (Figure 8 and 9).

Monetary policy response  
2.  
Distinguished Members of the Press, Dear Guests, 
After making brief remarks on inflation developments, now I would like touch on the policies 
pursued by the Central Bank in this period. 
As I mentioned earlier in my speech, the first quarter of 2009 is characterized as a period 
where impacts of the global financial crisis on the real economy were felt more clearly and 
inflationary pressures that dominated a major part of 2008 have been overtaken by fears of 
deflation  and  growth.  With  the  effect  of  commodity  price  declines  and  slumps  in  domestic 
economic  activity  since  mid-2008,  inflation  in  Turkey  took  a  sharp  plunge  in  this  period. 
Waning  inflationary  concerns  have  allowed  the  Central  Bank  to  focus  on  restraining  the 
potentially devastating effects of the crisis on the Turkish economy  without conflicting with 
our primary objective of maintaining price stability. Considering the policies that have been 
implemented since the second half of 2008 within this context assumes great importance.  
Recent data point to an ongoing slowdown in economic activity of the first quarter of the year. 
Although domestic demand showed signs of a limited recovery over the previous quarter, it 
still maintains its weak course. Labor market data also indicate that this downward trend will 
continue  and  that  it  will  take  some  time  for  economic  activity  to  recover.  Slumps  in 
commodity prices and the significant slowdown in foreign demand in this period also add to 
the downward trend of inflation. Within this framework, the Central Bank adopted a strategy 
of front-loading policy easing by cutting overnight rates by a total of 700 basis points from 
November 2008 to April 2009 (Table 2).

Benchmark bond rates came down significantly driven by the policy rate cuts and the partially 
easing  tensions  in  global  financial  markets  (Figure  10).  Moreover,  the  signal  given  by  the 
Central Bank for possible necessity of maintaining downward flexibility for a long period of 
time coupled with moderate recovery in risk perceptions contributed to the decline in market 
interest rates.

Distinguished Guests, 
The  financial  crisis  that  erupted  in  the  markets  of  developed  countries  deepened  starting 
from  September  2008,  influencing  the  global  financial  system  as  a  whole.  This  led  to 
tremendous hikes in the risk premia of developing countries. In general, countries with low 
credit ratings end up with more apparent deterioration in risk premia, whereas the opposite 
applies to Turkey. In this period, being among developing countries having the lowest credit 
ranking, the decline in Turkey’s risk premium was somewhat limited. In other words, Turkey’s 
risk premium has resisted the deterioration in global risk perceptions more than is implied by 
her credit rating, thus clearly differing it from other developing countries in terms of the risk-
premium-credit rating relationship (Figure 13). This indicates that traditional criteria used in 
determining credit rating and credit risk level may remain inadequate for accurately reflecting 
actual credit risk levels of countries at the times during which country specific characteristics 
come to the forefront.

Countries that experienced a decline in their risk premia enjoyed room for policy rate cuts in 
the  period  of  deepening  financial  crisis  (Figure  14).  In  this  period,  contrary  to  many 
developing countries, the foreign exchange indebtedness of households in Turkey remained 
at  low  levels.  This  factor,  accompanied  by  the  resilience  of  the  financial  system  and  the 
restricted  deterioration  in  risk  premia  during  the  global  financial  crisis,  allowed  the  Central 
Bank of the Republic of Turkey to opt for policy rate cuts of large amounts.

Distinguished Guests, 
The measures taken against the global financial crisis were not limited to policy rate cuts. In 
this  period,  a  lot  of  countries  not  only  take  measures  to  regulate  the  functioning  of  the 
markets,  but  also  exercise  non-traditional  monetary  policy  implementations.  In  this  period, 
the  Central  Bank  of  Turkey  also  took  measures  against  the  potential  adverse  effects  on 
financial  stability,  a  prerequisite  for  price  stability.  In  the  first  quarter  of  2009,  a  counter-
cyclical monetary policy was adopted in the money market on the one hand and a number of 
decisions  were  made  to  regulate  the  Foreign  Exchange  and  Banknotes  Markets-Foreign 
Exchange  Deposit  Market  on  the  other  hand.  In  this  framework,  the  maturity  of  foreign 
exchange deposit borrowed by the Banks from the Central Bank was extended; the lending 
rate for transactions, which the Central Bank is a party to, was reduced and the maturity of 
interbank transactions in the said market was extended. Besides, foreign exchange selling 
auctions were held at the times of ailing price movements in the foreign exchange market. In 
addition to these measures, the conditions for the Liquidity Support Facility offered to banks 
under extraordinary conditions were revised. 
Now,  I  would  like  to  once  more  underline  that  if  problems  in  international  markets  further 
deepen  and  adversely  affect  domestic  financial  markets,  the  Central  Bank  will  continue  to 
take additional measures and to employ other policy instruments.  
Esteemed Guests, 
Inflation  expectations  displayed  a  downward  trend  in  the  first  quarter  of  2009  in  line  with 
decelerating  inflation.  As  the  incoming  information  on  inflation  and  economic  activity 
confirmed  our  forecasts  and  vindicated  the  CBT’s  monetary  policy  decisions,  inflation 
expectations also responded favorably following a low course in the second quarter of 2009.

Though inflation expectations for every term fall compared to the previous Inflation Report 
period, the decline in short-term inflation expectations appears to be more evident since April 
2009 (Figures 15 and 16).

Inflation and monetary policy outlook  
3.  
Distinguished Guests, 
After summarizing inflation and monetary policy developments in the first quarter of 2009, in 
this part of my speech, I would like to share with you the evaluation of the Central Bank of 
Turkey about the inflation outlook and monetary policy in the upcoming period. I will also add 
the Central Bank’s inflation forecasts presented in the Inflation Report, which is to be posted 
on our website soon. Firstly, I will briefly touch on the economic framework underlying these 
forecasts. 
In spite of all the measures taken to alleviate its effects on the financial system and economic 
activity, no clear indication yet to signal that the global crisis is coming to an end. Within this 
context, challenges regarding the emerging markets’ access to global capital still persist and 
the  risk  premium  indicators  of  these  countries  remain  highly  elevated  despite  the  limited 
rebound observed at the end of the first quarter of 2009 (Figure 17).

In the first quarter of 2009, the Turkish lira did not widely differentiate from the currencies of 
other developing countries in terms of changes in value. Having said that, the relatively low 
level  of  volatility  in  the  Turkish  lira  –  one  of  the  currencies  with  the  highest  volatility 
historically and susceptibility to the global risk appetite – became more evident in 2009, the 
year during which the distinctive characteristics of the countries came to the forefront (Figure 
18).

The expectation that the global capital squeeze will not end in the upcoming period indicates 
that the potential pressure on the exchange rates of developing countries may persist. 
Tightness  in  financial  conditions  continued  in  the  first  quarter  of  the  year.  Prolonged 
uncertainties pertaining to the global economy accompanied with deceleration in economic

activity kept the banks’ lending appetite at low levels. The elevation in credit risk, the decline 
in foreign financing facilities and the short maturity of deposits urged banks to be cautious in 
terms  of  credit  supply  and  curbed  the  decline  in  credit  interest  rates.  In  spite  of  a  limited 
rebound  in  credits  recently,  we  believe  there  is  little  chance  for  this  move  to  become  a 
permanent recovery as long as the global economy is not stabilized (Figure 19).

Distinguished Members of the Press, 
In the first quarter of 2009, the sharp contraction in global economic activity and its larger 
than anticipated impact on domestic activity called for a downward revision of the outlook for 
aggregate demand developments from the previous reporting period. In the January Inflation 
Report, economic activity was expected to display a significant decline in the last quarter of 
2008, while it was anticipated that the speed of contraction would start to lose pace during 
the  first  quarter  of  2009.  In  line  with  expectations,  the  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP) 
displayed a sizeable drop in the last quarter of 2008 on a quarterly and on an annual basis 
(Figures 20 and 21). Recent readings suggest that economic activity will display a sharper-
than-envisaged slowdown and that the contraction in the economy in the first quarter of the 
year will register double-digit figures. This development was the main reason underlying the 
downward revision in the outlook for inflation and monetary policy in the last three months.

An analysis of Gross Domestic Product developments in terms of output in the last quarter of 
2008 reveals that all the subcomponents except those of the agriculture sector contributed 
negatively  to  growth.  A  comparison  of  this  financial  crisis  with  that  in  2001  points  to  a 
similarity between not only the Gross Domestic Product growth rate, but also the composition 
of  production  sectors  (Figure  22).  On  the  other  hand,  making  the  said  comparison  also  in 
terms  of  expenditures  is  crucial  considering  the  projections  pertaining  to  the  timing  of  the 
possible rebound in economic activity. To this end, we believe that it will be useful to exclude 
the  quarterly  additional  contribution  of  public  expenditures  in  the  last  quarter  of  2008  and 
focus on other components. Firstly, excluding public sector demand, the difference in growth 
in the two periods compared exhibits a fairly unfavorable outlook for the last quarter of 2008. 
The relatively high depletion in inventories in this period compared to that in 2001 reveals the 
relative  strength  of  the  aggregate  demand  shock  and  the  sharpness  of  the  downturn  in 
capacity  utilization  rates.  Moreover,  the  differentiation  in  private  consumption  demand  and 
net  exports  performance  indicates  a  rather  lower  contraction  of  domestic  demand  besides 
the adverse effect of the global shock on net foreign demand in the current period (Figure 
23).

Turkey’s  export  performance  has  become  more  vulnerable  to  global  cyclical  changes  in 
recent years as the share of durables and capital goods in our exports has increased over 
time.  In  fact,  the  significant  slowdown  in  our  major  trading  partners  and  the  consequent 
contraction  in  exports  were  among  the  determinants  of  the  sharp  downturn  in  aggregate 
demand. Therefore, the assumptions on the global economy with respect to the inflation and 
monetary policy outlook presented in the Inflation Report that will be posted on our Website 
shortly are very important. 
The impact of the global financial turmoil in the corporate sector has become more evident 
and  global  growth  has  significantly  contracted.  The  credit  crunch  in  international  credit 
markets  still  persists  and  there  is  yet  to  be  a  notable  improvement  in  global  economic 
indicators.  Our  baseline  scenario  in  the  January  Inflation  Report  envisaged  a  gradual 
recovery  in  the  global  economy  as  of  early  2010.  On  the  back  of  the  deepening  global 
financial  turmoil  in  the  past  period,  many  international  institutions  revised  their  growth 
forecasts for 2009 and 2010 downwards by a significant margin (Table 3). The forecasts for 
global  economic  activity,  which  were  revised  in  the  last  three  months,  indicate  a  sharper 
contraction for 2009 compared to our forecasts presented in the January Inflation Report and 
a slower and more gradual recovery throughout 2010. Within this framework, compared to 
the previous report, the revised forecasts are based on a deeper contraction in 2009, and a 
global recovery that will be visible by mid-2010, rather than at the beginning of 2010. I would 
like to clarify that the word “recovery” in this Report refers to “a significantly positive growth in 
economic activity in year-on-year terms”.

The contraction in economic activity in the last quarter of 2008, which was mainly driven by 
the contraction in the export-oriented industrial sector, accelerated the deterioration in non-
agricultural  employment  and  unemployment  climbed  to  a  record  high  with  the  additional 
effect of the significant rise in the labor force participation rate (Graph 24 and 25). The most 
recent  data  indicate  that  the  rise  in  the  unemployment  rate  continued  with  further 
acceleration in the first quarter of 2009. Within this framework, it is estimated that the current 
conditions will continue to curb the upward trend in unit labor costs and the rise in domestic 
demand.

The rapid policy rate cuts coupled with the fiscal stimulus plan designed to revive domestic 
economic  activity  are  expected  to  underpin  domestic  demand  as  of  the  second  quarter  of 
2009.  As  I  have  mentioned  earlier  in  my  speech,  reaching  lasting  stability  in  the  global 
economy will take time and therefore, no notable recovery is expected in domestic economic 
activity in the short run. Within this framework, aggregate demand conditions are expected to 
continue to support disinflation for some time (Graph 26). In sum, compared to the January 
Inflation Report, the revised inflation forecasts are based on increased favorable contribution 
from aggregate demand conditions to disinflation.

The problems in global economy and tighter credit conditions still persist. Following recent 
financial  measures  and  policy  rate  cuts,  domestic  demand  is  expected  to  gain  a  relatively 
stable trend in the second quarter of 2009 and growth is expected to generate positive rates 
as of the final quarter of 2009. Meanwhile, considering the current global economic outlook, it 
16 
 BIS Review 67/2009
is estimated that access to foreign financing facilities will remain limited for a while, economic 
agents  will  continue  their  cautious  stance  and  no  significant  pick-up  will  be  observed  in 
aggregate  demand  in  the  short  run.  Moreover,  when  the  sharp  decline  in  non-agricultural 
employment  is  taken  into  account,  it  is  estimated  that  the  level  of  disposable  income  will 
remain low for a while and the precautionary saving tendency will continue to curb domestic 
demand.  Within  this  framework,  we  believe  that  the  recovery  in  economic  activity  will  be 
gradual and the downward pressures on inflation will continue.  
Despite the downward revision in the outlook for economic activity, there have been no major 
developments  that  require  revising  the  oil  and  food  price  assumptions  stated  in  the  past 
Report. Therefore, the forecasts have been based on a framework in which oil prices would 
hover around USD 55 per barrel throughout the forecast horizon. The previous assumptions 
for oil prices at 55 USD per barrel, and food inflation of 7.5 percent for 2009 and 6 percent 
thereafter are maintained. 
Distinguished Members of the Press and Dear Guests, 
In line with the framework that I have presented so far and based on the assumption that 
there will be measured policy rate cuts in the short run and after that policy rates will be kept 
constant for a while, our revised forecasts suggest that with 70 percent probability, inflation 
will be between 4.8 percent and 7.2 percent (mid-point 6.0) at the end of 2009, and between 
3.5 percent and 7.1 percent (mid-point 5.3) at the end of 2010. We expect inflation to come 
down to 4.9 percent by the end of 2011 (Graph 27).

*Indicates a 70-percent confidence interval for the forecast 
 
To  sum  up,  the  sharp  weakening  in  aggregate  demand  has  not  only  led  to  faster-than-
envisaged rate cuts, but has also required a downward revision in the medium-term inflation 
forecasts.  The  revised  forecast  suggests  that  the  recent  rate  cuts  have  lowered  the 
probability  of  significantly  undershooting  the  end-year  inflation  target.  However,  given  the 
tightness  in  financial  conditions  and  the  absence  of  clear  signs  of  recovery  in  the  global 
economy,  it  may  be  necessary  for  monetary  policy  to  maintain  an  easing  bias  for  a 
considerable period. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or information regarding the inflation outlook may 
lead to a change in monetary policy stance. Therefore, I would like to repeat once again that 
BIS Review 67/2009 
 17
the  assumptions  on  future  policy  rates  underlying  the  inflation  forecast  should  not  be 
perceived as a commitment on behalf of the Central Bank of Turkey. 
Risks and alternative scenarios  
4.  
Distinguished Members of the Press, 
I would like to devote the last part of my speech to the risks to monetary and inflation policy 
in  the  upcoming  period,  as  well  as  the  alternative  projections  that  we  mentioned  in  our 
Inflation Report within this framework.  
Currently, developments in the global economy are influencing the monetary policy outlook 
via  credit  channels  and  portfolio  flows  as  well  as  via  the  foreign  trade  channel.  As 
uncertainties regarding the global economy still persist, assumptions pertaining to the timing 
and  magnitude  of  recovery  are  still  important,  as  was  the  case  in  the  January  Inflation 
Report. 
As you will recall, in the January Inflation Report, three different scenarios were presented 
based on the depth of economic contraction and the timing of recovery: (i) baseline scenario, 
(ii) early recovery and (iii) late recovery, and the medium-term inflation forecasts were based 
on these scenarios. In this Report, the “early recovery” scenario was dropped because global 
economic  growth  forecasts  were  continuously  revised  downwards.  Therefore,  the  final 
chapter of the April Inflation Report contains only one alternative scenario that is compared 
with  the  baseline.  In  the  alternative  scenario,  it  is  assumed  that  the  global  crisis  will  grow 
deeper  and  recovery  in  global  activity  will  start  at  the  beginning  of  2011.  In  this  scenario, 
commodity  prices  are  envisaged  to  go  below  the  assumptions  presented  in  the  baseline 
scenario; credit conditions are projected to remain tight for a while and recovery in foreign 
demand  would  be  a  prolonged  and  slower  process  due  to  the  late  recovery  in  the  global 
economy. Meanwhile, crude oil prices are projected to drop to USD 45 per barrel and remain 
at this level throughout the forecast horizon. This projection is above the one presented in 
the January Inflation Report, as OPEC announced that it would not allow sharp falls in oil 
prices. Meanwhile, it is foreseen that food prices inflation would remain below the baseline 
scenario and therefore will become 5.5 percent by the end of 2009 and 5 percent afterwards.  
Against this background, assuming that measured policy rate cuts continue throughout 2009, 
it is projected that with 70 percent probability, inflation will be between 3.9 and 6.5 percent 
with a mid-point of 5.2 percent at the end of 2009, and between 2.7 and 6.3 percent with a 
mid-point of 4.5 percent at the end of 2010. Furthermore, inflation is expected to go down to 
4.2 percent by the end of 2011. To sum up, these forecasts indicate that in the case of a 
longer-than-expected slowdown in global economic activity, inflation would remain below the 
medium-term  forecasts  even  if  the  measured  policy  rate  cuts  continue  throughout  2009 
(Graph 28).

Distinguished guests, 
The  developments  in  fiscal  policy  are  another  major  factor  that  may  affect  the  outlook  for 
inflation and monetary policy. Recently, budget revenues have been declining in line with the 
slowdown  in  economic  activity.  Meanwhile,  expenditures  have  been  rising  due  to  the 
counter-cyclical fiscal policy that was put into practice to mitigate the adverse effects of the 
global crisis on domestic economic activity, leading to a significant rise in the budget deficit. 
Probable  adjustments  in  excise  taxes  and/or  administered  prices  in  order  to  stabilize  the 
budget could cause some volatility in inflation over the short term. Moreover, higher financing 
requirement  of  the  government  might  weaken  the  favorable  impact  of  monetary  policy 
decisions  and  the  fiscal  measures  on  economic  activity.  Therefore,  in  order  to  reap  gains 
from the short-term expansionary fiscal policy, it is important to commit to a credible medium-
term fiscal framework that would ensure fiscal discipline and debt sustainability.  
Uncertainties regarding the magnitude of the impact of problems in global financial markets 
on the real economy still persist. The CBT will continue to take the necessary measures to 
contain  the  adverse  effects  of  global  financial  turmoil  on  the  domestic  economy,  provided 
that  they  do  not  conflict  with  the  price  stability  objective.  Prudent  monetary  policy  is 
necessary but not sufficient to maintain the resilience of the economy in the face of the global 
crisis. Therefore, strengthening the commitment to fiscal discipline and the structural reform 
agenda is also critical to facilitate expectations management and to support the effectiveness 
of  monetary  policy  decisions.  In  this  respect,  the  commitment  to  the  European  Union 
accession process, and timely implementation of the structural reforms envisaged in the Pre-
Accession Economic Program remain to be of the utmost importance. I would like to state 
that,  with  respect  to  macroeconomic  stability  and  price  stability,  we  closely  monitor 
developments regarding structural reforms intended to enhance the quality of fiscal discipline 
and to ensure sustainability of productivity gains. Thank you very much for your attention.
