Durmuş Yilmaz: Press conference for the presentation of the Inflation 
Report  
Speech by Mr Durmuş Yilmaz, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at 
the press conference presenting the third issue of the Inflation Report, Central Bank of the 
Republic of Turkey, Ankara, 29 July 2009. 
 Distinguished Guests and Members of the Press, 
Welcome to the press conference to convey the main messages of the July 2009 Inflation 
Report, one of the most important communication tools of the inflation-targeting regime. 
The  report  typically  summarizes  the  economic  framework  addressed  in  monetary  policy 
decisions, elaborates global and domestic macroeconomic developments and presents the 
medium-term  inflation  forecasts,  which  have  been  revised  in  view  of  the  previous  quarter 
developments, along with the monetary policy stance.  
As you know, in the summary of Monetary Policy Committee Meeting published yesterday 
we  pointed out  that  global  interest rates  are  likely  to  remain  at  low  levels  for  an  extended 
period,  given  the  significant  slowdown  in  growth  and  the  increase  in  saving  rates.  We 
therefore specified that this view should be emphasized more forcefully to align market yields 
closer with future policy intentions. 
In this framework, as a result of our evaluations with Committee members, we agreed that it 
would  be  possible  to  provide  more  solid  information  regarding  the  policy  stance  in  the 
upcoming Inflation Report. Before presenting this information to you, I would like to give you 
a  summary  of  recent  developments  related  to  the  factors  affecting  global  and  domestic 
inflation.  
Inflation developments 
1.  
Distinguished Members of the Press, 
The second quarter of 2009 was marked by persistence of the adverse effects of the global 
financial crisis that erupted in developed markets and then spread across the world during 
the last quarter of 2008. In this period, economic activity maintained its weak course despite 
the  counter-cyclical  effects  of  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  implemented  extensively  in  a 
coordinated  manner  at  global  level  so  as  to  remedy  the  excessive  shortage  of  liquidity  in 
markets.  While  recent  data  releases  on  the  global  financial  system  and  economic  activity 
indicate  that  the  worst  may  be  over,  improvements  in  leading  indicators  have  been  slow, 
problems in credit markets linger, and employment remains in a precarious state, suggesting 
that the recovery will be anemic and protracted. 
The sharp contraction in aggregate demand and the fall in commodity prices since the last 
quarter of 2008 has led to plummeting inflation rates all over the world. In Turkey, a similar 
trend has also been observed in the said period and CPI inflation has edged down to 5.73 
percent over the last three quarters. Thus, as of June, inflation remained at 6.8 percent, well 
below the lower limit of the uncertainty band set around the target path (Figure1).

In addition to the sharp contraction in aggregate demand; the fall in commodity prices and 
temporary tax cuts within the scope of fiscal measures were also instrumental in the sharper-
than-expected drop in inflation. The fall in commodity prices specifically led to a more-than-
anticipated decline in annual processed food and energy inflation. The fall in annual inflation 
has  reached  approximately  19  percentage  points  for  processed  food  prices  and  25 
percentage  points  for  energy  prices  since  October  2008,  when  the  effects  of  the  turmoil 
started to prevail (Figure 2 and 3).

BIS Review 103/2009
In this period during which the effects of the economic contraction on inflation became more 
pronounced,  annual  inflation  declined  in  all  main  groups  excluding  food  (Figure  4).  The 
constant  slowdown  in  the  rate  of  increase  in  services  prices  continued  amid  weakening 
domestic demand. Price hikes in the goods group excluding food and energy remained low 
compared to previous years, which is attributable to the temporary tax cuts (Figure 5).

The  annual  rate  of  increase  in  services  prices  declined  further  in  the  first  half  of  the  year 
amid weakening cost pressures and also because of the lagged effects of the contraction in 
domestic demand. It is worth noting that annual inflation in services decelerated across all 
subcategories (Figure 6). Services prices are expected to edge further down in the coming 
months.

As I believe that it is essential to decouple movements of the core inflation indicators and the 
likely effects of tax cuts to better understand the underlying trend of inflation and to evaluate 
developments more effectively, I would like to further clarify these developments. 
By the end of the second quarter of 2009, annual inflation measured by the CPI excluding 
energy, unprocessed food, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and gold (H index) declined to 2.31 
percent  while  annual  inflation  measured  by  the  I  index,  which  excludes  processed  food 
prices, dropped to 2.98 percent. Although tax cuts contributed significantly to the decline of 
the  core  inflation  indicators,  figures  corrected  for  tax  adjustments  also  confirm  that  the 
underlying trend of inflation is downwards, as illustrated in the slide (Figure 7).

Parallel  to  these  developments,  while  the  fall  in  near-term  inflation  expectations  became 
more  pronounced,  medium-term  expectations  have  posted  a  limited  decline  and  the 
expectations  curve  has  flattened  over  the  last  three  months  (Figure  8  and  9).  Currently, 
expectations for end-2009 are anchored at 6.09 percent, well below the target. On the other 
hand, end-2010 inflation expectations, calculated by averaging inflation expectations for 12- 
and 24-months ahead remain consistent with the target at 6.5 percent.

Distinguished Members of the Press,  
As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, current global conditions play an instrumental 
role in inflation developments. Inflation rates have plummeted since the second half of 2008 
due to downward pressures arising from demand and cost conditions. This downward trend 
also prevailed in the second quarter of 2009 (Figure 10 and 11). The trend of consumer price 
inflation  in  developed  markets  turned  negative  in  May/June  2009  and  dropped  to  –0.56 
percent in June. Consumer price inflation in emerging markets also continued to lose ground 
to  become  4  percent  in  June.  In  other  words,  inflation  rates  started  to  post  a  significant 
downward trend globally from the last quarter of 2008 onwards.

Monetary policy response 
2. 
After  making  brief  remarks  on  inflation  developments,  I  would  now  like  to  touch  on  the 
policies pursued by the Central Bank in this period.  
Anticipating that inflation would decrease sharply following the last quarter of 2008, when the 
global  financial  crisis  deepened,  the  Central  Bank  of  Turkey  (CBRT)  has  focused  on 
alleviating  the  harsh  impact  of  the  global  financial  crisis  on  the  domestic  economy  and 
financial stability. Throughout this process, the CBRT has delivered sizeable cuts in short-
term  interest  rates,  while  providing  liquidity  support  to  financial  markets  by  following  a 
countercyclical monetary policy. In this respect, considering the weak course of demand, the 
ongoing  tightness  in  lending  conditions  and  the  improvement  in  the  inflation  outlook,  the 
Central Bank continued the policy rate cuts, which started in November 2008, in the second 
quarter 2009 as well. Thus, total policy rate cuts reached 850 basis points by July (Table 1).

The  proper  analysis  of  global  trends  and  country-specific  risk  perceptions  bears  great 
significance in establishing a better understanding of recent monetary policy decisions. With 
the  global  spillover  effect  of  the  crisis  as  of  the  last  quarter  of  2008,  central  banks  of 
emerging markets opted for policy rate cuts above expectations with a view to restricting the 
negative  effects  of  the  global  crisis  on  economic  activity.  In  this  period,  countries  with 
relatively stable financial markets and lower deterioration in risk premia had more room for 
maneuver in their monetary policy implementations enabling them to make larger policy rate 
reductions. Raised awareness regarding the relative soundness of Turkey’s financial system 
in this period, coupled with the expected decline in inflation, set the ground for rapid and bold 
rate cuts. Acting accordingly, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey lowered policy rates 
more  than  any  other  emerging  market  central  bank  operating  within  an  inflation  targeting 
framework (Figure 12).

Data  releases  on  inflation  and  economic  activity  since  the  inception  of  the  cycle  of  rate 
cutting  and  the  favorable  course  of  risk  indicators  have  vindicated  these  preemptive 
monetary policy decisions and strengthened the impact of policy decisions on expectations, 
gradually  bringing  market  interest  rates  down  to  historically  low  levels  (Figure  13).  The 
Central Bank assesses that the decline in market interest rates is also attributable to policy 
rate  reductions,  as  well  as  maintaining  flexibility  in  interest  rate  decisions  in  favor  of  a 
downward bias and the recovery in risk perceptions in the second quarter of 2009.  
The downward trend in market interest rates also reverberated on medium term real interest 
rates causing real market interest rates to go down compared to the first quarter and to follow 
a course below the levels of the pre-crisis period (Figure 14). Notwithstanding the fact that a 
decline  in  real  interest  rates  in  periods  of  stagnation  is  an  anticipated  change  in  healthy 
economies,  I  would  like  to  underline  that  this  has  never  been  witnessed  in  the  Turkish 
economy before. In this regard, the current level of real interest rates is considered to be a 
favorable development as it verifies that the Turkish economy is on the path of normalization.

However,  the  Central  Bank  considers  that  market  interest  rates  do  not  properly  reflect  the 
current stance of the monetary policy and statements, and that yield curves should be more 
horizontal compared to the current situation (Figure 15). In this regard, the proper monitoring 
and correct understanding of the monetary policy perspective by economic agents, which I 
will now go on to explain, bears great significance.

Inflation and monetary policy outlook 
3.  
Distinguished Guests, 
Having  summarized  inflation  and  monetary  policy  developments  in  the  second  quarter  of 
2009, in this part of my speech, I would like to share with you the evaluation of the inflation 
outlook  and  monetary  policy  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Turkey  in  the  upcoming  period.  In 
addition,  I  will  also  outline  the  Central  Bank’s  inflation  forecasts  presented  in  the  Inflation 
Report,  which  is  to  be  posted  on  our  website  shortly.  Firstly,  I  will  briefly  touch  on  the 
economic framework underlying these forecasts. 
In  spite  of  widespread  views  that  the  recovery  in  the  global  economy  will  be  slow  and 
gradual,  perceptions  that  the  worst  of  the  crisis  is  over  led  to  optimism  in  global  financial 
markets  in  the  second  quarter  of  the  year  and  an  increase  in  risk  appetite.  Parallel  to  the 
recovery  in  global  risk  perceptions,  the  risk  premia  of  emerging  markets  fell  rapidly  and 
reached almost pre-crisis levels (Figure 16). As was the case throughout the crisis, the risk 
premium of Turkey followed a relatively lower path compared to other emerging markets.

In terms of changes in currency values, the Turkish lira did not significantly differ from other 
emerging  market  currencies.  However,  the  relative  fall  in  the  volatility  of  the  Turkish  lira, 
which  had historically  high  volatility  and  extreme  sensitivity  to  the  global  risk  appetite,  has 
become more evident in 2009, when countries’ own experiences began to unfold following 
the worst period of the crisis (Figure 17).

On the other hand, the currencies of emerging markets that implemented policy rate cuts of 
larger  amounts  also  performed  better  in  the  second  quarter  of  the  year,  as  was  the  case 
during the entire process of the crisis. This owes its existence to the fact that changes in the 
risk  premia  of  countries  during  the  crisis  are  determinants  of  not  only  exchange  rate 
performance but also monetary policy decisions of the said countries.  
As of the second quarter of the year, policy rate reductions have become partially influential 
on domestic credit markets. The marked decline in interest rates on loans extended to firms 
is particularly striking (Figure 18). This has reduced the cost of credits of firms with faltering 
cash  flow,  which  they  utilize  to  restructure  their  debts.  Thereby,  the  deterioration  in  the 
BIS Review 103/2009 
 11
financial  structures  of  such  firms  was  limited  and  a  permanent  damage  to  the  production 
capacity  of  the  economy  was  averted.  Against  the  rapid  decline  in  interest  rates  on  loans 
extended to the corporate sector, fixed and long term loan interest rates still remain high. As 
a matter of fact, term premia in consumer loans are at relatively high levels and particularly 
the fall in interest rates on long term loans remains relatively limited (Figure 19).

While  the  Gross  Domestic  Product went  down  by  13.8  percent  in  the  first  quarter of  2009 
compared  to  the  same  period  of  2008,  seasonally  adjusted  data  indicated  that  contraction 
intensified in this period (Figure 20 and 21). Despite the relative soundness of the Turkish 
financial  sector,  the  contraction  in  economic  activity  became  more  severe.  What  underlies 
this  consequence  is  the  composition  of  exports,  mainly  of  products  sensitive  to  foreign 
conjuncture; susceptibility of production to global credit conditions and Turkey’s high capacity 
level  at  the  onset  of  the  crisis.  During  this  period,  besides  the  tightness  in  financial 
conditions, a sharp contraction in domestic demand was also experienced due to spreading 
perceptions of uncertainty and increasing precautionary saving tendency. In this context, the 
downside contribution of aggregate demand conditions to inflation increased evidently.

An  analysis  of  national  income  developments  in  terms  of  production  in  the  first  quarter  of 
2009 reveals that value added has decelerated in all sectors on an annual basis. Parallel to 
the  sharp  contraction  in  industrial  activity,  value  added  in  the  services  sector  became  the 
component contributing most-negatively- to growth (Figure 22). On the other hand, making 
the said comparison in terms of expenditures, besides the sharp contraction in private sector 
demand,  the  negative  contribution  of  stock  change  is  remarkable.  In  this  period,  the 
contribution of net exports to growth went up due to the sharp deceleration in imports. Public 
expenditures,  as  you  can  see  on  the  slide,  restricted  the  fall  in  domestic  demand  with  a 
contribution of approximately 1.2 points to growth (Figure 23).

Uncertainties in demand conditions driven by the global turmoil lead firms to adopt a cautious 
approach regarding production activities. In this context, the low capacity utilization rates and 
the weak course of propensity to invest continue to limit employment conditions. In the first 
quarter of 2009, with the accelerating slowdown in economic activity, the negative course of 
the  labor  market  intensified  in  comparison  with  the  previous  quarter,  and  the  increase  in 
unemployment  rates  continued,  also  due  to  the  increase  in  labor  force  participation  rates 
(Figure 24).

Recent data include signs of partial recovery in domestic demand conditions and economic 
activity in line with the policy rate cut cycle, accompanied by the financial measures (Figure 
25). However, the negative effects of uncertainties in aggregate demand and low capacity 
utilization rates on investments and employment are expected to last in the upcoming period 
as well. Besides, high levels of unemployment are expected to restrict private consumption 
expenditures.  In  addition  to  these,  considering  the  ongoing  partial  tightness  in  financial 
conditions, the Central Bank considers that the uncertainties pertaining to the strength and 
endurance of the recent partial revival in demand may not yet have come to an end.

Distinguished Members of the Press, 
The nature of the period we are going through increases the importance of monitoring data 
pertaining  to  the  speed  and  timing  of  global  recovery,  with  respect  to  the  foreign  demand 
outlook. Since the last Report period, growth forecasts for 2009 for the US economy have 
been quite stable while those for the Eurozone have been revised downwards. Meanwhile, 
global growth forecasts for 2010 were revised upwards by a small margin in the last quarter. 
An analysis of regional growth forecasts reveals that the upward revision in the Eurozone for 
end-2010 has been more limited compared to the revision in the US economy. To sum up, 
while  forecasts  for  global  economic  activity  have  become  relatively  more  stable  in the  last 
quarter, the outlook for the “recovery process in the Eurozone – our main trade partner – to 
be anemic and protracted” has strengthened (Table 2).

In sum, assessing domestic and external demand developments together, revised forecasts 
for  medium-term  inflation  are  based  on  a  framework  where  aggregate  demand  conditions 
would support disinflation for a long period of time.  
Distinguished Guests, 
Despite  the  realization  that  recovery  in  the  global  economy  will  be  slow,  increasing 
perceptions regarding the worst part of the crisis being over caused a rebound in commodity 
prices. In line with this development, oil prices hovered above the previous assumption of oil 
prices at USD 55 per barrel in the Inflation Report of April. Our assumption for oil prices have 
been  revised  in  line  with  the  average  of  futures  prices  registered  in  the  first  half  of  July. 
Within  this  framework,  oil  prices  were  assumed  to  be  USD  60  on  average  in  2009  and 
around USD 70 in 2010 and thereafter. On the other hand, projections for food inflation of 7.5 
percent for end-2009 and 6 percent for the following years have been maintained. 
The impact of exchange rate movements on input costs since the last quarter of 2008 was 
offset by declining import prices. Therefore, import prices denominated in domestic currency 
did not display significant changes. While generating medium-term forecasts, it was assumed 
that imported input costs would increase gradually, in line with the anticipated slow recovery 
in global economic activity.  
16 
 BIS Review 103/2009
Furthermore,  revised  forecasts  envisage  that  world  interest  rates  will  remain  low  for  an 
extended  period  of  time.  Regarding  fiscal  policy,  it  is  assumed  that  fiscal  discipline  will  be 
established  within  a  medium-term  program.  Moreover,  it  is  assumed  that  adjustments  in 
taxes/administered prices in the second half of 2009 will add around 1.5 percentage points to 
2009 inflation.  
Distinguished members of the Press and Esteemed Guests, 
Against this background, assuming that there is further easing in policy rates in the near term 
followed by no change until the end of 2010, medium-term forecasts suggest that, with 70 
percent  probability,  inflation  will  be  between  4.9  and  6.9  percent  with  a  mid-point  of  5.9 
percent at the end of 2009, and between 3.7 and 6.9 percent with a mid-point of 5.3 percent 
at the end of 2010. Furthermore, inflation is expected to come down to 4.9 percent by the 
end of 2011 and to 4.8 percent by mid-2012 (Figure 26).

* Indicates a 70-percent confidence interval for the forecast. 
 
Revised  forecasts  indicate  that  even  if  policy  rates  are  kept  at  low  levels  for  an  extended 
period, aggregate demand conditions will continue to underpin the disinflation process over 
the next two years. Forecasts also indicate that significant base effects may lead to some 
inflation volatility in the short term. As cumulative inflation during the first half of 2009 has 
been historically low at 1.83 percent, it is estimated that inflation will rise in the first half of 
2010 due to base effects (Figure 26). As the impact of adjustments in taxes and administered 
prices made for the sake of budget balance will ease, we forecast that inflation will display a 
downward trend starting from the second half of 2010 and stabilize slightly below the end-
2011 target of 5.5 percent. It is critical to note that inflation would be less persistent and thus 
BIS Review 103/2009 
 17
the  economic  recovery  would  be  smoother  if  economic  agents  adopt  these  forecasts  as  a 
benchmark in their pricing decisions.  
I would like to underline that any new data or information regarding the inflation outlook may 
lead  to  a  change  in  the  monetary  policy  stance.  Therefore,  assumptions  on  future  policy 
rates underlying the inflation forecast should not be perceived as a commitment on behalf of 
the CBRT. 
Risks 
Distinguished Members of the Press, 
In  the  last  part  of  my  presentation,  I  would  like  to  mention  the  risks  with  respect  to  the 
inflation outlook in the upcoming period and give some information pertaining to the probable 
monetary policy strategy should these risks materialize. 
As  I  have  mentioned  earlier  in  my  speech,  despite  having  partially  receded,  the  risks 
regarding the global economy are still important for the inflation and monetary policy outlook. 
In  particular,  ongoing  problems  in  credit  and  labor  markets  pose  downside  risks  on  global 
activity.  Should  global  conditions  and  consequently  domestic  economic  activity  further 
deteriorate, the  CBRT  would  consider  another  cycle  of  rate  cuts,  and then  maintain  policy 
rates at low single digits for an extended period of time.  
Another  possible  scenario  is  a  surge  in  capital  inflows  to  emerging  markets  owing  to  the 
relative  improvement  in  creditworthiness  of  these  countries.  In  this  context,  receding  risk 
premia  and  appreciating  currencies  would  present  downside  risks  regarding  inflation 
prospects.  These  circumstances  could  also  trigger  acceleration  in  rate  cuts,  or  another 
easing cycle, which could then bring policy rates which hover around low single digits for a 
prolonged period of time.  
Increasing budget deficits worldwide continue to pose risks on inflation expectations and thus 
on  global  interest  rates  in  the  long  term.  The  medium-term  forecasts  presented  above 
envisage that the slow recovery in global economic activity and rising saving rates will keep 
global interest rates at low levels for an extended period. However, the lack of a clear exit 
strategy from global fiscal stimulus packages creates upside risks regarding global inflation 
rates and therefore longer-term global interest rates.  
Counter-cyclical  fiscal  policies  to  curb  the  contractionary  effect  of  the  crisis  on  economic 
activity,  which  have  also  been  introduced  in  Turkey  in  line  with  global  trends,  have 
accelerated the rise in budget deficit. The relatively low level of public sector indebtedness in 
Turkey  compared  to  other  countries  implies  that  we  have  a  broad  fiscal  space.  However, 
when  the  maturity  composition  of  borrowing,  the  level  of  interest  rates  and  the  depth  of 
financial  markets  are  taken  into  account,  it  is  observed  that  the  fiscal  space  is  not  broad 
enough  for  countercyclical  fiscal  policies.  Therefore,  backing  up  the  short-term  increase  in 
budget deficit with a  medium-term program ensuring the sustainability of debt dynamics is 
crucial for maintaining our risk premium at relatively low levels.  
Accordingly,  domestic  perceptions  regarding  public  finance  are  very  important  for  the 
monetary policy strategy to be implemented in the medium-term, especially after 2011. The 
global crisis has raised awareness as to the resilience of our financial system and helped risk 
indicators to perform better compared to other developing countries and enabled a fast rate-
cut  cycle.  Thus,  single-digits  were  finally  achieved  in  short-term  interest  rates  after  many 
years.  Meanwhile,  the  level  of  medium  and  long-term  market  interest  rates  still  remain 
elevated. The present conjuncture offers an important opportunity to achieve and maintain 
single digits in market interest rates throughout the forecast horizon of three years. Achieving 
and maintaining single digits in medium and long-term market interest rates will depend on 
establishing fiscal discipline. The introduction of a satisfactory perspective for fiscal discipline 
in  the  upcoming  period  would  not  only  decrease  the  risk  premium  but  would  also  help  to

keep policy rates at low levels for an extended period of time. Therefore, should a concrete 
medium-term  fiscal  program,  which  safeguards  the  sustainability  of  debt  dynamics  and 
budget discipline, be established, it is possible that market interest rates will remain at low 
levels permanently. 
Distinguished members of the press, 
To  sum  up,  growing  perceptions  that  recovery  in  the  global  economy  will  be  slow  and 
gradual, saving rates will remain high and global interest rates will remain low for quite some 
time; enabling monetary policy to provide a more concrete perspective for the future. Within 
this framework, forecasts are based on an outlook, which envisages that short-term interest 
rates  will  be  somewhat  further  eased  and  not  raised  until  the  end  of  2010.  The  monetary 
policy  for  2011  and  thereafter  will  be  determined  according  to  the  course  of  variables 
affecting  the  inflation  outlook.  With  the  end  of the  crisis,  should  the  fiscal  discipline  be  re-
established  in  a  gradual  and  forceful  manner,  short-term  interest  rates  are  projected  to 
remain in single-digits throughout the forecast horizon of three years.  
Distinguished guests,  
Even if our primary objective is to achieve price stability, I would like to reiterate that we will 
continue  to  take  all  the  necessary  measures  and  use  all  policy  instruments  available  in  a 
timely  and  due  manner  should  the  likelihood  arise  that  problems  in  international  markets 
adversely  affect  domestic  financial  markets.  Therefore,  strengthening  the  commitment  to 
fiscal  discipline  and  the  structural  reform  agenda  is  also  critical  to  facilitate  expectations 
management and to support the effectiveness of monetary policy decisions. In this respect, 
the  utmost  importance  is  attached  to  the  commitment  to  the  European  Union  accession 
process, and timely implementation of the structural reforms. I would like to underline that we 
will  be  closely  monitoring  developments  pertaining  to  public  finance  while  determining  our 
medium-term monetary policy strategies. Thank you very much for your attention.
