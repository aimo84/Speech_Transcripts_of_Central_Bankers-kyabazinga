Philipp Hildebrand: The global financial crisis – analysis and outlook 
Summary of a speech by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of 
the Swiss National Bank, at the NZZ-Podium, Zurich, 5 February 2009. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 We are currently experiencing the most severe and most complex financial crisis in several 
decades.  It  has  affected  many  people  around  the  globe,  and  finger-pointing  and  casting 
blame happen all too easily. Yet only a careful investigation of the responsibilities is likely to 
point to ways in which our financial system, and ultimately our economy, can be made more 
resilient once this crisis has been overcome. Financial markets react to incentives, and these 
incentives were misplaced in the past. It is in our power to start lobbying for clearly defined 
and  risk-limiting  conditions.  If  the  responsible  authorities  wish  to  enact  more  stringent 
regulation,  we  ought  to  give  them  our  unconditional  support.  The  National  Bank  is 
determined to employ all the means at its disposal to ward off an economic contraction.
