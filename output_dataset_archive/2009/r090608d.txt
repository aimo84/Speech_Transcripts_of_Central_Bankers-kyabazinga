Ric Battelino: Global monetary developments 
Address by Mr Ric Battelino, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to 2009 
Securities & Derivatives Industry Association Conference, Sydney, 28 May 2009. 
I would like to thank Chris Becker for his extensive assistance with this talk. 
 Introduction  
Over the past eight months, many central banks have reduced interest rates to unusually low 
levels. Some have also undertaken unconventional measures to implement monetary policy, 
such as: 
• 
• 
• 
giving commitments about the future path of interest rates;  
greatly expanding their balance sheets; and  
shifting  the  composition  of  their  assets  from  securities  that  are  short-term  and 
relatively risk-free to those that are longer-term and somewhat riskier.  
Given  the  unprecedented  nature  of  these  measures,  many  people  are  asking  what  they 
mean for the world economy, and particularly for inflation. 
Debate about these issues will no doubt continue for a long time yet, and I certainly don’t 
pretend to have the answers. In my talk today I will set out what various central banks have 
been doing, and offer a perspective on how these actions could be interpreted. 
Monetary policy implementation 
Until recently, the majority of the world’s central banks followed a fairly standard model when 
it came to implementing monetary policy:  
• 
first, a monetary policy committee or board set a target for a short-term interest rate, 
taking into account the central bank’s objectives;  
second,  central  banks  then  undertook  operations  in  financial  markets  to  adjust  the 
supply of funds in the market to a level consistent with the targeted short-term interest 
rate; and  
third, changes in short-term interest rates fed through to a wide range of other interest 
rates in the economy.  
  An important channel through which this approach to monetary policy works is by influencing 
the demand for credit. The supply of credit is assumed to adjust to demand, which in a world 
of  deregulated  financial  systems  and  stable,  well  functioning  markets,  is  a  reasonable 
assumption. 
When markets are disrupted, however, the normal transmission mechanism can break down 
at several points:  
• 
first,  the  relationship  between  the  amount  of  funds  supplied  through  market 
operations  and  the  overnight  interest  rate  can  become  unstable.  For  example,  if 
banks start to hoard liquidity, more funds need to be supplied to keep the overnight 
rate at the target;  
second, even if the target rate is achieved, the flow-through to other interest rates in 
the  economy  may  become  impaired.  If,  for  example,  risk  aversion  in  markets 
increases,  interest  rates  for  term  funds  rise  relative  to  the  overnight  rate,  and 
premiums for credit risk also rise. Reductions in the overnight rate targeted by central

banks, therefore, may not flow through to the same extent as usual to interest rates 
charged on loans; and  
third,  if  banks  become  capital  constrained,  their  willingness  and  capacity  to  lend  at 
any interest rate will be diminished.  
 As  you  know,  over  the  past  year,  many  countries  have  found  that  the  normal  monetary 
transmission mechanism has become less effective. 
Interest rates 
As I noted, many central banks have responded to this by reducing official interest rates to 
abnormally low levels, in some cases close to zero. 
Most of this has happened since September last year. Up until then, monetary policy settings 
around the globe had been following a relatively normal path, guided mainly by inflationary 
pressures. Global monetary policy entered a tightening phase around 2004 and the majority 
of central banks continued to tighten policy into 2008. Of the 35 largest countries or monetary 
areas, 23 had higher interest rates at September 2008 than at the start of the year, seven 
had unchanged rates and five had lower rates (see Table 1). This is not surprising because 
global inflationary pressures were still rising in the middle of 2008. Commodity markets did 
not  peak  until  July  2008,  and  indicators  of  pressure  on  global  capacity  –  such  as  prices 
charged on shipping contracts – were at extreme levels.

*  After  raising  its  policy  rate  by  200 basis  points  in  November  2008,  Pakistan's  central  bank 
lowered its policy rate by 100 basis points in April 2009. 
**  Russia's  central  bank  increased  its  policy  rate  by  a  cumulative  200 basis  points  during 
November  2008  in  moves  aimed  at  stemming  capital  outflows  and  mitigating  the  downward 
pressure on the ruble. 
*** After initially lowering rates by 350 basis points in mid October 2008, the Icelandic central 
bank increased its policy rate by 600 basis points two weeks later as part of the conditions of 
the IMF's rescue package. Subsequent easings have amounted to 500 basis points. 
 
The unusual period of monetary policy began in September 2008, after the failure of Lehman 
Brothers dramatically escalated the financial crisis. This in turn led to a collapse of household 
and business confidence around the world. Official interest rates have since been cut very 
sharply  across  virtually  all  countries  due  to  the  highly  synchronised  nature  of  the  current 
economic  cycle.  The  average  reduction  in  interest  rates  has  been  330  basis  points  in  the 
developed  economies  and  about  300  basis  points  in  emerging  economies.  Among  the 
developed economies, only four – Australia, New Zealand, Denmark and Norway – still have 
official interest rates above 1 per cent. Official interest rates have never been this low in the 
developed world in the 150-year period for which we have data (Graph 1). 
Graph 1  
 
The  reason  why  official  interest  rates  have  been  reduced  to  such  extreme  levels  is  that 
frictions  in  markets  had  made  interest  rates  on  loans  to  households  and  businesses  less 
responsive to cuts in official rates. In the case of the US, for example, even though the Fed 
had reduced official rates by 325 basis points by September 2008, the standard mortgage

rate  had  hardly  changed  (Graph  2).  Bigger  cuts  in  official  rates  were  therefore  needed  in 
order to bring about a given fall in interest rates on loans.

In assessing the level of global interest rates, it is important to look not just at official rates, 
but at a broader spectrum of rates faced by borrowers. We don’t have data on housing rates 
going back 150 years, but it is clear that they are not at the very low levels of official rates. In 
most  countries,  including  Australia,  they  are  around  1½-2  percentage  points  below  their 
decade averages – that is, low, but not at extremes (Table 2). 
 
For  corporate  borrowers,  interest  rates  are  not  unusually  low.  In  fact,  in  most  developed 
economies, interest rates faced by corporations in capital markets are, if anything, still a little 
above decade averages, due to the large increase in risk premiums (Table 3).

 Other monetary measures  
Let  me  now  turn  to  the  other  unconventional  measures  central  banks  have  undertaken. 
These are often grouped in the popular press under the generic title of “quantitative easing” 
or “printing money”, but they really fall into three distinct categories:  
• 
• 
• 
measures to add to banks’ reserve balances;  
measures to reduce the term structure of interest rates; and  
measures to support specific credit markets and/or take credit risk onto central bank 
balance  sheets.  The  US  Fed  has  coined  the  term  “credit  easing”1  to  cover  such 
policies.  
All  these  measures  involve  changes  in  either  the  composition  or  the  size  of  central  bank 
balance sheets. While all are aimed at sustaining the flow of credit in the economy, some do 
so  by  working  on  credit  demand,  while  others  aim  to  stimulate  the  supply  of  credit.  The 
measures are not mutually exclusive, but can be mixed in different combinations to best suit

Economics, London, 13 January.

the  circumstances  of  the  country.  Indeed,  it can  make  sense,  in  terms  of  maximising  their 
impact, for policies to combine elements of each of the above measures. 
Measures to increase bank reserves 
Measures  designed  to  increase  the  supply  of  bank  reserves  can,  I  think,  be  accurately 
referred to as “quantitative easing”. They involve the central bank increasing the size of its 
balance  sheet  by  increasing  its  purchases  of  securities  from  the  market  and  crediting  the 
payments to banks’ reserve balances at the central bank. 
These  measures  differ  from  routine  market  operations  both  in  their  scale  and  their  intent. 
They  involve  operations  on  a  much  larger  scale  than  normal.  Some  central  banks  have 
expanded the supply of reserves by several percentage points of GDP (Graph 3). 
Graph 3 
  
Perhaps  more  importantly,  the  objectives  underpinning  quantitative  easing  are  different. 
Whereas routine operations are working through interest rates to influence the demand for 
credit, quantitative easing seeks to influence the supply of credit. The aim is to provide more 
reserves  than  banks  wish  to  hold,  with  the  intention  that  they  will  try  to  dispose  of  these 
excess reserves by increasing their lending. 
This  type  of  activity  is  usually  undertaken  only  when  interest  rates  have  fallen  to  zero  or 
near-zero levels. While, theoretically, a central bank could undertake quantitative easing at 
any level of interest rates, in practice it is difficult to do so, as large-scale provision of excess 
reserves forces the interest rate to zero. The central bank could stop this from happening by 
paying  a  market-based  interest  rate  on  reserve  holdings,  but  this  would  undermine  the 
purpose of the exercise by reducing the incentive for banks to lend their reserves. 
Measures to flatten the yield curve 
As I noted earlier, monetary policy settings in most countries are normally defined in terms of 
a target for a short-term interest rate. The precise relationship between official interest rates 
and the interest rates faced by borrowers varies from country to country. In some countries, 
such  as  Australia,  where  the  bulk  of  banks’  loans  to  customers  are  at  floating  rates,  the 
relationship is usually relatively close. In countries where banks mainly lend to customers at 
longer-term  fixed  rates,  the  relationship  between  official  rates  and  loan  rates  is  more 
BIS Review 67/2009 
 7
complex, and therefore more prone to being unsettled when market conditions deteriorate. 
As such, loan rates in these countries can become quite insensitive to changes in the short-
term rate, reducing the effectiveness of monetary policy. 
Because of the limited flow-through from short rates to long rates, a number of central banks 
have recently taken direct measures to reduce longer-term rates. 
One way they have done this is by giving commitments to keep short-term rates low for a 
long time. Central banks in the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand and Sweden have done this. 
By signalling such a commitment, forward interest rate expectations are lowered, resulting in 
lower  longer-term  yields.  The  success  of  this measure  in  lowering  term  rates  will  naturally 
depend on how credible the commitments are. 
A  second  set  of  measures  involves  the  central  bank  buying  a  large  amount  of  long-term 
assets. Such measures work mainly through a portfolio balance effect, increasing demand 
for these securities above what it would otherwise have been, thereby lowering their yields. 
There are, of course, also flow-on effects to other asset prices. 
Purchases of long-term securities can be undertaken in association with, or independently of, 
quantitative easing. In the former case, the central bank would buy long-term bonds and pay 
for them by adding to banks’ reserves. In the latter, it would buy long-term bonds but pay for 
them by selling some of its existing holdings of short-term securities, or by issuing its own 
securities, thereby leaving reserve balances  unchanged. Purchases of long-term securities 
can also contain an element of credit easing, if the securities being purchased carry credit 
risk. 
Credit easing 
At  their  most  basic,  credit  easing  measures  might  involve  simply  expanding  the  range  of 
collateral  that  central  banks  will  accept  in  their  repo  operations.  Most  central  banks  in  the 
world  have  done  this  over  the  past  couple  of  years  and  so  can  be  thought  of  as  having 
engaged in some limited form of credit easing. But the term is normally understood to apply 
to more forceful measures, such as: 
• 
providing  long-term  central  bank  funding  to  vehicles  set  up  to  acquire  private 
securities or loans;  
outright purchases by central banks of securities carrying credit risk; and  
guaranteeing some part of the assets held by commercial banks.  
• 
• 
These measures involve decisions about the allocation of credit between specific institutions 
and  sectors  of  the  economy.  This  is  usually  a  funtion  of  fiscal  policy,  whereas  monetary 
policy  is  normally  general  in  its  application.  The  measures  therefore  start  to  blur  the 
distinction between monetary and fiscal policy.  
The effectiveness of various measures 
As  with  normal  monetary  policy,  the  impact  of  these  various  unconventional  measures  is 
likely to take quite some time to become apparent. This is particularly the case for measures 
involving bank reserves. 
Given  the  relatively  limited  time  that  most  of  these  measures  have  been  in  place,  it  is 
therefore  premature  at  this  stage  to  draw  any  firm  conclusions  about  their  effectiveness. 
Also,  as  most  of  these  measures  were  undertaken  relatively  simultaneously,  only  their 
combined effects can be judged. So far, their main impact seems to have been on market 
pricing, which is starting to return to more normal levels. 
One guide to the effectiveness of these measures may come from past episodes, such as 
that in Japan in the early part of this decade. Of course, circumstances differ greatly from 
8 
 BIS Review 67/2009
country to country so there are limits on the extent to which one country’s past experiences 
are relevant to others. 
The Japanese episode was very prolonged. The economy started to stagnate following the 
collapse  of  property  prices  and  the  stock  market  in  the  late  1980s.  The  interaction  of 
macroeconomic weakness and instability in the banking system exacerbated the downturn. 
Through the 1990s the Bank of Japan responded to this by lowering interest rates but, by 
1999, the policy rate had been reduced to zero. 
In 2001, the Bank of Japan switched from targeting an interest rate to an explicit target for 
banks’  reserve  balances.  The  target  was  initially  set  at  ¥5  trillion  and  then  subsequently 
raised  several  times  to  peak  at  ¥35  trillion  (Graph  4).  Relative  to  GDP,  this  increase  in 
reserves was not dissimilar to increases recently experienced by other major central banks. 
Graph 4 
  
During the quantitative easing period, base money expanded rapidly due to the increase in 
banks’  deposits  with  the  Bank  of  Japan  (Graph  5).  While  one  can  never  know  what  the 
counterfactual  would  have  been  in  the  absence  of  this  policy,  the  evidence  available 
indicates that the expansion in the money base did little to boost broader money aggregates 
or bank lending. Instead, banks appear to have hoarded the additional liquidity. Bank lending 
had been contracting since the late 1990s and continued to do so through to 2006. Research 
conducted by the Bank of Japan concluded that the ability of quantitative easing to impact on 
aggregate demand and prices was limited.2

Working Paper Series, No. 06-E-10, July.

The  Bank  of  Japan’s  experience  also  provides  some  evidence  in  relation  to  yield  curve 
measures. Its quantitative easing was implemented by buying long-term government bonds 
and it also gave a commitment to maintain official interest rates at zero for a long time. In 
effect,  therefore,  the  quantitative  easing  undertaken  by  the  Bank  of  Japan  was  combined 
with measures to flatten the yield curve. The evidence suggests that these measures were 
effective in lowering the yield curve in Japan, particularly the medium-term point of the curve. 
Conclusions 
Let me conclude. 
With central banks doing unconventional things, it is not surprising that there is considerable 
debate  about  the  effectiveness  and  consequences  of  the  various  measures.  On  the  one 
hand,  some  argue  that  the  measures  will  be  ineffective.  On  the  other  side  of  the  debate, 
others argue that they will eventually result in higher inflation.  
Those  of  the  former  view  point  to  the  experience  of  Japan  over  the  past  decade  as 
supporting their case. The conclusion they draw from that experience is that, if the household 
and corporate sectors are seeking to consolidate their balance sheets, and banks remain risk 
averse and capital constrained, simply adding to banks’ reserves at the central bank may not 
result in any generalised expansion of money and credit.  
The  other  side  of  the  debate  –  that  the  measures  will  result  in  higher  inflation  –  implicitly 
assumes that the measures will be effective in stimulating the economy, since money does 
not  miraculously  transform  into  inflation  without  affecting  economic  and  financial  activity. 
Rather, their argument is that central banks will be too slow to reverse the various measures. 
As there are no technical factors that would prevent or slow the reversal of recent measures 
–  they  can  be  reversed  simultaneously  or  in  any  sequence  –  the  argument  must  rest  on 
central banks making incorrect policy judgments. This is always a possibility. But, the high 
state  of  awareness  that  currently  exists  about  the  risk  of  being  too  slow  to  reverse  recent 
exceptional measures should limit the probability of such a mistake being made.
