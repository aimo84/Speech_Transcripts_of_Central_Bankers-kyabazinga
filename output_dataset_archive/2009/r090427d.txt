INVITED GUESTS 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
I  am  grateful  to  the  Vice  Chancellor  of  Mulungushi  University,  Professor  Chinene,  for 
extending  an  invitation  to  me  to  witness  the  Launch  of  the  Student  Loan  Scheme  by  our 
Minister of Education Hon. Professor Lungwangwa. 
Chairperson, I am reliably informed that the Student Loan Scheme being launched today is 
the  latest  among  the  many  product  initiatives  that  Indo  Zambia  Bank  Limited  will  be 
launching in the near future . 
The Student Loan Scheme represents a major shift from the traditional loan schemes that 
have for a long time characterised traditional banking models in Zambia. 
Chairperson, the Bank of Zambia supports the introduction of innovative products such as 
the  Student  Loan  Scheme,  a  service  that  will  allow  parents  and  guardians  who  bank  with 
Indo  Zambia  Bank  Limited  to  access  loans  to  meet  University  fees  for  their  children  at 
concessionary rates. 
Hon.  Minister,  this  Loan  Scheme  being  launched  today  provides  a  real  opportunity  for 
human capital development, which is necessary for national development. It enables children 
who would otherwise be excluded from the educational system have decent opportunities to 
receive  education,  as  their  parents  can  now  access  loans  specifically  targeted  at  meeting 
their educational expenses. 
Ladies and Gentlemen, a nation’s development depends on the levels of skills among its 
people and it is our expectation that the launch of this Scheme will contribute towards this 
noble cause. 
To  this  end,  I  would  like  to  encourage  parents  and  guardians  to  use  the  Student  Loan 
Scheme in order to realise the vision of educating their children. 
Chairperson, what we are witnessing today represents an initiative by banks to respond to 
the needs of the community. As the Central Bank, we commend your bank for this initiative, 
which  was  borne  out  of  the  identified  need  to  develop  financial  products  that  address 
problems in our society. 
Chairperson,  Ladies  and  Gentlemen,  let  me  end  by  reminding  players  in  the  banking 
sector that as new products and services emerge, different or heightened levels of risk also 
emerge. The challenges that financial innovation poses for public policy and the regulatory 
framework in ensuring financial stability are enormous and cannot be over looked. 
In this regard, let me call upon the management of Indo-Zambia Bank to not only look at the 
benefits, but more also on the risks that accompany financial innovation. From the Bank of 
BIS Review 50/2009

Zambia’s  point  of  view,  the  objective  of  financial  stability  remains  key  in  all  our  activities. 
Financial  stability  depends  to  a  large  extent  on  the  existence  of  robust  risk  management 
systems  of  financial  institutions.  It  is  therefore,  important  that  risk  management  systems 
should keep pace with financial innovation. I have no doubt that the banking sector will rise to 
this challenge. 
Once again, thank you for the opportunity to witness this important event.
