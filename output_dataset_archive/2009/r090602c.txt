José De Gregorio: Monetary Policy Report 
Speech by Mr José De Gregorio, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, at the presentation 
of the Monetary Policy Report before the Finance Commission of the Honorable Senate of 
the Republic of Chile, Santiago, 13 May 2009. 
 Introduction 
Ms President of the Finance Commission, Senator Evelyn Matthei, senators integrating this 
Commission and senators present, 
On behalf of the Board of the Central Bank of Chile I am grateful for your invitation to share 
our vision of recent macroeconomic developments, prospects and implications for monetary 
policy that are the substance of the Monetary Policy Report (the Report) of May 2009. 
When we began presenting our Report to this Commission in January this year, we said we 
were in the midst of the worst economic and financial world crisis in several decades. Today, 
four months on, we can say the situation has worsened.  
The world at large is in a severe recession. This year the level of global output will fall for the 
first time in over sixty years, and world trade will see an unprecedented decline. Since the 
Great  Depression  we  hadn’t  seen  a  world  crisis  of  the  magnitude  we  are  going  through 
today. Big challenges remain open, but in the past few weeks there has been “a glimmer of 
hope” that suggests that the developed economies may be stabilizing. The lessons learned 
from the Great Depression and the commitment on the part of policymakers around the world 
to ensure that the misery that it caused will not replicate itself this time have prevented the 
current situation from causing even more severe disruptions. 
One particular aspect of the current crisis has been the synchrony among different countries. 
The  financial  earthquake  that  devastated  developed  markets  last  September  and  October 
and  its  aftershocks  that  swept  over  the  financial  systems  of  every  economy,  over  output 
prospects  in  the  world,  over  income  and  wealth,  just  to  name  a  few,  propagated  to 
expectations which deteriorated across the entire world.  
The  Chilean  economy  has  not  been  absent  to  this  phenomenon.  As  we  said  in  the  very 
beginning, our economy is not and cannot be immune. You can see it in the latest figures 
and  projections  contained  in  this  Monetary  Policy  Report.  The  channels  and  mechanisms 
through  which  the  crisis  is  transmitted  to  our  economy  are  varied,  and  the  severe 
international  shock  that  hit  us  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  last  year  has  had  damaging 
repercussions locally, even more so than we foresaw in January.  
A question that arises naturally is, why the big impact on our economy? Unfortunately, no 
single  answer  exists  and  only  time  and  the  gathering  of  information  will  allow  us  more 
certainty. For now, from observing the data we see that one of the strongest factors in the 
downturn of both domestic demand and world trade, has been the global crisis of confidence, 
understood  as  worsened  expectations  and  increased  uncertainty  around  the  world,  not 
overlooking the impact of financial tightening that hit hardest in September and October of 
last year.  
The sudden and widespread nature of the downfall of demand across countries that are so 
heterogeneous is proof of how difficult it is to differentiate and to avoid the instant impact of 
such an acute crisis. The downfall made no distinction based on the economies’ strengths or 
weaknesses. GDP fell in nearly 90 per cent of the countries in the fourth quarter of last year 
(Figure 1). However, macroeconomic policies can build a solid base from where to weather 
the  shock  coming  from  abroad  and  create  countercyclical  impulses  to  mitigate  them,  thus 
making room for a rapid, sustained recuperation. 
BIS Review 65/2009

A few years back, it was hard to think that a world recession this big would not translate into 
major  problems  in  our  country  and  in  developing  economies  in  general,  but  it  has  not 
happened. The effects of the crisis in Chile have been mitigated thanks to policy efforts and 
to our own strengths as a country.  
This crisis will bring about long discussions and analyses of its effects, and lessons will be 
drawn.  We  can  now  benefit  from  the  lessons  we  learned  the  hard  way  from  the  profound 
financial  and  real  crisis  we  suffered  in  1982-1983.  Chile  has  steadily  built  throughout  the 
years solid macroeconomic and financial institutions that, although they do not shield us from 
world events, do permit us to adjust to external shocks at substantially lower costs than we 
would have faced in the past. Therefore, as we have also said since the current crisis turned 
into chaos, Chile has never been better prepared to weather a shock like the one we are now 
enduring.  Proof  of  this  is  the  enormous  countercyclical  effort  of  macroeconomic  policies 
carried out in the context of a solid, stable financial system.  
In fact, with respect to October of last year, and compared with the rest of the world, ours has 
been  one  of  the  greatest  easing  efforts  of  monetary  policy,  and  our  monetary  policy  rate 
(MPR)  is  at  its  historic  low  (Figure  2).  Such  an  expansionary  monetary  policy  has  been 
implemented  within  the  context  of  a  credible  inflation  targeting  regime,  which  ensures  its 
effectiveness facing shocks of the magnitude we are seeing now.  
Chile’s inflation was among the highest between early 2007 and October 2008, a period that 
saw commodity prices soar. Also, Chile’s inflation has been one of the fastest to drop (Figure 
3).  This  reveals  something  we  pointed  out  emphatically  during  2008: that  the  origin  of  our 
high inflation was mainly foreign, but that it was the duty of monetary policy to control it from 
propagating  excessively  into  other  prices  and  expectations  (Figure  4).  Thanks  to  that 
determination  we  have  been  able  to  aggressively  cut  the  MPR,  without  compromising  our 
commitment to price stability. 
A less credible policy would be incapable of being as expansionary as it is today, because it 
would not pass through to the interest rate structure or to market rates. In the past, monetary 
expansion was limited  by fears of  financial and macroeconomic instability. With the strong 
fundamentals of today’s Chilean economy, such limitations don’t exist.  
Although nobody escaped the impact of the financial collapse of the end of last year on the 
real economy, the ability of each economy to bounce back will be largely determined by its 
own strengths. That is demonstrated both by recent projections by international organizations 
and private agencies and by the evidence discussed in this Report. Chile should be one of 
the first economies to reap the benefits of expansionary policies and take steps forward in a 
faster, sustained recovery. Therefore, as soon as in the second half of this year our economy 
should be back to trend growth rates. 
Transmission channels of the international crisis to the domestic economy 
Let me now review the various channels whereby we have been affected by the international 
crisis,  which  provides  the  necessary  context  to  explain  our  policy  decisions  and  the 
projections on our economy contained in this Report.  
The  complex  moment  for  the  world  economy  has  prompted,  on  one  hand,  a  sharp  fall  in 
world demand for our exports; growth projections for Chile’s trading partners for the two-year 
period  2009-2010  went  from  an  average  of  1.6  percent  in  January  to  0.3  percent  in  the 
baseline scenario in this Report, affecting the prices of the products we sell to the world.  
The terms of trade, as we had already anticipated in January, have seen a steep fall, hurting 
national  disposable  income.  Nevertheless,  the  drop  in  commodity  prices  has  had  an 
immediate positive effect on household income, particularly through oil and other imported 
goods.

 BIS Review 65/2009
Although  some  specific  sectors  are  having  difficulties  placing  their  products  abroad,  the 
volume of Chilean exports, largely linked to natural resources, has not declined significantly. 
This reveals that price adjustments have permitted them to continue to be present in markets 
around  the  world.  This  is  quite  different  from  the  realities  of  some  manufactured  goods 
exporters that have experienced sharp, severe and widespread downfalls. The figures show 
that the impact in terms of economic deceleration during the fourth quarter of last year was 
much  more  severe  in  those  economies  whose  export  basket  is  tilted  towards  durables 
(Figure 5).  
Another transmission channel of the global crisis has been the effect on domestic financial 
markets  of  the  deteriorated  financial  conditions  in  developed  economies  together  with  the 
increase in the global risk perception. Despite reduced stress in the past several months, the 
world  financial  environment  continues  to  cause  concern.  Still,  conditions  facing  Chilean 
banks  and  firms  to  access  external  credit  sources  are  more  favorable  than  for  other 
emerging economies, no sudden stop has occurred in external inflows, while the local bond 
market has taken a significant impulse.  
Chile’s  foreign  financing  needs  have  been  met  easily,  and  the  reduction  in  the  current 
account  deficit  has  lessened  future  requirements.  Absence  of  tensions  in  this  setting  is 
reflected in the Chilean sovereign risk trend, in our country’s credit rating upgrade applied a 
few months back, and in the foreign currency interest rates in the domestic market.  
In  addition,  the  change  in  risk  perception  and  global  financial  conditions  triggered  a 
tightening of domestic lending standards, which has been offset by measures of monetary 
policy and liquidity provision. The interest rate cut applied by the banks has been evident, 
reflecting in consumer and commercial loan rates now hundreds of basis points below their 
peak in late 2008. Mortgage rates, meanwhile, have also declined, although somewhat less 
(Figure 6). 
Accordingly,  market  rates  are  higher  than  they  would  be  in  normal  conditions  given  the 
monetary impulse, because they are also affected by the risk assessment of operations and, 
in the current juncture, a higher premium is being tagged on sectors that are more exposed 
to  the  economic  downturn.  In  addition,  lending  has  slowed  and,  although  somewhat  less 
restrictive marginally, March’s Survey on Economic Conditions, plus additional information, 
reveal that high requisites are in force for bank lending, and consumer demand has fallen.  
The macroeconomic scenario 
A  corollary  to  the  change  of  global  macroeconomic  scenario  has  been  the  significant 
deterioration of expectations combined with increased uncertainty about the future unfolding 
of  the  world  economy.  Income  prospects  for  firms  and  households  have  become  more 
uncertain, while problems in international financial markets could have been resolved faster 
to clear the picture on the true solvency of various financial institutions at the global level.  
The  aforesaid  factors  have  naturally  increased  the  risks  associated  to  economic  activities 
and to decision-making processes, contributing to the sharp reduction in expenditure by the 
end of 2008 and to the revision of consumption, investment and production decisions around 
the globe. This factor may be the culprit of a large share of the fall in the level of domestic 
demand  in  Chile,  much  larger  than  the  fall  in  GDP,  which  cannot  be  fully  explained  by 
movements  in  the  usual  macroeconomic  variables.  This  is  particularly  visible  in  the 
components  that  are  most  sensitive  to  the  cycle  and  to  expectations,  such  as  durable 
consumption, inventories, and gross fixed capital formation in machinery and equipment. The 
evolution  of  indicators  of  consumers  and  entrepreneurs’  expectations  –  IPEC  and  IMCE  – 
despite a recent small rebound, shows levels below those seen in the few months leading to 
the crisis (Figure 7). 
The fall in domestic demand also responds, albeit to a lesser extent, to a cyclical adjustment 
component. Up to the third quarter of 2008, domestic demand grew at annual rates above 10 
BIS Review 65/2009 
 3
percent  during  several  quarters  (Figure  8),  driven  primarily  by  investment  and  durable 
consumption.  Output,  meanwhile,  was  showing  clearly  lower  growth  rates,  because  a 
significant  portion  of  the  demand  was  deviating  to  imported  goods.  The  worsening  of  the 
financial crisis in the developed markets only sped up and deepened this cyclical adjustment. 
The drop in domestic demand has been most visible in a fall in imports, limiting the extension 
of the current account deficit forecast for this year.  
Accordingly, the impulse of the world economy and the response of domestic demand to the 
worsened expectations and to the prevailing uncertainty will be negative this year, although 
partly  offset  by  expansionary  monetary  and  fiscal  policies.  Because  of  the  connection 
between our economy’s prospects and the external environment, whatever judgment is made 
regarding the future pace of global recovery is crucial in the evaluation of our economy and 
its relevant external environment.  
There  are  signs  in  developed  market  and  commodity  prices  –  particularly  copper  –  that 
suggest that the world economic downturn may be coming to an end. Still, growth projects for 
the main industrialized areas for the remaining of 2009 and throughout 2010 are bleak. This 
is  partly  mitigated  by  growth  forecasts  in  emerging  economies,  which  are  stronger  than  in 
developed  countries,  thanks  to  the  normalization  of  financial  flows,  the  higher  levels  of 
investors’  appetite  for  risk  and  increased  demand  for  commodities.  Emerging  Asia  should 
have  a  quick  rebound,  which  is  already  showing  up  in  some  figures  of  foreign  trade, 
manufacturing output and confidence indicators in said area. All this will push global activity 
to an expansion of 2.1 percent in 2010, after dropping 1.2 percent in 2009 (Table 1). 
As the aforesaid world growth scenario settles, the degrees of uncertainty should gradually 
dissipate,  which  combined  with  monetary  and  fiscal  expansions,  should  allow  for  a  steady 
increase in Chile’s domestic demand and output. Thus, although in the first quarter of this 
year the level of economic activity dropped more mildly than in the end of 2008, its recovery 
should begin to be more evident during the current quarter. The lagged effect of diminished 
activity, consumption and investment of late 2008 anticipate that the economy will experience 
negative annual variation rates at least during this whole quarter, even though compared with 
the previous quarter is already picking up.  
Over  the  course  of  the  second  half  of  2009  and  throughout  the  entire  2010,  annual  GDP 
growth will resume positive values, closer to trend, in line with the strong monetary and fiscal 
impulse  and  with  the  Chilean  economy’s  sound  fundamentals.  Thus,  for  2009  at  large, 
annual GDP growth will be within the range between -0.75 and +0.25 percent, while domestic 
demand will drop 4.7 percent year-on-year. Consistently, the baseline scenario assumes that 
the current account deficit will amount to 1.8 percent of GDP in the year, lower than predicted 
in January (Table 2).  
The  labor  market  is  already  feeling  the  deterioration  of  the  macroeconomic  environment. 
Employment,  after  the  usual  seasonal  adjustment,  has  shown  a  decline  in  the  past  few 
months  and  the  rate  of  unemployment  has  begun  to  rise.  Taking  into  account  the  typical 
relationship  between  the  output  gap  and  employment,  it  is  likely  that  the  labor  market  will 
continue to deteriorate in the months to come, with higher unemployment, despite early signs 
of  recovery  in  the  economy.  Still,  the  implementation  of  the  National  Agreement  for 
Employment  recently  announced  by  the  Government  could  mitigate  part  of  the  rise  in 
unemployment. 
The increase in output gaps has affected inflationary pressures and perspectives in the large 
majority of countries. A big number of economies, Chile included, have seen a rapid decline 
in  inflation  since  the  final  months  of  last  year.  This  obeys  to  a  large  extent  to  commodity 
prices falling, particularly oil and its derivatives. Thus, annual CPI variation went from its 9.9 
percent peak of October 2008 to 4.5 percent in April. Most measures of inflation expectations 
show a decline in recent months, particularly for the short term (Figure 9).  
The baseline scenario of this Report assumes that year-on-year inflation will continue on a 
downward path in the coming months with large swings between the end of this year and the 
4 
 BIS Review 65/2009
beginning of 2010. This, because of the changes in the basis of comparison that include high 
figures  from  May  through  October  2008  and  negative  ones  that  accumulated  from  last 
November to February (Figure 10). Therefore, in the baseline scenario, annual CPI inflation 
will be negative from the end of the third quarter to the beginning of the fourth, to close the 
year 2009 at 0.6 percent. Then it should pick up gradually, to reach 3 percent at the end of 
the policy horizon, this time the second quarter of 2011. The rate of annual variation of core 
indicators has also dropped, a trend that will prevail until the first half of 2010, when they will 
start growing steadily to also hit 3 percent by the end of the policy horizon (Table 3).  
The path projected for inflation rests on a number of assumptions. On one hand, import costs 
will  not  be  a  source  of  additional  inflationary  pressures.  Commodity  prices  will  post  small 
increases  in  the  next  two  years,  in  line  with  the  slow  recovery  foreseen  for  the  world 
economy.  In  particular,  based  on  the  prices  implicit  in  futures  contracts  over  the  ten  days 
prior to the statistical closure of this Report, the average price for oil will be 52 and 64 U.S. 
dollars per barrel this year and next, respectively (Table 4). The peso has appreciated since 
the statistical closure of the January Report. As a methodological assumption, the long-term 
real exchange rate (RER) is assumed to be close to the levels it showed in the two weeks 
prior to the statistical closure of this Report (Figure 11).  
On the other hand, unit labor costs’ annual variation has risen in the past few quarters, due 
to sharp changes in productivity measures based on the path of output and employment. The 
increase in nominal wages, after peaking around 8 percent annually, began to decline. These 
dynamics suggest that the labor market is behaving in line with usual indexation clauses and 
the stage of the cycle. The baseline scenario assumes that these wages will be revised to 
accommodate  the  decline  in  inflation,  the  wider  output  gaps  and  movements  in  the 
employment rate. 
One crucial aspect in the evolution of Chile’s business cycle and prospects of higher growth 
in the rest of this year and during 2010 is stimulus of monetary conditions. The reductions in 
the  monetary  policy  interest  rate  have  transmitted  to  lending  rates  quite  rapidly,  reflecting 
more  favorable  financial  conditions  for  both  firms  and  households.  In  addition,  the  interest 
rate structure of CBC instruments shows, by and large, the possibility of a gradual closing of 
gaps and inflation approaching the target.  
In the highly uncertain times at the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009, the CBC’s and fiscal 
fixed-income bonds played the role of a haven for investors and individuals, pushing down 
the related interest rates. This marks a difference with other economies with weak financial 
situations, and even with ourselves in the past, when increases in global uncertainty used to 
coincide with an increase in these rates. We must thank the soundness of our economy and 
the  solvency  of  our  fiscal  accounts.  This  process  probably  intensified  with  the  aggressive 
cuts to the MPR early this year, and has tended to reverse with the reduction in uncertainty in 
international  financial  markets.  Furthermore,  the  proper  functioning  of  our  capital  markets 
has provided good alternatives for corporate financing (Figure 12). 
A working assumption that is central to this  Report’s macroeconomic scenario is the MPR 
path defined to be consistent with attaining a 3 percent annual inflation over the usual policy 
horizon around two years. This time the baseline scenario assumes that, in the short term, 
the MPR will follow the path similar to the one implicit in the financial asset prices in effect on 
8 May 2009, after the latest cut agreed on in last week’s monetary policy meeting. However, 
towards the end of the projection horizon, the MPR path runs below the aforesaid assumed 
trend (Figure 13). 
As usual, the baseline scenario described above reflects the events that are believed to be 
most  likely  to  occur  with  the  information  available  at  the  closing  of  this  Report.  Logically, 
different events will lead to different macroeconomic conditions and, therefore, an MPR path 
that  will  also  differ.  Currently,  the  level  of  uncertainty  is  definitely  higher  than  normal  and, 
after assessing the probability of alternative scenarios, the Board considers that the balance 
BIS Review 65/2009

of  risks  for  growth  is  biased  downward,  and  is  unbiased  for  inflation.  The  main  risks  are 
associated, once again, to the complex global economic outlook.  
In the past few weeks, some signs of stabilization of the crisis in developed economies have 
begun to show up, with a marginal recovery of manufacturing output, exports and confidence 
indicators in different economies, particularly in Asia. It is possible that these signs may be 
just another stage in the volatility shown by the markets in the past several quarters, and new 
stressful situations may arise that could worsen the already precarious situation of the world 
economy. Meanwhile, if the rebound of stock markets and the reduced risk aversion are solid 
indications that uncertainty is fading out, a more widespread recovery of global output and 
demand may be seen in the short run at the global level.  
The materialization of some of these risks could have important implications on the domestic 
economy,  mainly  consumers  and  entrepreneurs’  expectations  possibly  taking  longer  than 
predicted to improve, or the economy quickly recovering from its current state.  
Aside from the risks inherent to the short-run performance of the economy, there are doubts 
regarding  the  medium-term  effectiveness  of  the  measures  adopted  to  try  to  resolve  the 
international  crisis,  the  potential  protectionist  actions  by  governments  and  a  possible 
deflation in developed economies that may delay decisions to consume and invest. Global 
imbalances are still present, and there is also the risk of high global inflationary pressures in 
the medium term if the large fiscal and monetary stimulus packages in the developed world 
are not properly managed. 
Domestically, we cannot rule out that, facing a relief in global uncertainty, the magnitude of 
the  macroeconomic 
the  combination  of  clearly 
expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, translates into a strong push to domestic output 
and demand. Nor can we rule out that the measures taken by the government to smoothen 
the functioning of credit markets, to stimulate investment and to cushion the impact on the 
labor  market  of  the  cyclical  situation,  facilitate  a  faster  response  of  the  economy  to  said 
macroeconomic stimulus and a rapid recovery of expectations.

Final considerations 
I would like to end this presentation with some reflections about the economic situation we 
are going through and the prospects for our economy. The worsening of expectations and 
the  higher  uncertainty  at  the  global  level  are  grounded  on  the  change  in  macroeconomic 
conditions. However, in our country this is clearly contained, thanks to the soundness of our 
economy,  with  strong  macroeconomic  fundamentals,  and  capable  of  implementing  and 
sustaining policies that mitigate the impact from abroad. 
Our 
that  of  other  countries,  has  suffered  no  dislocations 
compromising 
Inflation  has  rapidly  been  reduced,  and  medium-term 
expectations are consistent with the target. The Board has reduced the MPR aggressively 
and  does  not  rule  out  that  further  cuts  may  be  necessary.  Accordingly,  it  reaffirms  its 
commitment to conduct monetary policy so that projected inflation stands at 3 percent over 
the policy horizon. 
The worst part of the financial turbulence seems to be fading into the past, but its effects on 
output and employment will remain with us for a while. Monetary policy will continue to aim at 
reducing  these  effects.  It  has  proven  to  have  significant  degrees  of  flexibility,  always 
consistent  with  reaching  the  inflation  target.  While  in  quiet  times  a  gradualist  behavior  of 
monetary policy can be expected, when confronted to extreme conditions like we see today, 
proactive action is called for, and that is what we have been doing. We know this world crisis 
cannot last forever, and we are confident in the healthy fundamentals of our economy and in 
the  expansionary  capacity  of  the  unprecedented  and  significant  macroeconomic  stimulus 
packages that are now under way.
