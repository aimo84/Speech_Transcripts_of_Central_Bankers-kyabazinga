José De Gregorio: Chile’s latest Monetary Policy Report 
Presentation  by  Mr  José  De  Gregorio,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  of  the 
Monetary  Policy  Report  before  the  Honorable  Senate  of  the  Republic,  Santiago  de  Chile, 
7 September 2011.

 Introduction 
Mr. President of the Senate, Senator Guido Girardi, Senators:  
I  am  grateful  for  your  invitation  to  the  Board  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile  to  present  our 
Monetary Policy Report. As in September of every year, this presentation coincides with the 
Central  Bank  Board’s  yearly  account  to  the  Senate,  where  we  share  with  you  our  vision 
regarding  recent  macroeconomic  and  financial  developments  in  Chile,  as  well  as  their 
prospects and implications on monetary policy conduct. 
At  the  time  of  presenting  this  Report,  we  are  about  to  complete  three  years  since  the 
outbreak of one of the worst economic and financial crises in modern history, known as the 
Great Recession. The string of events that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers drove 
the  world  to  an  unprecedented  confidence  crisis,  with  a  drop  in  global  output  that  has  no 
comparison with any other episode over the last eighty years. 
Chile  was  able  to  mitigate  the  adverse  effects  of  the  crisis,  and  succeeded  in  quickly 
recovering  its  levels  of  output  and  employment,  in  sharp  contrast  with  what  happened  in 
developed  economies  (figure  1).  In  fact,  the  closure  of  domestic  output  gaps  –  i.e.,  the 
difference between actual and trend growth – that a year ago we expected to occur over the 
course  of  2011,  took  place  in  the  first  part  of  the  year.  The  unemployment  rate  has  fallen 
rapidly and is now below its historic average. 
Inflation,  meanwhile,  has  concluded  a  process  of  convergence  to  the  3-percent  target. 
Inflation fears resurfaced during the first quarter of this year, but subsided after the Board’s 
monetary  policy  decisions  and  the  changes  in  the  external  macroeconomic  scenario.  We 
have thus arrived at a situation where the monetary policy interest rate (MPR) stands within a 
range that is considered normal. 
However, the events of 2008 still cast their shadow over the world economic outlook. Despite 
the  time  elapsed  and  the  economic  and  financial  measures  adopted  by  economic  policy-
makers around the world, we are still seeing the aftereffects of this episode. The underlying 
problems that caused the disaster have not been totally resolved, and continue to hold back 
the  recovery  of  private  demand.  Added  to  this  is  the  erosion  of  trust  in  the  public  finance 
management in some Eurozone members and in the U.S., which prompted a new episode of 
financial stress in early August, and still another one a few days ago. 
The  world  economy  is  going  through  an  extremely  complex  situation.  Certainly,  Chile  has 
tools to soften the impact of adverse external conditions. But as we have said time and again 
in the past, we are not and cannot be immune to what happens outside our borders. We can 
mitigate its effects, but we cannot avoid them altogether. Therefore, the external situation is 
likely  to  have  repercussions  on  our  economy  and,  consequently,  on  our  monetary  policy 
conduct. As I just mentioned, at the August meeting the Board withdrew the tightening bias 
on the MPR it had communicated in previous minutes, which has reflected in the behavior of 
market interest rates. 
The baseline scenario I will be presenting in a moment assumes that the world economy will 
grow  less  than  we  anticipated  just  three  months  ago.  First-half  output  figures  were  pretty

weak in the developed world. Recent financial turmoil could aggravate in the second half of 
the year. Developed economies’ households continue to tighten their belts in order to reduce 
their massive debts, but, in turn, this deleveraging process is restraining growth in domestic 
demand  and  employment,  prolonging  balance  sheet  vulnerability.  In  addition,  the  fiscal 
position of these economies has deteriorated after several years of fiscal deficit. Remedying 
this situation will call for substantial adjustments in their public finances. Some of them could 
be done in the medium term, for instance in the United States, while others need immediate 
action, as is the case in some emerging European economies. In moments of weak private 
demand, these adjustments could postpone the much expected recovery even further.  
Add  to  this  that  monetary  policy  interest  rates  are  at  their  all-time  lows,  with  which  the 
capacity  of  central  banks  to  increase  the  stimulus  is  also  limited.  In  short,  the  tools 
traditionally used to boost growth have little room for maneuver in the developed world. 
Another  source  of  risks  that  is  being  increasingly  debated  is  the  possibility  of  developed 
economies,  especially  the  U.S.,  enduring  a  long  time  of  slow  growth.  Excessive  private 
debts,  particularly  of  households, and  public debt,  combined  with  weak  labor  markets,  are 
determinants of this assessment. This could shape a similar situation to that of Japan after 
the bursting of its housing bubble in the late 1980s, which gave way to a period of stagnation 
that has seen no end. Although we believe this to be an unlikely scenario, its consequences 
on the global economy could be severe. 
Amidst  these  conditions,  emerging  economies  continue  to  grow  strongly.  The  risks  of 
overheating  we  saw  only  a  few  months  back  have  diminished,  partly  because  of  the  very 
action of the adopted economic policies and, especially, of monetary measures. There are 
still risks, however. For one, it is obvious that if developed economies continue to lag, the 
external demand facing the emerging world will fall, hurting their growth potential. Although in 
the current scenario some dynamism and a certain degree of decoupling are expected, this 
cannot go on indefinitely. 
Given the weakness of domestic demands in developed countries, they rely on their exports 
to grow and to resolve their global imbalances. This puts pressure on emerging economies’ 
exchange rates and external accounts. This is one element we have seen in the past year, 
with parities against the dollar posting the greatest appreciations of the last decade (figure 2). 
So far, the Chilean economy has been able to withstand this challenge, but the risk of these 
pressures  intensifying  is  still latent. The  real  exchange  rate  has  risen  after  the  announced 
intervention early this year, and now its level is near its average of the past 15 to 20 years 
(figure 3).  
Among  the  policies  that  emerging  economies  have  used  to  mitigate  the  impact  on  their 
currencies has been the adoption of foreign exchange measures. These have taken a variety 
of  forms,  including  foreign  currency  purchases  and  the  implementation  of  administrative 
measures. In Chile, in early January, we announced a program of reserves accumulation of 
12 billion dollars, which will be completed over the course of this year. This is the equivalent 
of 5 GDP points, the largest since the first half of the 1990s (figure 4). To this date, we have 
already made purchases amounting somewhat more than 8.5 billion U.S. dollars. 
This program serves two purposes. The first, as we emphasized in the announcement, is to 
transitorily attenuate the appreciation of the peso. This should allow the productive sector to 
make the necessary adjustments within a context in which these pressures could remain for 
a long time. The program did have an effect on the peso. Without the intervention, it would 
have appreciated further. However, as proven by the evidence, and as our communication 
highlighted,  taking  this  kind  of  measures  grants  no  permanent  solution.  The  solution  must 
necessarily come from improvements in competitiveness and productivity. 
The second purpose of the program is to strengthen our international liquidity position. This 
means having the tools to deal with external turbulences. All the available evidence shows 
that a strong international reserves position helps to protect the economy of financial shocks 
coming from abroad, which in turn reduces the risk premiums of the economy. In our present 
2 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches
conjuncture, the level of reserves we are pursuing with the program sets us on a very good 
foot in case of a major global disruption. 
Holding reserves is tantamount to having an insurance policy. During the good times, it bears 
a cost associated with the differential between the yield of foreign liquid and safe assets, and 
the  cost  of  the  domestic  liabilities  that  finance  them.  However,  during  episodes  of  global 
recession  and  financial  stress,  the  available  reserves  permit  to  cushion  the  impact  of  the 
shock  on  the  cost  of  the  country’s  external  financing  and  provide  increased  flexibility  to 
economic policies to mitigate the effects on the domestic economy. 
Fluctuations in the international value of the peso cause significant volatility of our accounting 
results, as we have seen in recent years. In good times, the peso tends to appreciate, which 
generates  accounting  losses  as  the  net  worth  is  measured  in  pesos  due  to  the  effect  of 
reserves revaluation. But during times of global slowdown and increased financial stress, the 
opposite occurs, with a peso depreciation and greater net worth in the books (figure 5). 
As is typical of our yearly account to the Senate, in this Report we present the evolution of 
the Bank’s balance sheet and its prospects for the next year. In the baseline scenario, if the 
gap between external and internal interest rates remains, we expect that the profitability of 
our  assets  will  continue  to  fall  short  of  the  cost  of  our  liabilities.  Although  we  foresee  no 
further deterioration in the Bank’s equity, it will continue to be negative. The recent increase 
in  international  reserves  has  a  negative  effect  on  these  results,  but  it  has  to  its  favor  the 
intangible  benefit  of  a  strengthened  liquidity  position.  However,  as  we  said  when  we 
announced the intervention program, the level of international reserves we will reach by the 
end of the year is close to the limits that can be absorbed by our equity position. Still, this net 
worth – which originates mainly in the costly financial crisis of the 1980s – has not been an 
obstacle for the Bank to conduct its monetary policy with independence and flexibility. 
To sum up, we face a complex external scenario. Doubts about how it will unfold and how it 
will affect the Chilean economy advise acting with prudence, but the Board is convinced that 
the country is on a good stand to deal with it. In the baseline scenario I will present to you in 
a  moment,  we  assume  that  the  effects  of  the  external  scenario  will  be  limited,  and  the 
Chilean economy will grow close to its trend, with inflation near the target. 
Now I will describe the factors that shape this baseline scenario and the implications of the 
risks I have mentioned. 
Macroeconomic scenario 
In Chile, the dynamism of output and demand moderated further during the second quarter, 
although somewhat less than had been forecast in June. Inflation, meanwhile, was slightly 
below  expectations  of  a  few  months  earlier.  Headline  y-o-y  inflation  has  hovered  around 
3 percent, while the annual growth rates of core measures remain contained (figure 6). The 
inflation  outlook  has  been  characterized  by  limited  transmission  of  food  prices  to  the  local 
market. Similarly, the propagation of the price increases of these goods and fuels to other 
prices has been in line with projections. 
As  I  said  a  while  ago,  the  external  scenario  has  brought  important  news,  with  the 
materialization  of  some  of  the  risks  considered  in  the  last  quarters.  This,  coupled  with 
prospects of slower growth in developed economies and concerns about the debt spreading 
to Central Europe, has had a significant impact on global financial markets. The sovereign 
spreads  of  several  Eurozone  members,  like  the  premiums  of  some  banks,  are  in  all-time 
highs  (figure  7).  Asset  prices  have  seen  substantial  changes,  where  worth  noting  is  the 
decline in interest rates on long-term T-bonds of several developed economies that act as 
safe  havens.  Stock  exchanges  have  dropped  significantly  at  the  global  level  (figure  8).  To 
this is added, to a lesser extent, the strengthening of the dollar against some currencies, and 
the strong appreciation of gold and the Swiss franc, also used as safe havens. Finally, it is 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 3
worth mentioning the decline in commodity prices, with the exceptions of agricultural goods 
and, again, gold (figure 9).  
Domestically,  some  variables  of  local  financial  markets  have  felt  the  external  turmoil.  The 
Stock  exchange  has  experienced  significant  setbacks  and  interest  rates  on  Treasury  and 
Central Bank documents have fallen sharply (figure 10). The money and interbank markets 
have continued to operate normally, and liquidity conditions in both dollars and pesos have 
been unaffected by the increase in interbank premiums in developed markets. The peso, with 
swings, stands now close to its levels at the statistical cutoff of June’s Report. 
In light of these developments, output figures for the second quarter and advanced indicators 
for the third – which are still weak in developed economies – , the baseline scenario revises 
downward  by  0.2 percentage  points  the  world  growth  estimate  for  2011,  and  by  half  a 
percentage point the one for next year (table 1). 
The biggest change is for the U.S., where, aside from the low growth seen thus far, there is 
the incidence of foreseeable fiscal adjustments after the approval of the higher limit for public 
borrowing. Growth in the Eurozone is still expected to be slow. Also, it is foreseen that the 
weakening of the developed world will have an impact on emerging economies which, in any 
case, will continue to outperform their developed counterparts. This projected world growth 
forecast  is  lower  than  consensus,  which  at  the  closing  of  this  Report  probably  does  not 
reflect the full effect of current financial turmoil. Nonetheless, incoming reports by investment 
banks do carry significant downward corrections for these developed economies, in line with 
the assumptions that make up our baseline scenario. 
As  I  said, concerns  about  an  overheating  of  the  emerging  world  and  its  consequences  on 
inflation  have  subsided.  Adjustments  already  made  to  the  monetary  policies  of  several 
economies, the weakening of the global economy, and the recent drop in commodity prices 
are behind this assessment. So, several countries have already suspended their cycles of 
policy  rate  increases  and,  in  general,  market  expectations  have  adjusted  to  expect  a 
flattened rate. In the developed economies, it is most likely that monetary policy will hold on 
to  –  or  possibly  even  intensify  –  its  current  degree  of  expansiveness  for  some  time.  The 
Federal Reserve has just announced its intention to keep the fed funds rate at a minimum at 
least through mid-2013 (figure 11). 
All these facts combined will result in that the external impulse that the Chilean economy will 
be receiving over the coming quarters will be milder than previously estimated. On one hand, 
the  worsened  global  performance  will  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  trading  partners’ 
economies.  However,  they  will  continue  to  grow  above  their  2000–2007  average.  The 
change  in  composition  and  weight  of  this  group  of  countries,  where  emerging  economies  
–  especially  China  –  have  sharply  increased  their  share,  explains  this  result.  While  in 
2000 emerging  economies  weighed  less  than  one  third  in  the  group  of  Chile’s  trading 
partners, they are expected to be closer to one half in 2011 (figure 12). On the other hand, a 
drop  in  the  terms  of  trade  is  expected.  This  last  projection  is  based  on  a  copper  price  of 
US$3.7  per  pound  in  2012  and  US$3.5  in  2013,  and  a  WTI  oil  price  averaging  around 
US$90 per barrel in 2012–2013 (table 2).  
In this scenario of reduced external impulse, the Chilean economy is forecast to grow in the 
range of 6.25% to 6.75% this year, in line with June’s projections. Up to the second quarter, 
output  was  growing  above  the  trend  and  above  expectations  in  the  June  Report; 
consumption was slowing down from its strong expansion but not as much as foreseen; the 
labor  market  continued  to  give  signs  of  being  tight  and  financial  conditions  were  still 
favorable,  with  credit  showing  an  increasing  growth  rate  (figure  13).  Our  present  scenario 
foresees  that  domestic  demand  will  grow  9.1%  this  year,  more  than  forecast  in  the  last 
Report. This will reflect the impact of increased gross fixed capital formation of the first half, 
especially in machinery & equipment, as well as greater inventory accumulation. Compared 
with June, this projection assumes a faster convergence of output and demand during the 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches
second half of the year. July’s output figure, although influenced by specific developments in 
the mining sector, reflects this trend. 
The biggest impact of the change in external conditions will be visible in GDP growth of 2012. 
For  then,  the  baseline  scenario  assumes  that  GDP  will  grow  in  the  4.25%  to  5.25%  range 
(table  3).  The  slowdown  from  this  year  responds  to  a  number  of  factors.  First  there  is  the 
convergence to expansion figures consistent with trend growth, which the Board continues to 
estimate around 5 percent. Such convergence reflects the normalization of both the durable 
components  of  aggregate  demand  and  the  MPR.  Moreover,  the  effects  of  the  low  basis  of 
comparison  associated  to  the  earthquake  and  tsunami  of  2010  –  that  influenced  first-half 
growth figures – will disappear. There is also the reduced impulse from abroad we will see in 
the coming quarters, which I have already mentioned. We also assume that the fiscal balance 
will  converge  to  a  structural  deficit  of  1 percent  of  GDP  towards  the  end  of  the  current 
Administration,  as  announced  by  the  authorities  and  in  conformity  with  the  Fiscal 
Accountability Law. 
This  change  in  external  conditions  has  also  triggered  significant  changes  in  the  inflation 
outlook,  especially  in  the  short  run.  In  the  baseline  scenario,  the  increase  in  y-o-y  CPI 
inflation towards the end of the year will be less than forecast in June, mainly responding to 
the lower price of fuels. Accordingly, by year’s end, CPI inflation will be 3.3 percent instead of 
the  4 percent  estimated  in  June.  Going  forward,  inflation  will  remain  close  to  the  target 
through  the  third  quarter  of  2013,  which  this  time  marks  the  end  of  the  projection  horizon 
(figure 14). Private inflation expectations have been revised in the same direction and point 
at CPI inflation being somewhat above 3 percent at the end of the year, and in line with the 
target thereafter (figure 15). 
Such a trend for inflation is based on several assumptions. As I said, that the economy will 
grow around its trend in the coming quarters; that the real exchange rate will remain fairly 
stable, in the range believed to be consistent with its long-term fundamentals; and that labor 
costs will grow in line with the inflation target. 
Regarding  monetary  policy,  the  MPR  has  reached  a  range  considered  normal.  Unlike 
predictions of some months ago, when most thought that the MPR would be raised further, 
the  changes  in  the  macroeconomic  scenario  have  led  to  a  greater  dispersion  of  private 
expectations. Even so, the baseline scenario uses as a working assumption that, in the short 
run, the MPR will stay where it is today (figure 16). 
As usual, this scenario reflects the events that are believed to be the most likely to occur with 
the  information  at  hand  at  the  Report’s  statistical  cutoff  date.  There  are  risks  that,  if 
materialized, will shape a different macroeconomic scenario than the one described here. On 
this occasion, after thorough evaluation of the alternative scenarios, the Board estimates that 
the risk balance is downward biased for output, and unbiased for inflation. 
As I mentioned first, the main risks have to do with the complex global economic situation. It 
cannot be ruled out that the recent episodes could happen again or intensify, affecting the 
financial  system  and  confidence  of  economic  agents.  The  little  room  for  maneuvering  of 
monetary  and  fiscal  policies  in  the  developed  world  complicates  the  response  to  such  a 
scenario. 
Another  part  of  external  risks  is  associated  to  developed  countries’  growth  beyond  the 
projection horizon. The forecast in the baseline scenario is less than market consensus, but 
an  even  stronger  than  foreseen  impact  cannot  be  ruled  out.  Doubts  persist  about  the 
strength  of  the  recovery  of  developed  economies,  and  there  is  still  the  possibility  of  these 
economies’  potential  growth  having  dropped  as  an  aftereffect  of  the  crisis.  Such  an 
occurrence  could  have  consequences  on  the  level  of  interest  rates,  the  speed  at  which 
leverage problems will be resolved, and growth in emerging economies. In this scenario, the 
world economy will grow less than in the past.

Nor can we rule out a scenario where the postponement of monetary policy rate increases in 
developed  economies  and  their  lack  of  dynamism  could  lead  investors  to  hunt  for  better 
returns in emerging economies. This would trigger a resurgence of capital flows towards the 
latter, complicating their macroeconomic policy-making. 
Internally,  risks  are  centered  on  the  persistently  strong  output  and  demand.  Although  the 
economy has evolved as predicted, the moderation has been softer than expected, the labor 
market is still tight – various sources of casuistic information report difficulties and pressures 
in  the  labor  market  –  and  the  rate  of  credit  expansion  has  increased.  It  is  possible  that, 
beyond  tensions  in  the  external  scenario,  the  Chilean  economy  continues  to  grow  above 
trend, leading to inflationary pressures incompatible with the inflation target. 
There is no doubt that risks are important, but our monetary policy has the necessary tools to 
mitigate the potential impact of worse-than-expected external scenarios, as it has shown in 
the recent past. 
Now allow me a few remarks to wrap up this presentation. 
Final remarks 
The external scenario is complex, but our economy has been very resilient to the effects of 
the Great  Recession. In 2009, the  combination of significant fiscal and monetary  impulses 
averted  the  worse  effects  of  the  global  crisis.  Thus,  after  a  couple  of  quarters  in  which 
uncertainty swept the entire world and hit our economy with special force, we recovered with 
great  vigor.  Even  in  the  aftermath  of  the  earthquake  and  tsunami  of  February  2010,  Chile 
rapidly  returned  to  a  path  of  sustained  growth,  with  an  unprecedented  recovery  of 
employment,  and  unwavering  strength.  All  within  a  context  of  low  inflation,  despite  the 
international price shocks. 
Monetary policy has given practical proof that it can act with flexibility and determination, and 
be resolute in attenuating the effects of the external cycle on our economy. As I said, at three 
years after the outbreak of the crisis we are still enduring its consequences. Chances are, its 
reverberations will continue for a while longer. The task of monetary policy is to preserve its 
necessary capacity to react in difficult times, the same capacity it has displayed to withdraw 
the stimulus packages in due time and prevent costly adjustments later. 
The  Board  will  continue  to  fulfill  its  legal  mandate  of  safeguarding  price  stability  and  the 
normal  functioning  of  the  payments  system.  Accordingly,  it  reaffirms  its  commitment  of 
conducting monetary policy with flexibility, in order for projected inflation to stand at 3 percent 
over  the  policy  horizon.  An  environment  of  low  inflation  improves  households’  welfare, 
particularly  those  less  capable  of  protecting  themselves  from  rising  prices.  Furthermore, 
keeping inflation low and stable permits to soften the fluctuations of output and employment, 
which contributes to the people’s well-being. Chile must continue on a path of growth that will 
ensure continual progress of the living standards of its inhabitants.  
The  world,  including  our  country,  is  living  a  decisive  moment.  Developed  countries  must 
make costly, complex, yet unavoidable adjustments. The experience of the developed world 
confirms the need to safeguard macroeconomic balances, both public and private, as well as 
a  strong,  well  regulated  financial  system.  The  fragility  of  financial  systems  and  fiscal 
accounts  of  some  developed  economies  have  caused  a  recoiling  of  living  standards  and 
could compromise their growth ability for a long while.
