Bojan Marković: Macroeconomic developments in Serbia  
Speech  by  Mr  Bojan  Marković,  Vice  Governor  of  the  National  Bank  of  Serbia,  at  the 
presentation of the November 2011 Inflation Report, Belgrade, 16 November 2011. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed members of the press and fellow economists, 
Despite repeated media announcements about the “waves of price hikes”, inflation continued 
down over the past several months and settled at 8.7% in October. We expect this downward 
trend to persist and inflation to retreat within the target tolerance band in the first quarter of 
2012. At the same time, pessimism over global growth prospects intensified, particularly in 
the euro area prompting us to revise the economic growth forecast for Serbia down to around 
2.0% in 2011 and 1.5% in 2012. In response to subsiding inflationary pressures, the National 
Bank of Serbia cut the key policy rate during the last six months. The key policy rate currently 
stands at 10%, and its further cautious lowering is likely in the coming period.

Today we will present in more detail our view of past macroeconomic developments and our 
expectations for the period ahead.    
 Mounting  doubts  about  the  sustainability  of  public  debt  in  advanced  economies  and 
unfavourable  growth  indicators  for  the  second  and  third  quarters  have  led  to  a  downward 
revision of the global economy growth forecasts, particularly that of the euro area. The third 
quarter  witnessed  a  drop  in  share  prices  and  a  rise  in  interest  rates  on  public  debt  in  a 
number  of  countries.  The  prices  of  primary  commodities,  such  as  oil,  base  metals  and 
agricultural  products,  also  declined  in  the  third  quarter.  Though  financial  markets  showed 
some  recovery  in  October,  global economic  growth  will  no  doubt  be slower  than  expected 
until recently. Also, the governments might not be able to respond with fiscal stimuli as they 
did during the first wave of the crisis, primarily due to high public debt.  
Turbulences  in  the  global  financial  market  led  to  an  increase  in  Serbia’s  risk  premium 
(measured by EMBI), albeit smaller than those of other countries in the region. As a result, 
the  dinar  was  more  stable  during  this  period  than  the  currencies  of  other  East  European 
countries  with  flexible  exchange  rate,  even  without  the  National  Bank  of  Serbia’s 
interventions in the foreign exchange market. Together with high demand for the first issue of 
the  Republic  of  Serbia’s  Eurobonds,  the  prior  indicates  that  Serbia’s  financial  resilience  to 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

external shocks of this kind is greater than in previous years. The stability of the dinar was 
underpinned largely by the inflow of foreign direct investments, as well as by the conclusion 
of a precautionary arrangement with the International Monetary Fund.

The  government’s  commitment  under  the  arrangement  to  run  a  sustainable  fiscal  policy 
lessens the risk of a public debt crisis in Serbia, which is of paramount importance in light of 
the forthcoming parliamentary and local elections. In an environment of a global collapse of 
confidence in public finance sustainability, the perception of Serbia’s risk will depend most on 
the sustainability of its budgetary framework.  
 The  slowing  of  global  growth  over  the  previous  two  quarters,  and  notably  that  of  the  euro 
area, has already reflected on the Serbian economy. According to preliminary estimates, in 
the third quarter GDP rose 0.7% year-on-year and fell 0.4% quarter-on-quarter.  
The fall in economic activity in the third quarter is for its major part due to the reduced final 
consumption of households.

With  exports  and  imports  increasing  only  modestly  in  real  terms,  the  contribution  of  net 
exports to GDP growth in the third quarter was neutral. Once again, exports failed to record 
stronger growth due to the drop in exports of base metals, caused by weaker export demand, 
especially from the euro area countries. On the side of imports, a decrease was registered 
for intermediate goods and an increase for equipment and consumer goods.

Imports  of  equipment  are  the  key  indicator  of  an  upturn  in  fixed  investment  in  the  third 
quarter, fixed investment being the only component with an estimated positive contribution to 
GDP growth. 
With downward revisions to growth forecasts for our key trading partners, the National Bank 
of  Serbia  revised  down  its  GDP  growth  projection  for  Serbia  to  around  2.0%  in  2011  and 
around  1.5%  in  2012.  The  National  Bank  of  Serbia’s  projection  is  based  on  the  expected 
stagnant economic activity in the euro area in 2012 and a decline in some of our important 
export partners. 
Global growth deceleration, particularly in the EU and CEFTA countries, could feed through 
to  the  Serbian  economy  along  the  following  channels:  (1)  lower  export  demand  for  our 
products,  (2)  a  decline  in  direct  and  portfolio  investments,  (3)  higher  interest  rates  due  to 
rising country risk premium, and (4) more limited access to foreign sources of funding. The 
channels of impact of the global slow-down on the Serbian economy are discussed in more 
detail in a separate text box of this Inflation Report. However, let me reiterate: despite the 
inevitable consequences of the slowdown which we have thoroughly analysed, we see it as 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

encouraging that risk premium movements so far indicate higher financial resilience of Serbia 
to this kind of external shocks than in earlier years.  
On the whole, we estimate that in 2011, the greatest contribution to the growth of economic 
activity will come from investments. A positive contribution is also expected from net exports, 
whereas that of final consumption will be negative this year.

Although  we  anticipate  slower  investment  in  the  coming  year,  the  effects  of  some 
investments already underway, notably those in the automotive and oil industry, will begin to 
reflect  in  output  and  export  figures  only  next  year.  However,  their  impact  will  however  be 
lessened by the weakening global demand, including that of our export partners. Given the 
still modest growth forecast for the next year, final domestic consumption and, by extension, 
imports should also show moderate growth.  
We wish to underline again that sustainability of economic growth is more important than its 
pace, which assumes further shifting of sources of growth from domestic demand towards 
net export demand, with a greater contribution of investments within domestic demand. 
 Inflation has been declining steadily since May this year. The third quarter saw deflation of 
0.4%,  i.e.  a  drop  in  year-on-year  inflation  from  12.7%  in  June  to  9.3%  in  September, 
consistent with our expectations from the August Inflation Report.  
Consumer prices in the third quarter were pushed down by seasonal decreases of fruit and 
vegetable prices. A sharp decline in these prices since April was due to a more abundant 
fruit and vegetable harvest this year.

Processed  food  prices  grew  at  a  slower  rate  compared  to  the  quarter  before,  primarily  on 
account of a decline in prices of primary agricultural products.  
Conversely, market-determined non-food product prices grew faster than in Q2, prompted by 
several  larger  seasonal  price  increases,  rather  than  reflecting  a  general  tendency  in 
movement of these prices.

Contrary to the first half of the year, administered prices grew modestly in the third quarter. 
The  only  significant  increase  was  recorded  for  landline  telephony  services.  The  overall 
increase  in  the  year  to  September  however  came  at  9.5%,  extending  beyond  the  7±2% 
framework planned for the whole of 2011.  
According to last week’s data, consumer prices rose in October by 0.4% month-on-month or 
8.7% year-on-year, which shows continuation of a downward trend in inflation.  
We expect year-on-year inflation to decline further and to return within the target band in the 
first quarter of 2012. 
Disinflationary pressures stemming from low aggregate demand will be strong in the coming 
period reflecting lower growth expectations for Serbia.  
The lowering fruit and vegetable prices over the previous two quarters will be factored into 
year-on-year  inflation  rates  until  the  next  season.  However,  being  currently  at  a  low  level, 
these prices could rise faster next year than other prices, even if the 2012 agricultural season 
turns average.

Given the developments on the global markets and the lowering of wheat and corn prices, a 
rise in processed food prices in the coming period will probably be modest.

Declining world prices of other primary commodities, such as oil and base metals will also 
work towards the disinflatory effect.  
Furthermore,  we  expect  administered  price  growth  to  be  slower  in  2012  than  in  this  and 
earlier years, though we may see another departure from the planned level.  
The  disinflation  process  will  be  further  fuelled  by  declining  inflation  expectations.  Inflation 
expectations declined from some 8.0% to 6.7% in the last two months, and we expect this 
tendency to continue.  
A fall in year-on-year inflation will be particularly pronounced until March–April next year as a 
result of the base effect. Namely, although monthly inflation rates have decreased over the 
last six months to levels consistent with the target, the year-on-year rate remains above the 
target  as  price  hikes  from  late  2010  and  early  2011  are  still  included  in  its  calculation.  As 
these price hikes phase out of the year-on-year calculation and new, lower monthly inflation 
rates are taken in, year-on-year inflation will decline and return within the target band.

The key risks to the presented inflation projection are largely associated with movements in 
the international environment and fiscal policy at home.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
World analysts agree in the assessment that global growth will be slower than expected until 
recently, but there is a large difference across individual forecasts. If, contrary to the currently 
prevailing expectations, the world economy is swept by a new wave of recession, negative 
repercussions for the Serbian economy, and the disinflationary effects arising from aggregate 
demand, would be more pronounced than envisaged in our projection.  
As regards developments in the international environment, uncertainty remains regarding risk 
premium movements, which may affect capital flows and exchange rate trends. Movements 
in  risk  premium  will  also  be  largely  affected  by  future  compliance  with  the  budgetary 
framework. In this regard, conclusion of a precautionary arrangement with the International 
Monetary Fund is a step in the right direction as it contributes to macroeconomic stability. If 
fiscal  policy  adheres  to  the  planned  framework,  there  will  be  scope  for  monetary  policy  to 
respond more strongly to the disinflationary impact of slackening economic activity. 
 Over the last six months, responding to diminishing inflationary pressures, the National Bank 
of Serbia lowered the key policy rate, by a total of 2.5 percentage points to its current level of 
10.0%. 
Based  on  the  inflation  projection  presented  today  and  its  underlying  risks,  the  Executive 
Board  of  the  National  Bank  of  Serbia  judges  that  the  key  policy  rate  is  more  likely  to  be 
lowered further in the coming period than raised or kept on hold.  
The Executive Board confirms its previously expressed confidence that year-on-year inflation 
will  continue  to  fall  and  that  its  return  within  the  target  tolerance  band  is  likely  in  the  first 
quarter of the next year.
