José De Gregorio: The Monetary Policy Report and the Financial Stability 
Report 
Presentation  by  Mr  José  De  Gregorio,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  before  the 
Finance Commission of the Honorable Senate of the Republic, Santiago de Chile, 20 June 
2011. 
 The Monetary Policy Report of June 2011 and the Financial Stability Report of the first half of 2011 are available 
at http://www.bcentral.cl.  
Introduction 
Mr. President of the Finance Committee of the Senate, Senator Eduardo Frei, senators. 
I am grateful for the invitation of this Committee to the Board of the Central Bank of Chile to 
share our views on the recent macroeconomic and financial developments, their prospects 
and implications for monetary and financial policy making. These are contained in detail in 
the Monetary Policy Report (IPoM) of June 2011 and in the Financial Stability Report (IEF) of 
the first half of 2011. 
The March IPoM stated that our economy was facing important challenges. In particular, it 
configured a scenario where inflation could post significant increases in the following months. 
We then said that the duty of monetary policy was to withdraw the monetary stimulus in a 
timely  manner,  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  inflationary  pressures  we  were  seeing  and, 
especially,  the  risks  we  faced,  would  not  alter  the  convergence  of  inflation  to  the  three-
percent target. 
Consistently,  the  Board  acted  preventively  and  raised  the  monetary  policy  interest  rate 
(MPR) by 150 basis points between March and May this year, taking it above levels forecast 
by the market. This action was taken within a scenario where some of the risks foreseen in 
March  had  materialized,  and  others  had  dissipated.  In  particular,  as  I  will  review  shortly, 
output grew above expectations during the first quarter, so we are revising upward its annual 
expansion rate from our March estimate. In contrast, commodity prices have shown a more 
benign behavior in external markets, as they ceased to increase and posted some declines 
in the margin for oil prices and some food items. 
In  our  June  meeting  (last  week),  we  slowed  the  pace  of  MPR  increases,  taking  it  to 
5.25 percent.  In  addition,  we  said  that,  in  the  most  likely  scenario,  further  increases  in  the 
MPR would be necessary, the timing of which would depend on the incoming information and 
its implications. 
Changes  in  monetary  policy  operate  with  lags  on  output  and  inflation.  In  the  baseline 
scenario, which I will be presenting in a few moments, the full transmission of the monetary 
stimulus withdrawal will help in moderating the current economic dynamism and stabilize it 
near  the  growth  rate  trend,  contributing  at  the  same  time  to  help  inflation  stand  at  three 
percent over the projection horizon. But the risks are still there. 
So  let  me  describe  the  factors  that  shape  our  baseline  scenario  and  the  risks  that  might 
affect it. 
Macroeconomic scenario 
Headline inflation is still around three percent annually, while core measures, although on an 
upward trend, continue to be contained, both below March’s forecasts (figure 1). The most 
outstanding development of the past several months has been the attenuation of some of the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 1
inflationary risks then identified. International commodity prices ceased to increase and the 
propagation  of  specific  price  shocks  has  been  limited.  This  and  monetary  policy  decisions 
have  collaborated  to  ease  fears  of  a  further inflationary  acceleration  that  we  felt in  March. 
Accordingly,  private  inflation  expectations  show  a  decline  in  the  last  two  months,  although 
some remain above the target (figure 2).  
First-quarter  data  showed  a  fast  expansion  of  domestic  output  and  demand,  exceeding 
March’s  expectations.  Partial  indicators  for  the  second  quarter  reflect  an  economy  that 
continues  to  grow  strongly  but  shows  some  recent  moderation.  Worth  noting  is  the  strong 
dynamism  of  private  consumption  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  the  machinery  and  equipment 
component  of  investment.  Consumption  evolves  in  line  with  fundamentals,  particularly  the 
increase in household income, given that both employment and wages continue on the rise. 
Financial conditions are still favorable. 
The  baseline  scenario  assumes  that  GDP  will  grow  this  year  between  6 percent  and 
7 percent.  This  range  is  higher  than  foreseen  in  March,  consistently  with  the  upward  bias 
then  identified.  This  higher  growth  forecast  is  based  on  actual  first-quarter  figures  that 
exceeded estimates. For the rest of the year, the pace of expansion of demand will moderate 
as  forecast  in  March.  In  particular,  the  speed  of  growth  in  the  GDP  of  sectors  other  than 
natural resources will quickly approach the trend rate, which is still estimated at five percent. 
This  scenario  assumes  that,  on  average,  output  gaps  will  remain  closed  throughout  the 
projection horizon. 
On  the  demand  side,  the  stronger  growth  during  the  first  quarter  obeyed  primarily  to  the 
acceleration  of  private  consumption.  The  baseline  scenario  assumes  that  in  2011  this 
expenditure component will grow more than forecast in March, although with a slowdown in 
durable consumption. This latter component has shown some early signs of moderating, as 
can be inferred from the behavior of car sales, among other factors. Overall, the expected 
expansion  of  consumption  will  have  a  significant  incidence  on  domestic  demand  growth, 
which  will  increase  8.5 percent  in  the  year.  Gross  fixed  capital  formation  will  reduce  its 
incidence on GDP growth, but will continue rising at double-digit annual rates, so investment 
– at 2003 prices – will be somewhat less than 30 percent of GDP. Volume exports of goods 
and  services  will  increase  around  7 percent  this  year,  with  the  non-mining  component 
increasing  more.  In  the  case  of  the  public  sector,  the  baseline  scenario  assumes  that  the 
structural  deficit  will  converge  to  one  percent  of  GDP  towards  the  end  of  the  present 
Administration, as has been announced by the respective authority (table 1). 
Global conditions, particularly the terms of trade, our trading partners’ growth and external 
financing, are still favorable to Chile, but some negative risks have intensified. At the same 
time, the dichotomy between developed and emerging economies has widened in terms of 
growth  prospects  and  interest  rates.  In  addition,  inflation  figures  have  increased  further  in 
several countries, but, the same as in Chile, the widespread concerns we saw early this year 
over the future of the inflation scenario have eased.  
In the external scenario, unlike previous Monetary Policy Reports, this time projections match 
market consensus, because the latter were revised downward. On aggregate, world growth 
forecasts for the next two years are unchanged from March. However, there are significant 
changes in its breakdown. World GDP will grow slightly more than 4% in the two-year period 
2011–2012, with a milder expansion of the United States and Japan, which will be offset by 
somewhat faster growth in emerging economies (table 2). 
Perceived weakness in the developed world has affected commodity prices, which stopped 
increasing as fast as they had since mid 2010, and there have been some revisions in the 
margin.  They  are  still  in  record  highs,  however,  mainly  obeying  to  strong  demand  in 
emerging economies and some supply-side problems (figure 3). The WTI oil barrel hit a high 
of US$114 in late April, then it fell, and at the closing of this Report it is somewhat below 
US$100. Food prices, according to the FAO aggregate index, peaked in February, and have 
2 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches
fluctuated around that level since. The baseline scenario assumes that commodity prices will 
remain fairly constant over the next two years. 
The interest rate differential between developed and emerging economies has continued to 
widen at all maturities (figure 4). The dollar has depreciated further and emerging currencies 
have appreciated accordingly. The peso/dollar parity has not escaped this trend, although in 
its case it has been milder. The real exchange rate has posted a marginal increase (figure 5). 
This increase in the exchange rate is somewhat bigger if compared with its level before the 
CBC began its foreign currency purchase program. The persistently weak dollar at the global 
level has resulted in the real exchange rates of various economies hitting or approaching the 
record  lows  of  the  last  decade  (figure  6).  Hence,  Chile’s  real  exchange  rate  is  in  levels 
consistent  with  its  long-term  fundamentals.  The  baseline  scenario  uses  as  a  working 
assumption that it will remain flat over the coming quarters. 
In  recent  months,  inflation  has  continued  to  be  dominated  by  increases  in  the  prices  of 
foodstuffs  and  fuels.  Around  two  thirds  of  inflation  accumulated  between  March  and  May 
owes to these two factors combined (figure 7). Core inflation, particularly the CPIX1 variation, 
is still limited, showing no unusual propagation of these shocks. 
The baseline scenario assumes that headline inflation will rise somewhat less than forecast 
in March. CPI inflation will end the year at four percent, to remain fairly constant for some 
months. In 2012, it should converge to three percent and stay near the target until the end of 
the projection horizon, this time the second quarter of 2013. Core inflation is expected to rise 
further and gradually converge to three percent. Private projections are consistent with this 
scenario  of  lower  inflation  throughout  the  projection  horizon  (figure  8).  This  projection  is 
based  on  the  assumption  that,  on  average,  output  gaps  will  be  closed  throughout  the 
projection horizon, and that the propagation of specific price shocks will continue to match 
the historic average, as it has in recent months. As for monetary policy, forecasts use as a 
working assumption that the monetary policy rate will follow a path comparable to the one 
that can be inferred from several expectation indicators (figure 9). 
As  usual,  there  are  risks  that  may  cause  the  macroeconomic  scenario  described  here  to 
deviate  from  projections.  On  this  occasion,  the  Board  estimates  that  the  risk  balance  for 
inflation and output is unbiased. 
Although milder than in March, one important risk is the persistence and propagation of the 
specific  price  shocks  of  the  past  few  quarters.  While  fairly  stable  commodity  prices  are 
assumed for external markets, a scenario of higher prices significantly affecting local inflation 
because  of  the  current  status  of  output  gaps  cannot  be  ruled  out.  The  labor  market  is 
showing important strength, with the rate of unemployment in low levels by historic standards 
and a substantial increase in employment, while various sources of information speak of the 
difficulties in hiring skilled labor in some regions and economic sectors. The y-o-y increase in 
wages  is  up  from  end-of  2010  (figure  10).  However,  the  combination  of  increased 
employment,  higher  wages  and  stronger  economic  growth  has  allowed  unit  labor  costs  to 
vary in line with the inflation target. Accordingly, the behavior of the labor market must be 
closely monitored in order to prevent the incubation of inflationary pressures. 
The evolution of output and demand is also important in this setting. If they keep on growing 
as strongly as they did in the first quarter, an over-utilization of installed capacity may result, 
generating  inflationary  pressures.  We  have  paid  particular  attention  to  consumption; 
however, it is unlikely that the current dynamism can be sustained very long. From a longer 
perspective, the recent increase in consumption may be responding to a recovery from the 
crisis  of  2008–2009  and  the  earthquake  and  tsunami  of  2010.  Estimates  of  the  ratios 
between  consumption,  income  and  their  trend  levels  show  no  significant  differences 
(figure 11).  In  addition,  a  substantial  part  of  the  consumption  components  that  show  the 
larger  increases  –  durables  and  clothing  –  is  generally  of  imported  origin,  so  a  lower 
exchange rate favors consumption and replacement, especially considering that their rate of 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

is 
in 
tandem  with 
technological  change.  This 
depreciation  may  have  accelerated 
compounded by the low prices of these goods in dollars. 
Meanwhile, growth in consumer credit, although showing a higher velocity in the margin, has 
not posted any increases like the ones observed in previous expansion phases or in other 
emerging  economies  (figure  12).  About  the  implications  of  credit  behavior,  the  IEF  states 
that,  so  far,  indebtedness  has  not  risen  above  its  long-term  trend.  Thus,  for  borrowing  to 
configure a scenario of systemic risk, it would have to grow in the future at an all-time-high 
speed. Furthermore, households’ banking credit risk indicators show sustained improvement 
and tend to stabilize in the past year (figure 13 and table 3). Despite this, it is important that 
intermediaries keep a watchful eye in this stage of the cycle. 
These days we have learned of the severe financial situation of a retail store – La Polar – 
after its Board members recognized the existence of unauthorized reprogramming of credits 
to defaulting clients. These practices are very serious and have caused severe damage to 
both clients and investors. 
Despite the severity of the La Polar situation, every technical evaluation we have made lead 
us to conclude that it does not jeopardize the financial system’s stability and that its effects 
on the payment system are limited.  
As we underscore in the IEF we are presenting today, the Chilean banking system is solvent 
and liquid, therefore capable of absorbing the frail financial position of La Polar. The analysis 
contained in this Report also indicates that there is no generalized over-borrowing problem 
among Chilean households. 
Our analysis of information collected in the Households’ Financial Survey confirms this view. 
Households’ borrowing patterns, especially in the lower-income segments, have not changed 
significantly  before  or  after  the  global  financial  crisis.  This  is  relevant,  because  pre-crisis 
analyses  show  a  relatively  robust  repayment  capacity  of  households.  According  to  this 
source, the households that have the larger debts are those less likely to lose their income. 
Meanwhile,  after  the  global  crisis  of  2008–2009,  estimates  suggest  that  the  fraction  of 
households in a situation of financial risk is around 4 percent, close to where it was in 2007.1 
Information  made  public  point  to  severe  problems  in  the  corporate  governance  of  this 
company,  with  irresponsible  lending  policies  and  major  abusive  deficiencies  in  the 
information  on  their  credit  portfolio  that  was  delivered  to  investors  and  supervising 
organizations.  It  is  also likely  that  the  law  has  been  broken  with  respect  to  the  delivery  of 
information and the operation of the lending activities. 
This has triggered a discussion over the role  that different organisms should have played, 
including  management,  the  board  of  directors,  auditors  and  risk-rating  agencies.  Certainly 
there have been grave irregularities that need clarification. It is also necessary to establish 
any potential flaws of our regulatory and supervisory framework. 
I would like to say, however, that at this time we must let the mechanisms of supervision and 
sanction provided for in the laws governing the securities and stock markets do their work. 
Also, those responsible for the damages caused must be investigated and punished with all 
the rigor of the law for their wrongdoing. Episodes like this one should never occur again. 
This  case  brought  to  light  two  important  flaws  from  which  we  must  draw  lessons  in 
legislation, regulations and control. What we have now is obviously insufficient. The first one 
has  to  do  with  the  defense  of  the  financial  customer.  It  clearly  needs  strengthening. 
                                                 
1  A household is defined to be in financial risk when debt service amounts to 75 percent of its annual income 
and  its  expenditures  are  20 percent  greater  than  income.  This  is  estimated  at  the  survey,  so  it  includes 
households that may be going through temporary difficulties or facing a solvency problem. The data presented 
here correspond to households in the Metropolitan Region.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
Reinforcing  the  financial  area  of  the  Consumer  Service  Office  (SERNAC)  and  the 
implementation  of  standardized  credit  contracts  –  with  very  clear  rules  for  reprogramming 
and  forbidding  abusive  practices  –  point  in  that  direction.  The  second  such  flaw  refers  to 
investor protection; it is necessary to ensure that investors receive reliable information and 
are  spared  the  deceptions  that  seem  to  have  occurred  in  this  case.  The  Bank  is  readily 
available to cooperate in these discussions. 
Another  important  aspect  of  the  operation  of  the  retail  industry  is  safeguarding  the  normal 
functioning  of  the  payment  system,  in  as  much  as  there  are  stores  that  will  accept  credit 
cards from retail stores as a means of payment. In concrete, what is sought is to ensure that 
businesses associated the credit card receive what is due them at the right time. This aspect 
is regulated in the bylaws of the Central Bank. Here I want to note that the payment system, 
which  is  one  of  the  Central  Bank’s  responsibilities  entrusted  it  by  Law,  has  operated 
adequately. 
Going  back  to  the  description  of  the  macroeconomic  scenario  and  associated  risks,  in  the 
world  economy  the  recent  behavior  of  economic  indicators,  especially  in  developed 
countries,  could  be  signaling  a  more  protracted  weakening  of  growth  there.  This  scenario 
must  be  carefully  evaluated,  because  other  temporary  factors  related  with  the  disruptive 
effects of the Japanese earthquake and the oil price hike may have played a role in recent 
developments. Should this risk of further weakening of developed countries materialize, the 
difference  of  the  pace  of  growth  with  emerging  economies  would  widen.  This  would 
exacerbate  the  interest  rate  differentials  around  the  world,  increasing  capital  flows  toward 
emerging  markets  and  aggravating  forex  tensions,  obstructing  macroeconomic  policy 
making. Add to this that the risks in some European economies have intensified substantially 
these  days  and  so  far  there  is  no  defined  solution,  which  has  worsened  the  tensions  in 
financial markets. Moreover, global imbalances are still unresolved, and it is unclear how the 
major adjustments needed for the fiscal consolidation of part of Europe and the United States 
will proceed. And it becomes more uncertain when considering that they must take place in 
an  environment  of  lagging  private  demand  and  a  still  complex  financial  situation  in  banks, 
with  large  funding  needs,  exposure  to  public  debt  and  a  significant  interconnection  within 
Europe.  
Far  from  over  is  also  the  concern  about  the  way  in  which  monetary  policy  makers  in 
emerging  economies  will  continue  to  deal  with  inflationary  pressures.  This  is  especially 
relevant in Asia, where some economies show signs of narrowing output gaps and growth 
rates above the trend. The possibility of a sharper adjustment in these economies’ growth 
rates, particularly in China, would impact world GDP and commodity prices. 
The  IEF  looks  at  these  risks,  and  concludes  that  the  biggest  challenges  for  the  Chilean 
financial system are associated to a prudent management of the favorable external financing 
conditions that should exist in the baseline scenario, but that might be reversed in many of 
the risk scenarios I have just mentioned. 
Accordingly, this Report puts special emphasis in evaluating the creation of risks associated 
with  increased  borrowing  abroad  by  financial  intermediaries  and  firms,  especially  maturity 
and currency mismatches and an overvaluation of key financial assets. This, within a context 
of gross capital flows that are relatively high by historic standards and compared with other 
emerging  economies  (figure  14).  Our  analysis  of  the  present  situation  yields  as  its  main 
conclusion  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  vulnerabilities  being  created  associated  to  gross 
capital inflows with systemic implications. 
With regard to enterprises, the IEF highlights that the bulk of the funds they get from abroad 
comes  in  the  form  of  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI),  particularly  profit  reinvestment. 
Meanwhile, although the external debt has increased, the main financial ratios of the larger 
firms and the currency mismatches have been stable (figure 15). 
In  the  case  of  banks,  there  is  also  an  increase  in  their  external  debt.  It  is  worth  noting, 
however,  that  this  has  not  been  associated  to  larger  currency  mismatches  in  the  banks’ 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 5
balance sheets, nor to increased credit in foreign currency to firms whose income is in pesos. 
The  maturities  of  such  debt  have  been  extended,  contributing  to  the  solid  situation  of  the 
banking industry, despite the increase in lending activity. Finally, on aggregate, the indicators 
of international solvency of the Chilean economy – such as the net international investment 
position and the current-account deficit – remain stable with a marginal improvement of the 
liquidity position. 
Overall, in the scenario we estimate today to be the most likely, the Chilean economy will 
operate  in  a  favorable  context.  Risks  persist,  however,  that  must  be  taken  into  careful 
consideration, both because of their implications for monetary policy making and because of 
their associated risks for our economy’s financial stability. 
Now let me make a few remarks. 
Final remarks 
The  Chilean  economy  has  recovered  strongly  from  the  2009  recession,  and  the  different 
variables  are  beginning  to  converge  to  their  estimated  equilibrium  levels.  Output  gaps  are 
closed,  unemployment  is  down,  and  trend  inflation  remains  below  the  lower  limit  of  the 
target’s tolerance range, but gradually approaching three percent. Thus, the monetary policy 
rate should be around its neutral level, neither  increasing nor reducing aggregate demand 
with respect to its trend.  
In the scenario we consider to be the most likely given present-day and expected conditions, 
the  larger  part  of  the  adjustment  to  the  MPR  we  began  in  June  2010,  and  which  has 
amounted to an increase of 475 basis points, has already been completed. In this scenario, 
we use as a working assumption that the MPR will be within the range of values that have 
historically  been  considered  neutral.  However,  we  must  keep  in  mind  that  the  behavior  of 
both the domestic and the external economy in the past several years may have changed 
those ranges, introducing a high degree of uncertainty about the true short-term level of the 
neutral MPR. All in all, exactly how far and when we will take the MPR in the current cycle is 
something  the  Board  will  be  analyzing  with  incoming  information  on  the  evolution  of  the 
Chilean economy and the international scenario. 
It is worth pausing for a few moments to take a look at the evolution of the world economy. In 
our most likely scenario, we estimate that the world will continue to add momentum to Chile’s 
GDP  growth,  although  gradually  declining  in  the  coming  quarters.  However,  as  I  already 
mentioned, there are important risks. Developed economies may enter a stage where output 
fails to pick up and new economic policy efforts are needed to boost growth. The big problem 
they are facing is the exhaustion of their traditional policy tools. Fiscal policy has no room left 
for  expansion  due  to  the  size  of  their  debt,  and  monetary  policy  is  already  in  the  lowest 
possible interest rates. 
The  emerging  world  –  Chile  included  –  faces  a  different  challenge:  how  to  prevent  our 
economies from expanding above trend. Luckily, as an outcome of our own actions, we have 
the policy tools to deal with this scenario. At the same time, in case of a further deterioration 
of the global economy, we have a sufficiently flexible monetary policy to mitigate its effects 
on  our  domestic  economy  and  preserve  the  necessary  equilibriums  for  sustainable 
improvement in the welfare of the population. Our task consists, then, in properly managing 
the policies and safeguard said equilibriums. 
Therefore, and taking into account the risk balance we face, the most advisable thing to do is 
to continue withdrawing the monetary impulse. The timing of these changes will be analyzed 
at  each  meeting,  including  pauses  to  assess  the  effects  on  the  economy  of  adjustments 
already made.  
Accordingly, as it has done in the past, the Board will adopt every necessary measure to deal 
with events that reshape the macroeconomic scenario and inflation prospects. Inflation is an 
6 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches
evil  that  hits  hardest  the  people  with  less  income.  Despite  reduced  risks  of  a  significant 
increase  in  inflation,  we  must  remain  on  the  watch  for  pressures  incubating  that  might 
obstruct the convergence of inflation to the target and that, ultimately, impose higher costs to 
the society as a whole. As I have said time and again, the best contribution that the Central 
Bank can make to the country’s development is to keep inflation low and stable, providing the 
grounds for sustainable growth. Thus, the Board will continue to guide its monetary policy so 
that projected inflation stands at three percent over a two-year horizon. 
Thank you.
