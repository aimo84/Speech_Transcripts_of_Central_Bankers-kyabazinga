Timothy Ridley: Look forward briefing - 2005/2006 
Remarks by Mr Timothy Ridley, Chairman of the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, to the Cayman 
Islands Bankers Association, Grand Cayman, 20 July 2005. 
 I hope this will be the first of regular annual look forward briefings to the industry at the beginning of 
the Authority's fiscal year in July. 
First, let me be contrarian by looking back over the past year. The Authority and the financial sector 
held up well after Hurricane Ivan and all credit must go to everyone who played a part in that process. 
The banking and fiduciary services divisions had a relatively flat year; investments and securities and 
insurance  provided  the  growth.  We  anticipate  that  these  two  divisions  will  continue  to  perform 
dynamically. 
Total collected licence fee revenue increased to CI$47 million, up from CI$46 million for the prior year. 
Our  costs  increased  from  CI$8.08  million  to  CI$9.40  million.  When  the  income  on  the  currency 
reserves and the currency exchange facility of CI$1.875 million is included, the Authority provided net 
revenue to the Government of CI$38.48/US$46.93 million. This is a significant direct contribution. 
Now let me turn to the immediate future. We estimate licence fee income increasing by about CI$2 
million  to  CI$49  million  driven  principally  by  continued  growth  in  the  insurance  and  investment  and 
securities divisions. Investment income on the Currency Reserve should also increase as US$ interest 
rates continue to rise. Our costs are currently budgeted to increase by about CI$2.8 million to CI$12.2 
million, primarily driven by the hiring of additional staff to enable us to fulfil our statutory functions and 
to handle the growth in the captive and fund industries. 
The principal statutory functions of the Authority are: 
• 
Monetary function, namely to issue and redeem currency notes and coins and to manage the 
Currency Reserve; 
Regulatory  function,  namely  to  regulate  and  supervise  financial  services  business,  and  to 
monitor compliance with the Money Laundering Regulations (2003 Revision); 
Co-operative function, namely to assist overseas regulatory authorities; 
Advisory function, namely to advise the Government on the foregoing matters, and 
in particular with regard to their consistency with other jurisdictions, and with 
regard to the recommendations of international organisations.

The mission of the Authority is to enhance the economic wealth and reputation of the Cayman Islands 
by  fostering  a  thriving  and  growing,  competitive  and  internationally  recognised  financial  services 
industry  through  appropriate,  responsive,  cost-effective  and  efficient  supervision  and  a  stable 
currency.

briefing meetings with local press and local associations. 
Staffing and accommodation 
The  Authority  has  a  Board  of  Directors  of  9  and  staff  of  94  persons.  We  need  at  least  one  more 
locally based Director in order to enable the Executive Committee and other sub-committees of the 
Board  to  function  effectively.  We  are  currently  under-staffed,  most  notably  in  the  insurance  and 
investments  and  securities  divisions  that  are  critical  divisions  given  the  continued  growth  of  the 
industries. This pressure is exacerbated by the mandate to review the domestic industry in the light of 
Hurricane Ivan and the additional responsibilities imposed by the Securities and Investment Business 
Law. This issue is highlighted by the key performance indicators below.

Notes: The 2004/05 figures represented above are as at 22 June 2005. 
 
* Due to hurricane Ivan and the resources needed to tend to the needs of the domestic market, the on-
site inspection programme was suspended. However, accused inspections have been performed as 
necessary. 
** A full inspection programme is expected to commence 4th quarter 2005. 
The programme was suspended in July 2003 due to shortage of staff. Prudential visits are scheduled 
as  necessary.  Shortage  of  staff  will  not  permit  the  re-commencement  of  the  programme  during  the 
2005/06 period. 
We  are  currently  reviewing  our  projected  staffing  needs  in  light  of  the  new  risk  rating  and  staffing 
methodology and will be discussing this with Government over the next few months as we negotiate 
our Ownership and Purchase Agreements and budget for fiscal 05/06 (delayed due to the election in 
May 2005). 
We have also until recently suffered a serious lack of sufficient office space for our staff. In the long 
term  as  mentioned  above  we  seek  a  Category  5  building;  in  the  short  term  we  have  now  secured 
additional space at Elizabethan Square which we will occupy very shortly.

Key Challenges ahead 
The principal challenges for the Authority are domestically to ensure the regulatory regime is set at the 
correct level and to secure the staffing, accommodation and funding appropriate to enable it to perform 
its functions effectively, and internationally to engage with standard setters and regulators to ensure 
the  legal  and  regulatory  regime  in  Cayman  is  properly  understood  and  accepted  thus  enabling  the 
financial industry to flourish.
