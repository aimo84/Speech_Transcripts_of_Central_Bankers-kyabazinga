    
Stephen S Poloz: Monetary/fiscal policy mix and financial stability – the 
medium term is still the message 
Text of The Doug Purvis Memorial Lecture by Mr Stephen S Poloz, Governor of the Bank of 
Canada,  at  the  50th  Annual  Conference  of  the  Canadian  Economics  Association  at  the 
University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Montreal, 4 June 2016.

Summary 
Financial stability risks have become topical in the wake of the global financial crisis and the 
subsequent extended period of very low interest rates. This paper investigates the significance 
of  the  mix  of  monetary  and  fiscal  policies  for  financial  stability  through  counterfactual 
simulations  of  three  key  historical  episodes,  using  the  Bank’s  main  policy  model,  ToTEM 
(Terms-of-Trade  Economic  Model).  The  paper  finds  that  there  is  an  intimate  relationship 
between the monetary/fiscal policy mix and the dynamics of both private sector and public 
sector debt accumulation. No attempt is made to develop criteria for policy mix optimization, 
since  it  is  clear  from  the  model  simulations  that  the  appropriate  policy  mix  is  highly  state-
dependent. This finding points to the need for a coherent framework for weighing the relative 
financial  and  macroeconomic  consequences  of  accumulating  public  sector  versus  private 
sector debt. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that there are potential benefits to ex ante 
monetary/fiscal policy coordination, and that Canada’s policy framework – where the monetary 
and  fiscal  authorities  jointly  agree  on  an  inflation  target  while  enshrining  central  bank 
operational independence – represents an elegant coordinating mechanism. 
Introduction 
1.  
Doug Purvis was a friend of mine. I did my undergraduate degree in economics at Queen’s 
University from 1974 to 1978 and, in my fourth year, was lucky enough to be invited to take 
Doug’s graduate macro course. Doug was 30 at the time, only six years my senior, and already 
he had serious stature. For some reason, he took an interest in me, in my undergraduate thesis 
and my plans for graduate school, and we stayed in touch after I started work at the Bank of 
Canada in 1981. Needless to say, I admired him greatly and was crushed when he passed 
away in 1993.  
Therefore, it is truly an honour for me to be asked to deliver the Doug Purvis Memorial Lecture 
today. It is a unique opportunity to pay homage to someone special and, hopefully, to offer you 
a new insight at the same time.  
As I began to think about what I might discuss today, I found myself remembering an important 
talk – the Harold Innis Lecture – that Doug gave at the meetings of the Canadian Economics 
Association in 1985 in Montréal (Purvis 1985). I was in the audience that day. That lecture was 
titled “Public Sector Deficits, International Capital Movements and the Domestic Economy: The 
Medium-Term Is the Message.” Doug certainly held that fiscal policy was an effective tool for 
economic stabilization, but he drew us to a very important caveat – that stimulative fiscal policy 
meant government borrowing, and the accumulation of debt through that channel would one 
day have important side effects not captured in most macroeconomic models at the time. As 
Doug  showed,  these  cumulative  debt  dynamics  would,  in  time,  have  both  domestic  and 
international consequences.

Those important side effects would manifest themselves in the medium term. Many of you will 
recognize Doug’s subtitle, “The Medium-Term Is the Message,” as a reference to the familiar 
quote,  “the  medium  is  the  message,”  penned  back  in  1964  by  the  Canadian  philosopher 
Marshall McLuhan, who may have been the most famous student of Harold Innis. This was 
typical of Doug – always clever with words, but in a way that connected with a very broad 
audience. 
My hope today is to do something similar in Doug’s memory, leveraging his work and that of 
many  others  who  followed.  Back  in  1985,  Doug  walked  us  through  a  series  of  theoretical 
models,  mostly  extensions  of  the  Mundell-Fleming  model  with  debt-stock  effects  captured; 
today, I will explore the same issues using a state-of-the-art policy model to simulate instructive 
counterfactuals during key episodes of Canadian economic history. 
Of course, I now find myself actually in the job I was dreaming of while sitting in Doug’s macro 
class 38 years ago. I’m quite sure Doug would never have forecast that. In fact, he was rather 
hoping I would land in academia. But as a central banker, it would be unusual for me to give a 
lecture on fiscal policy per se. In fact, what I will do is focus on the implications of alternative 
mixes of monetary policy and fiscal policy for public sector and private sector debt, and for 
financial stability. 
The  concept  of  a  monetary/fiscal  policy  “mix”  is  itself  not  all  that  precise.  For  one  thing, 
measuring a shift in policy stance requires a definition of what is neutral, which is particularly 
uncertain in the case of monetary policy. Further, while the change in nominal interest rates is 
the most reasonable proxy for the change in the stance of monetary policy, as is the change 
in the fiscal balance for fiscal policy, both variables are highly endogenous to the rest of the 
economy.  For  example,  a  government  may  set  out  a  balanced  fiscal  policy  ex  ante,  but 
because of an unexpected weakening in the economy, the fiscal balance turns negative, which 
would be interpreted ex post as an expansionary fiscal policy when this was never the intention. 
In this sense, the mix of monetary and fiscal policy ex post is only partly a matter of plan or 
prior choice. In what follows, therefore, I use the term “policy mix” with the understanding that 
it is not truly a control variable, although of course it is possible for the monetary and fiscal 
authorities to exercise some degree of coordination of the policy mix ex ante, even if all they 
do is make clear what each is intending to do. 
Meanwhile, financial stability issues have become top of mind since the global financial crisis 
of  2007–08  as  persistently  low  interest  rates  have  been  blamed  for  various  financial 
imbalances, including rising household debt and hot housing markets. Indeed, the experience 
is spawning a new literature on how best to incorporate financial stability risks into monetary 
policy decision making (e.g., Poloz 2014). I will argue – and illustrate with concrete examples 
– that the issues of financial stability and the monetary/fiscal policy mix are intimately related. 
I will begin by reminding you of some important policy history and then bring us to the present 
day, where I think the issues Doug loved to debate remain highly relevant. 
Some history 
2.  
To fix ideas, it is worth spending a few moments describing the policy setting in which Doug 
found himself in the mid-1980s. In fact, it is better to start the narrative a bit earlier. When I 
was  Doug’s  student  in  1977,  inflation  was  perceived  as  the  paramount  macroeconomic 
problem since it was fluctuating in the 8 to 12 per cent range (Chart 1). The Bank of Canada 
had deployed targets for the growth of the money supply as a means of reducing inflation over 
time. Experiments with wage and price controls had not delivered much. By 1980, breaking 
the  inflation  trend  would  take  hikes  in  interest  rates  to  around  20  per  cent  –  first  by  the 
Chairman of the US Federal Reserve at the time, Paul Volcker, and followed by then Bank of 
Canada  Governor  Gerald  Bouey.  After  a  severe  recession  in  1981–82,  inflation  fell  to  the  
4–5 per cent range and remained there for the next decade or so. Real interest rates stayed 
elevated throughout the 1980–95 period (Chart 2).

BIS central bankers’ speeches 
    
Given this array of developments, fiscal deficits ballooned in the run-up to Doug’s Innis Lecture 
in 1985 (Chart 3). The 1970s had witnessed persistent fiscal deficits of 2 to 5 per cent of GDP, 
but the deficit expanded during the 1981–82 recession and continued to widen even as the 
recovery gained traction, hitting 8 per cent of GDP in 1984. Doug’s message was that the 
implications of those deficits for debt accumulation would someday matter. 
As it happens, deficits began to shrink in 1985, but it would take a full 10 years for budget 
balance to be achieved. As a consequence, the stock of fiscal debt continued to build over that 
period (Chart 4). The macroeconomic situation was made even more difficult by a significant 
decline  in  Canada’s  terms  of  trade  (the  ratio  of  export  prices  to  import  prices)  during  the  
1984–87 period, driven mainly by a significant drop in global oil prices (Chart 5), which made 
the process of fiscal consolidation doubly challenging.  
As the fiscal debt ratio rose through the mid-1980s and early 1990s, consternation in global 
financial markets also grew. In 1994–95, federal debt as a share of GDP reached a peak of 
67 per cent. Today, such a government debt ratio sounds high but certainly not catastrophic. 
Importantly, though, real interest rates were much higher in the mid-1990s, making the relative 
burden of servicing debt much greater than it is at today’s rates. In any case, markets came to 
look negatively on Canadian sovereign debt, even describing the weakening Canadian dollar 
as “the northern peso” in early 1995 (Chart 6). 
Both monetary and fiscal policy-makers responded to this souring of investor sentiment with 
renewed urgency. The Bank of Canada had committed to inflation targets in 1991, and interest 
rates  had  been  on  a  declining  path,  along  with  inflation.  However,  interest  rates  increased 
again during 1994–95, despite a slow economy caused in part by weak oil prices; to some 
extent,  interest  rates  rose  because  markets  perceived  that  the  associated  exchange  rate 
depreciation  would  loop  back  into  inflation  pressures,  forcing  the  Bank  to  tighten  policy 
eventually. With the benefit of hindsight, it is likely that this market dynamic reflected the fact 
that domestic inflation expectations had not yet become anchored by the Bank’s new inflation-
targeting policy, which in turn made it difficult to keep one-time relative price effects on inflation 
distinct  from  the  underlying  trend  in  inflation.  This  is  in  sharp  contrast  to  our  most  recent 
experience,  where  well-anchored  inflation  expectations  have  enabled  the  Bank  to  “look 
through” the temporary  increase  in  inflation  caused  by  a  weaker currency  and  actually  cut 
interest rates to cushion the blow to the economy from falling oil prices. 
Meanwhile, fiscal policy was tightened sufficiently to generate a surplus, and fiscal debt as a 
share of GDP began a long decline that would be interrupted only by the global financial crisis 
and the ensuing global recession. As a consequence, federal government debt as a share of 
GDP is around half what it was at its peak in the mid-1990s. 
Accordingly,  at  the  risk  of  oversimplification,  we  can  characterize  the  history  of  Canada’s 
monetary/fiscal policy mix as follows. When Doug was preparing his Innis Lecture, we had tight 
monetary  policy  and  easy  fiscal  policy.  Over  the  following  10  years,  fiscal  policy  gradually 
tightened, and monetary policy took this trend into account while pursuing its inflation targets. 
Then, from the late-1990s until the global financial crisis, fiscal surpluses were generally the 
norm, and monetary policy remained focused on keeping inflation close to target. 
In  the  aftermath  of  the  global  financial  crisis,  of  course,  the  G20  countries  undertook  a 
coordinated fiscal easing, with many easing monetary policy as well. Starting in 2010, however, 
with the worst effects of the crisis behind us, Canada’s fiscal policy gradually moved back into 
consolidation mode. Even so, the legacy effects of the financial crisis have lingered in many 
countries,  and  Canada’s  export  recovery  has  been  halting  at  best.  Accordingly,  monetary 
policy has remained very easy in order to keep inflation near its target. 
Thus, in broad strokes, over 30 years, Canada’s policy mix moved from tight monetary/easy 
fiscal to neutral/neutral and then to easy monetary/tight fiscal, until the fiscal adjustments made 
in 2016, just at the time of writing.

This quick historical sketch raises some obvious questions about the mix of monetary and 
fiscal policies and the consequences for debt dynamics, for both governments and the private 
sector. Intuitively, a tight monetary/easy fiscal policy mix means a relatively slow accumulation 
of private sector debt and relatively rapid accumulation of fiscal debt; an easy monetary/tight 
fiscal policy mix would deliver the opposite dynamic. Either dynamic can eventually give rise 
to financial stability risks, as was the case for rising government debt in the mid-1990s and for 
rising household imbalances over the past few years. In the following sections, we explore 
these linkages in greater depth.  
Some counterfactuals 
3.  
In  this  section,  we  use  the  Bank  of  Canada’s  core  policy  model,  ToTEM  (Terms-of-Trade 
Economic Model) to investigate the significance of the policy mix for some key macroeconomic 
episodes. 
ToTEM is a large-scale, multi-sector, dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium (DSGE) model 
that reflects the consensus view of the key macroeconomic linkages in the Canadian economy 
(Murchison and Rennison 2006; Dorich et al. 2013). In particular, ToTEM captures the stock-
flow dynamics for both government debt and household wealth (and therefore debt) that so 
preoccupied Doug Purvis. 
ToTEM represents some 30 years of research effort, beginning (not coincidentally) at about 
the same time that Doug began to work on these issues. ToTEM is essentially the grandchild 
of SAM (Small Annual Model) (Rose and Selody 1985), which was developed in the mid-1980s. 
SAM incorporated for the first time fully articulated household and government debt dynamics, 
endogenous potential output and model-consistent (i.e., rational) inflation expectations. SAM 
was later made quarterly and elaborated in a number of respects to produce QPM (Quarterly 
Projection Model) (Black et al. 1994; Armstrong et al. 1995), which was the Bank’s projection 
model from the mid-1990s until the mid-2000s. As its name suggests, ToTEM is the first model 
of its kind to have a fully developed commodity sector that captures economic and financial 
interactions with the terms of trade. This investment in modelling more than paid for itself in 
2015, when the Bank was able to reach an early understanding of the plunge in global oil prices 
that took place in late 2014 and early 2015. 
I  have  no  doubt  that  Doug  would  have  enjoyed  using  ToTEM  to  explore  the  issue  of  the 
monetary/fiscal policy mix in Canada. Although his preference was to gain his insights from 
tractable theoretical models, the literature has progressed with more elaborate models mainly 
by going numerical. In what follows, we seek insights by examining alternative scenarios in 
known macroeconomic episodes constructed using ToTEM. 
Counterfactual 1: Purvis’s 1985 warning is heeded immediately 
3.1  
As discussed above, Doug expressed considerable concern in 1985 about the medium-term 
debt implications of fiscal policies in place at the time. Although budget deficits began a slow 
decline  around  that  time,  these  efforts  really  became  aggressive  after  the  emergence  of 
international financial market pressures in 1994–95. As noted earlier, the headwind of declining 
oil prices posed a significant challenge for fiscal policy during the 1980s. 
Accordingly, in our first counterfactual, we ask what the implications for the economy might 
have been had Doug’s warning been heeded immediately, with the federal deficit brought into 
balance over the five years from 1985 to 1990, about five years earlier than when it actually 
occurred. The historical and counterfactual budget deficits are shown in Chart 7, along with a 
number  of  other  simulation  results.  In  this  ToTEM  simulation,  monetary  policy  is  modelled 
using a reaction function estimated on historical data that aims to keep inflation and therefore 
aggregate demand (or real GDP) close to their actual historical paths. Since neither fiscal nor 
monetary  policy  is  modelled  as  truly  optimal,  we  are  abstracting  from  the  possibility  that 
different  policies might have  offered  a  different,  potentially  superior,  set  of  macroeconomic 
4 
  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
    
outcomes. We are also abstracting from a key monetary policy issue at the time, namely, the 
lack of a well-defined policy target, as inflation targets were not formally introduced until 1991. 
ToTEM  is  built  on  a  credible  inflation  target  and  a  mixture  of  rules  of  thumb  and  rational 
expectations. Despite these caveats, the simulation is instructive. 
The shock we analyze is a series of cuts to government spending beginning in 1985 that brings 
the federal budget into balance by 1990 and holds it there. Notice that, given the importance 
of debt servicing to federal spending at the time, this would have meant a significant surplus 
of 4 to 5 per cent of GDP measured in primary terms (i.e., net of interest payments). Obviously, 
since we are basing our counterfactuals on actual history, starting points will matter to the 
simulations. According to our model, under this assumption of aggressive fiscal consolidation, 
the federal debt would have peaked at about 50 per cent of GDP in 1986–89, instead of around 
67 per cent in 1995. Indeed, the federal debt would have declined over the next several years, 
falling  into  the  high  30s  as  a  percentage  of  GDP,  some  30  percentage  points  lower  than 
actually occurred. 
Under this tighter fiscal scenario, interest rates would be lower by between 1 and 2 percentage 
points, since monetary policy would be cushioning the economy from the downside shock of 
lower fiscal spending. This lower interest rate profile would have had a significant impact on 
the Canadian dollar, which would have been lower by as much as 8 cents US. The currency 
would have peaked at around 80 cents US (measured in annual average terms), compared 
with the actual peak of more than 87 cents US on average in 1991. 
Canadian  households  would  have  responded  to  this  lower  interest  rate  environment  by 
purchasing more durable goods and houses and therefore borrowing more. Household debt 
would  have  been  higher  in  1995,  by  more  than  3  per  cent  of  GDP.  Clearly,  with  less 
government  demand  in  the  economy,  there  would  have  been  more  private  sector  activity, 
including consumption spending, housing construction and, given the lower Canadian dollar, 
more exports.  
What this counterfactual illustrates is that a shift in policy mix along the lines suggested by 
Doug  in  1985  would  have  had  predictable  implications  for  the  Canadian  economy.  Notice, 
however, that the lower trajectory for government debt would have had a mirror image, albeit 
more modest in scope, in household debt. Thus, even from this modest experiment, it is clear 
that the stocks of fiscal debt and household debt are interrelated. 
As for the desirability of one policy mix over another, hindsight is always 20:20 and such a 
discussion would have little meaning here. The Canadian economy was going through a very 
challenging period – recovering from the trauma of very high interest rates, falling oil prices 
and unanchored inflation expectations – and monetary policy and fiscal policy were both trying 
to achieve very important objectives. Here, and in subsequent sections, we will refrain from 
evaluating the pros and cons of alternative policy mixes. 
Counterfactual 2: fiscal policy in primary structural balance from 2000 
3.2  
Having examined an interesting but fairly arbitrary counterfactual adjustment to fiscal policy in 
the  late-1980s,  we  now  turn  to  a  more  rigorous  experiment  around  the  policy  mix.  In  our 
remaining counterfactuals, we hold fiscal policy in balance (moving the primary structural fiscal 
balance to zero) and allow monetary policy to adjust to produce the same level of economic 
activity that was observed in the historical data. The primary structural fiscal balance (Chart 8) 
is estimated by adjusting budgetary components of revenues and spending to account for the 
effect of the output gap and the trading-gain gap, as estimated by the Bank of Canada (see 
Pichette  et  al.  [2015]  for  information  on  the  output  gap  and  Barnett  and  Matier  [2010]  for 
information  on  the  trading-gain  gap).  This  approach  is  similar  to  the  one  used  by  the 
Parliamentary  Budget  Officer  (Barnett  and  Matier  2010).  Having  estimated  the  primary 
structural balance, we then add fiscal spending shocks to the model to force that definition of 
fiscal balance to zero while constraining real GDP to follow its original historical path through 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  
5 
    
a  corresponding  adjustment  to  the  path  of  short-term  interest  rates.  This  allows  us  to 
investigate  the  policy  issue  purely  in  terms  of  a  monetary/fiscal  mix.  The  simulations  are 
summarized in Chart 9. 
Because the government ran persistent fiscal surpluses prior to the global financial crisis, this 
counterfactual would have implied considerably easier fiscal policy during the 2000–07 period, 
with additional fiscal spending of about 3 to 4 per cent of GDP in primary terms in most years. 
Federal debt would have risen steadily throughout the 15-year period, including a sharp rise 
during the Great Recession of 2008–10. By 2015, federal debt would have been around 70 per 
cent of GDP and still rising – a higher level than the one that prompted market angst in the 
mid-1990s.  Clearly,  therefore, this  counterfactual  simulation  could  have tested  the  limits of 
policy mix flexibility. Indeed, such a policy might have proven technically unsustainable, given 
the starting point. 
Monetary policy in the scenario would have been much tighter under this easy fiscal policy 
profile because the central bank would be working to achieve the same path for real GDP as 
occurred  in  history,  despite  much  higher  government  spending.  In  other  words,  monetary 
policy  would  be  working  to  offset  the  fiscal  stimulus.  Short-term  interest  rates  would  have 
fluctuated between 5 and 10 per cent during most of the period, except during the aftermath 
of the global financial crisis when rates would have fallen to as low as around 2 per cent. But 
rates still would have risen to around 7 per cent again by 2012–15. 
Not  surprisingly,  the  Canadian  dollar  would  have  been  much  stronger  under  this scenario. 
Already being pushed toward parity by the steady rise in prices for oil and other commodities 
during  2002–12,  the  dollar  would  have  averaged  about  6  cents  US  higher  than  its  actual 
historical level but would have averaged around 10 cents higher during 2012–15. This would 
have meant even more long-term damage to the export sector and an even more laborious 
recovery from the global financial crisis. 
Clearly, this alternative scenario strains credibility in various ways, but our objective is not to 
derive a preferable policy path but rather to consider the implications of the shift in policy mix 
for debt and financial stability. While the federal government would be racking up a historically 
high stock of debt under the fiscal assumptions in our counterfactual, Canadian households 
would be doing the opposite. By 2015, household debt as a share of GDP would have been 
more than 20 percentage points lower than it is today, while government debt would be nearly 
40 percentage points higher. 
Notice that there is not a 1:1 inverse relationship between the debt stocks of the public and 
private  sectors.  This  reflects  the  empirical  finding  that  household  indebtedness  is  only 
modestly influenced by monetary policy, a characteristic embedded in our simulations. It also 
reflects  the  overall  impact  of  monetary  policy  on  real  GDP,  which  extends  well  beyond  its 
influence  on  household  borrowing.  The  trade-off  between  the  two  debt  stocks  is  highly 
dependent on the array of shocks hitting the economy at a point in time. 
Counterfactual 3: fiscal policy in primary structural balance from 2011 
3.3  
Our third counterfactual scenario looks at the post-crisis period. After a significant easing of 
both monetary and fiscal policies from 2008 to 2010 across most of the G20, there was a fairly 
synchronized return toward neutral or tighter fiscal policy in the next couple of years. Monetary 
policy remained easy in many countries, particularly advanced economies, and in some cases 
was  eased  further  as  recoveries  faltered.  This  has  given  rise  to  a  debate  around  the 
monetary/fiscal mix – essentially asking what would have happened had fiscal policy remained 
easier for longer. In particular, the issue of rising household imbalances and the associated 
risks to financial stability have come to the fore. 
Accordingly, we use ToTEM to conduct a simulation with the primary structural fiscal balance 
constrained to zero, starting in 2011. The results are shown in Chart 10. Because Canada’s 
primary structural fiscal balance actually moved into surplus in 2011 and rose to about 2 per 
6 
  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
    
cent of GDP by 2015 (Chart 8), this counterfactual would have entailed rising fiscal spending 
and persistent fiscal deficits through the 2011–15 period. By 2015, federal debt would have 
risen by about 6 per cent of GDP, to about 37 per cent. 
To  therefore  achieve  the  same  level  of  real  output,  monetary  policy  would  have  been 
somewhat tighter, with interest rates fluctuating around 2 to 3 per cent instead of around 1 per 
cent, as actually happened. The Canadian dollar would have been stronger as well, by about 
3  cents  US,  on  average.  It  would  be  fair  to  argue  that,  in  the  context  of  a  soft  economy, 
monetary policy might not have been tightened as the scenario describes, especially since for 
most of 2012 and 2013 core inflation was around 1 per cent, about 1 percentage point below 
target. By forcing our model to replicate the historical GDP performance, monetary policy would 
have  necessarily  been  tighter  and  would  have  clearly  offset  some  of  the  effects  of  the 
increased fiscal spending in the counterfactual – an unlikely outcome, given the situation. 
With the higher profile for interest rates, household debt would have been lower than it actually 
was in 2015, by some 7 per cent of disposable income, or 5 per cent of GDP. Notice that the 
trade-off between private sector debt and fiscal debt in this shorter simulation is close to 1:1. 
Even if the financial vulnerability associated with household debt had been lower throughout 
the  period,  it  would  still  have  begun  to  rise  again,  beginning  in  2014.  Thus,  although  the 
counterfactual shift in policy mix would have mitigated financial stability risks, they would still 
have figured prominently in monetary policy deliberations by 2015. 
The appropriate policy mix depends on the state of the economy 
4.  
These counterfactual simulations offer a practitioner’s glimpse into a difficult problem – how to 
define a guide for a monetary/fiscal policy mix that, if not optimal ex ante, at least works well 
on average ex post. The literature on this subject has employed increasingly complex DSGE 
models (see, for example, Gnocchi and Lambertini 2016). Despite those complexities, such 
models remain far more simple than the sort of elaborate model a policy-maker generally relies 
on, such as ToTEM. Thus, one can learn only so much from the conclusions that have been 
reached to date. 
A  key  finding  in  this  literature  relates  to  monetary  policy’s  “commitment,”  or,  in  common 
parlance, inflation targets. In a model with government debt, the higher the level of that debt, 
the more incentive there is for government to create some surprise inflation, because surprise 
inflation erodes the real value of outstanding debt and reduces the need for future taxation. 
Such inflation surprises, of course, erode the value of private sector savings and, in time, lead 
to  a  de-anchoring  of  inflation  expectations.  Clearly,  an  inflation  target  committed  to  by  the 
central bank (and, in the case of Canada, agreed to jointly with the federal government) can 
help  offset this  incentive.  Accordingly,  models  with  inflation  commitments  tend to  predict  a 
lower stock of government debt. As well, the credible inflation commitment gives both monetary 
and fiscal  policy  the  ability  to  offset  macroeconomic fluctuations.  Because  inflation  stability 
emerges  only  when  the  economy  is  sustainably  at  full  capacity,  the  coordination  problem 
between monetary and fiscal policy is highly simplified when there is such a joint commitment 
to inflation targets. 
Where the issue of monetary/fiscal policy mix comes more to the fore is when the economy is 
far from equilibrium, and persistently so. As we saw in our simulations, starting points matter, 
and persistent disequilibrium gives rise to accumulating debt stocks in either the public sector 
or the private sector, or both. As is well known, so-called Ricardian effects are likely to become 
increasingly apparent as private sector debt rises – households know full well that they will 
have to pay the money back someday, so they will not accumulate debt ad infinitum. There is 
every reason to expect similar reactions to high and rising public sector debt: since households 
know that they will someday have to pay higher taxes to cover the debt the government is 
incurring, they might respond to increased government spending by increasing their savings 
today and, in so doing, partially offset the government’s stimulus efforts.

This suggests that there is a meaningful trade-off in the policy space between the medium-
term  consequences  for  debt  of  monetary  and  fiscal  policies.  An  easy  monetary/tight  fiscal 
policy mix will lead to higher private sector debt and lower public sector debt, all other things 
being equal. Similarly, a tight monetary/easy fiscal policy mix will lead to lower private sector 
debt  and  higher  public  sector  debt.  In  effect,  for  a  given  macroeconomic  situation,  policy-
makers have the ability to choose the dynamics of those two debt stocks – they can’t influence 
the two debt stocks independently, but their policy choices have simultaneous implications for 
both variables. 
What we lack at this time is a coherent framework for weighing the relative macroeconomic 
consequences of private sector debt versus public sector debt. For a given economic situation, 
what combination of public sector debt and private sector debt represents the best outcomes 
from the point of view of financial stability? On all counts, this trade-off is likely to be extremely 
complex,  highly  dependent  on  the  economic  situation  and  therefore  likely  to  complicate 
significantly the choice of policy mix. 
The next generation of policy models will hopefully be enriched in this dimension, capturing 
the complexity of the underlying linkages between economic behaviour and financial variables 
in much the same way that ToTEM made such a significant advance with respect to terms-of-
trade shocks. In addition to the stocks of debt, these enriched models would include other 
dimensions of financial stability risk, such as overvalued property or stock market prices, and 
the feedback these elements can have for consumers and financial intermediaries. A better 
understanding of the medium-term trade-off of private sector versus public sector debt will be 
helpful in developing stronger guidance around the monetary/fiscal policy mix. No doubt, over 
the next few years in Canada, we will learn more about this trade-off at a practical level. 
Conclusion 
5.  
We have seen a lot in the 30 years since Doug Purvis gave his Innis Lecture. We have learned 
that there are limits to how much government debt financial markets will tolerate, as Doug 
thoughtfully predicted. We have also learned that, in unusual circumstances, private sector 
debt can reach levels that can similarly strain the tolerance of financial markets. These strains 
inevitably feed back into monetary policy deliberations, either because they have real effects 
on the economy or because central banks see the danger of making financial stability risks 
worse  while  trying  to  lessen  macroeconomic  risks.  Central  banks  are  actively  engaged  in 
determining  how  best  to  incorporate  such  financial  stability  concerns  into  the  conduct  of 
monetary  policy.  The  analysis  presented  here  has  demonstrated  that  there  is  an  intimate 
connection  between  the  debt  stocks  embedded  in  financial  stability  issues  and  the 
monetary/fiscal policy mix. 
Objectives for monetary policy, such as monetary or inflation targets, have historically been 
seen mainly as a recipe for staying out of trouble; in other words, they are meant to manage 
macroeconomic risks in the face of uncertainty, while delivering a less uncertain environment 
for economic decision making. While experience shows that inflation targets have improved 
macroeconomic performance, the experience of the global financial crisis and its aftermath 
demonstrates well that such targets are not sufficient for preventing trouble. Clearly, there can 
be medium-term consequences that must be taken into account when formulating monetary 
policy, certainly in the presence of persistent shocks to the economy. 
This  strongly  suggests  that  the  best  mix  of  monetary  and  fiscal  policy  will  depend  on  the 
economic situation, and any derived optimality condition is likely to serve only as a rough guide. 
Rather,  policy  coordination  around  an  agreed  goal  seems  to  hold  out  more  promise  than 
seeking  some  optimality  condition.  Given  the  sanctity  of  central  bank  independence,  the 
narrowest form of monetary and fiscal policy coordination would be for the central bank to take 
fiscal policy into account while pursuing its inflation target independently. However, within an 
institutional arrangement that enshrines central bank independence, there is scope for ex ante

sharing of information and judgment between the two authorities. After all, the inflation target 
in Canada is agreed to by the central bank and the government. This institutional framework 
is  a  simple  yet  elegant  form  of  monetary  and  fiscal  policy  coordination  that  may  have 
anticipated some recent literature (e.g., Leeper and Leith 2016). 
My guess is that Doug Purvis already understood most of this. Certainly, he pointed us in the 
right direction 30 years ago. So, if I may paraphrase one of my late friend’s most famous lines, 
the appropriate monetary/fiscal policy mix depends on the situation, but the medium term is 
still the message.
