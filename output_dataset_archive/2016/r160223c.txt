 Introduction 
Mr. President of the Finance Commission of the Senate, senator Andrés Zaldívar, senators 
members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, 
I appreciate your invitation to present the vision of the Board of the Central Bank 
of Chile on recent macroeconomic and financial developments, the respective 
outlook  and  its  implications  for  monetary  and  financial  policy.  This  view  is 
contained in detail in our Monetary Policy Report of December 2015 and in our 
Financial Stability Report for the second half of 2015. 
In the past few months, annual CPI inflation evolved in line with September’s 
estimates, although its core component – the CPIEFE – posted a slightly larger 
increase, reflecting the further depreciation of the peso in the period, with still 
bounded output gaps and within the historical indexing patterns. 
GDP  growth  for  the  third  quarter  matched  the  projections,  while  domestic 
demand was somewhat higher. Thus, the economy continued to grow in the 
range of 2 to 2.5 percent. 
The  external  scenario  has  worsened,  due  to  the  drop  in  the  terms  of  trade, 
particularly the price of copper, sluggish growth of our trading partners, and not-
so favorable financial conditions. The policy rate increase in the United States 
last week is the most significant development of the recent past. 
In this context, in the baseline scenario that I will be presenting in a moment, 
the  growth  outlook  for  2016  is  revised  downward  and  the  convergence  of 
inflation with the target is pushed back somewhat. This results in the September 
scenario being intensified, with stronger short-term inflationary pressures that 
should ease into the medium term. 
With  this  scenario  in  mind,  in  September  we  estimated  that,  to  ensure  the 
convergence of inflation with the target, it would be necessary to withdraw part 
of the monetary stimulus then in place. We began the process in October and 
continued it in December, taking the monetary policy interest rate (MPR) to 3.5 
percent. 
In the baseline scenario I will describe, we considered measured adjustments 
that would be made at a pace that would depend on incoming information and 
its implications on the inflation outlook. The monetary policy stance will continue 
to be expansionary over the whole length of the projection horizon, in line with 
below-potential output growth and inflation declining to 3 percent. 
Let me now turn to our baseline scenario and the main risks we have described 
in the Reports I am presenting to you today.

   Macroeconomic scenario 
Last November, the high basis of comparison led annual CPI inflation to 3.9 percent, down 
from a few months back. However, both our baseline scenario and the market’s projections 
expect it to rise again above 4 percent and to stay in the neighborhood for the larger part of 
2016. 
Our  currency’s  depreciation  has  been  a  significant  factor  behind  the  increase  in  inflation, 
reflected mainly in the CPIEFE inflation for goods which, after averaging –1.9 percent in 2013, 
has been somewhat below 5 percent since July this year. Add to this the indirect effect on 
other prices via indexation to past inflation. Aside from the sustained depreciation of the peso, 
the persistence of high inflation is also related, as was stressed in September, with the fact 
that output gaps, despite some increase, are of a smaller magnitude than they have been in 
other low-growth cycles, making it difficult for non-tradable goods inflation to make a bigger 
adjustment (figure 1). 
The evolution of output gaps is most evident in the labor market, where the unemployment rate 
remains low and annual growth of total employment hovers around 2 percent, with salaried 
employment showing faster growth at the margin. While nominal wages have had a gradual 
moderation  since  late  2014,  they  are  expanding  at  about  6  percent  annually  (figure 2). 
Meanwhile,  fuel  prices  have  dropped  and  foodstuffs  inflation  has  slowed.  The  recent 
adjustment of public sector wages should help to contain wage pressures. 
Our baseline scenario estimates that GDP will grow by 2.1 percent in 2015, within the range 
we foresaw in September. As I said, the performance of the economy in the third quarter was 
similar to that of previous quarters, so it continued to grow between 2 and 2.5 percent annually. 
This result revealed a deeper than expected decline of natural resources, particularly mining, 
due to production downtime associated to the fall in the copper price. The performance of the 
other sectors was somewhat better, namely construction and some services. 
As for domestic demand, it is still growing weakly, although a little more than we foresaw in 
September. The increase in gross fixed capital formation, where specific factors combine, such 
as high imports of transport equipment, and stronger residential housing construction, is worth 
noting. Private consumption kept a growth rate of around 2 percent annually (figure 3). 
The  performance  of  domestic  demand  reflects  that  business  and  consumer  confidence 
indicators remain pessimistic, despite the resilience of the labor market and that GDP growth, 
while slow, has stabilized. The cost of domestic funding is still low by historical standards, 
partly  reflecting  the  expansionary  stance  of  monetary  policy.  Nonetheless,  with  the  sole 
exception of mortgage loans, credit growth in real annual terms is still limited (figure 4). 
The baseline scenario assumes that GDP will grow between 2 and 3 percent in 2016, a lower 
range than forecast in September. This projection continues to estimate that the economy’s 
potential  growth  (i.e.,  the  non-accelerating-inflation  growth  rate)  lies  around  3  percent. 
Accordingly,  we  believe  that  output  gaps  will  exhibit  limited  growth  in  2016  and  will  begin 
narrowing towards 2017. 
With  respect  to  domestic  demand,  the  persistently  low  confidence  indicators  and  the 
downsized public investment plans for 2016 means lowering the growth forecast for gross fixed 
capital formation. Private consumption is also revised downward, in line with low household 
expectations  and  slower  than  expected  non-durable  consumption.  The  labor  market  has 
proved  resilient,  but  we  expect  it  to  show  some  deterioration  during  2016.  All  considered, 
consumption should grow in 2016 more than it did this year. The drop in the copper price and 
the worsened financing conditions would also discourage investment. About its construction 
component, the momentum coming from the upcoming entry into force of the VAT will fade 
gradually. Measured as a percentage of GDP, in both nominal and real terms, gross fixed 
capital formation will change little from 2015, at 21.9 and 23.5 percent, respectively. 
The worsening of the external scenario, as I will detail later, has a significant effect on the 
larger current account deficit of 2015 and 2016: 1.7 and 2.6 percent of GDP, respectively (0.7 
2 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
   
and 1.5 percent in September). This owes mainly to the decline in the terms of trade. Add a 
larger  than  expected  increase  in  capital  goods  imports  this  year,  particularly  of  transport 
equipment (table 1). 
This projection assumes that fiscal policy will continue to contribute to expenditure growth, 
although not so intensely as in 2015. In particular, fiscal spending will evolve in accordance 
with the fiscal rule and the consolidation objectives set forth by the Administration, which has 
pledged to reduce the structural deficit by about one quarter of a point of GDP per year. 
The worsened external scenario relevant for Chile is the main factor behind the downward 
revision to 2016 growth. This phenomenon is shared by all emerging and commodity-exporting 
economies, mainly because of the substantial drop in the terms of trade and less favorable 
external funding conditions. 
Commodity prices fell again in recent months, influenced by the steady appreciation of the 
dollar  and  slower  global  growth.  In  the  case  of  copper,  one  must  add  prospects  that  the 
Chinese economy’s recomposition by sectors will continue to erode the demand for the metal. 
Thus, at the statistical cutoff date for this Monetary Policy Report, copper was trading at under 
210 cents per pound, accumulating a drop of nearly 30 percent in the year. This, combined 
with a discouraging short-term outlook, has prompted a significant reduction in our copper price 
forecast for 2016 and 2017. We now estimate that it will trade at an average of 225 dollar cents 
per pound, compared with the almost 250 cents we anticipated in September. 
The price of oil has also dropped in recent months, to less than 40 dollars per barrel as of the 
closing of our Monetary Policy Report, around 30 percent with respect to the beginning of the 
year. In this case, the global factors that have affected commodity prices are compounded with 
supply  conditions  that  have  had  a  major  impact  on  prices  over  the  last  year  and  a  half. 
Considering all these factors, the outlook for the price of crude oil in the next two years has 
been also reduced significantly, to an average of 46 dollars per WTI barrel and 48 dollars the 
Brent. In September we were projecting prices of 53 and 58 dollars for the two oils. 
For some months now, external financial conditions have been less favorable for the Chilean 
economy. The preamble to the US monetary policy rate adjustment caused significant volatility 
in financial markets. However, the increase of last week had a cool reaction of the markets. In 
Latin America the mix of worsened economic prospects and idiosyncratic factors has fueled 
the rise in risk premiums, but in Chile this rise has been smaller (figure 5). 
Moreover, the  projected  growth  of  our  trading  partners  in  the  period  2016–2017  has  been 
downscaled marginally compared to what we expected in September. The developed world, 
particularly the United States, shows a sustained recovery. Meanwhile, the emerging world 
has slowed further. In China, fears of a deeper slowdown and turmoil in financial markets have 
eased, but the Chinese economy has decelerated, with some weakness in the manufacturing 
sector. Latin America faces a complex situation, particularly Brazil which is going through its 
worst recession in decades. The loss of its investment grade last week reveals the difficulties 
of this economy. In Argentina, the new authorities are facing great challenges. Inflation in Latin 
America,  in  contrast  with  the rest  of  the  world, has  increased,  limiting  the  room for  looser 
monetary policies (table 2). 
In our baseline scenario, annual headline inflation stays above 4 percent for most of 2016, 
ending the year inside the tolerance range and hitting the target near the end of the projection 
horizon, now the fourth quarter of 2017. It is worth saying that inflation expectations remain 
anchored to the target over that horizon (figure 6). 
This Monetary Policy Report’s inflation forecast assumes that, over the policy horizon, output 
gaps will  widen in the short term but will remain bounded, and the real exchange rate will 
appreciate slightly. 
The  Board  already  began  withdrawing  part  of  the  monetary  stimulus  as  announced  in 
September, taking the MPR to 3.5 percent. The baseline scenario uses as a methodological 
assumption  that  the  policy  rate  trajectory  will  be  as  inferred from  the  various  expectations 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 3 
   
indicators at the statistical cutoff date for this Report (figure 7). Accordingly, monetary policy 
will  continue  to  be  expansionary,  consistent  with  a  context  where  growth  remains  below 
potential for some time and inflation converges with the target within the projection horizon. 
Thus, the monetary policy rate in real terms will stay near zero for quite a while, placing itself 
as one of the most expansionary in the group of emerging economies (figure 8). 
The baseline scenario reflects those events believed to be the most likely to occur with the 
information at hand at the closing of the Reports. There are risks, however, that, if materialized, 
could reshape the macroeconomic outlook and thus alter the course of monetary policy. 
About the external scenario, it is still early to know how the policy rate increase in the United 
States will affect the global economy. A first look shows that the markets have taken it calmly, 
stock prices rose and the dollar lost some value against the other currencies. Of course the 
way  this  process  will  unfold  is  an  important  source  of  risk,  especially  because  of  existing 
differences between what market expectations suggest and Fed’s statement about how fast 
and how far it will raise the rate. Plus there is divergence in the monetary policy among the 
developed countries and its potential effects on the global value of the dollar. To the extent 
that this continues, the pressures for a more appreciated dollar will persist, affecting commodity 
prices and our own currency. 
In China, an abrupt adjustment is now less likely, but doubts remain about how its economy 
will contribute to the recovery of global activity and commodity prices, especially now that they 
are rebalancing growth toward consumption and services. Finally, the complex situation in 
Brazil and the need for further tightening in some Latin American economies continue to pose 
a major risk. A worsening of the economic outlook in the region would affect external demand 
and possibly financing conditions facing Chile. 
If any of these risks comes true, it is quite possible that the reaction of the exchange rate will 
push  inflation  up  in  the  short  term,  although  its  medium-term  effects  are  less  obvious, 
considering that activity will probably suffer too. 
At home, inflation has remained high for quite some time, which could affect the velocity of its 
convergence, because of both its effects through indexation and the formation of expectations. 
All in a context where margins are still bounded and capacity gaps are small. Meanwhile, the 
drop in the oil price and the reduced external inflation might take some steam off inflationary 
pressures. 
Into  the  medium  term,  there  are  risks  that  could  result  in  activity  performing  worse  than 
assumed in our baseline scenario, widening capacity gaps and easing inflationary pressures. 
On one hand, although the labor market has remained resilient, a significant adjustment that 
may slow down wage growth, increase unemployment and affect expenditure cannot be ruled 
out. Confidence may not recover as expected, driving the economy to grow less. In any case, 
we  do  not  rule  out  either  that  the  economy  could  grow  more  than  forecast,  if  confidence 
indicators recover more rapidly. This could also occur if the drop in fuel prices has a greater 
impact on our national income. 
After assessing these risks, we estimate that the balance of risks is unbiased for inflation and 
downward biased for output. 
Now let me turn to our Financial Stability Report (IEF). 
The Financial Stability Report 
Our Financial Stability Report discloses, twice every year (in June and December), the recent 
macroeconomic  and  financial  developments  that  could  affect  the  financial  stability  of  the 
Chilean economy. 
Events abroad are also important in terms of their implications for financial stability and, as I 
said, the external conditions facing Chile have deteriorated throughout the second half of the 
year. For one thing, the downturn of the Brazilian economy has taken its toll on the valuation 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
   
of Chilean firms’ investments there. In addition, the first policy rate hike in the United States 
might  trigger  a  decompression  of  risk  premiums,  including  the  term  premiums  of  foreign 
interest rates, causing exchange rate fluctuations and increasing domestic long-term interest 
rates. 
About our local economy, the Report underscores the low level of both short-term and long-
term interest rates. In this scenario, please note that the volumes managed in mutual debt 
funds remain high, which could be reversed in case of an abrupt event of increases in long 
rates. This risk scenario couples with the reduced relative liquidity of the instruments that make 
up these portfolios. 
We have been insistent in the last few Reports about the financial situation of local firms. Our 
examination of incoming data reveals a weakening of the sector. On one hand, the debt to 
GDP ratio, which hovered near 114 percent since the end of 2014, rose to 121 percent in the 
third quarter of 2015. Although a large part of this increase results from the valuation effect 
deriving from the peso depreciation, its level is high from a historical perspective. Moreover, 
the increase accumulated in the past seven years is high by emerging economies’ standards 
(figure 9). On the other hand, although the financial indicators of SVS-listed firms have not 
changed much since our last Report, debt is high and profitability is low, historically (figure 10). 
Anyway, various indicators show that the balance sheet exposure of these firms to exchange 
rate risks has remained low. 
Turning to the real-estate sector, housing sales remain dynamic and prices are on an upward 
trend, albeit with some moderation lately (figure 11). Advance purchases associated with the 
upcoming tax reform explain the strength of the sector to an important extent. Actually, most 
of the properties sold are either off-plan or in construction phase. The low interest rates on 
mortgage loans also explain part of this dynamism. The growth in housing prices has been 
reflected in the dynamics of mortgage loans, which are rising nearly 10 percent annually in real 
terms, due mainly to an increase in the average debt and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in 
the number of debtors. Notably, although many lending indicators remain stable, such as the 
loan to value ratio and the debt to income ratio, the share of households with more than one 
mortgage has increased: from 20 to 25 percent in the last five years. 
As for office space, the vacancy rate continues to grow. It is worth noting that the new square 
meters available have been reflected in more vacant office space, at more than 10 percent 
now. Therefore, the rents have dropped, a tendency that is expected to continue in the coming 
quarters (figure 12). 
About the financial situation of households, aggregate indicators (i.e. borrowing and financial 
burden) show slight changes lately. At June 2015, household debt amounted to 61.6 percent 
of income, 0.8 percentage points more than at end-of-2014, remaining on an upward trend. 
The financial burden remained stable, closing at 14.7 percent. The latest Survey of Household 
Finances showed an increase in the financial burden of medium- to upper-income households 
with respect to 2011 (figure 13). 
This occurs in a context where household default indicators remain stable. However, credits 
from family clearing houses (which represent a low fraction of household debt, at 3.4 percent) 
continue to increase nonperformance. This situation, coupled with flawed management, drove 
one  of  these  institutions  to  default  on  its  financial  and  social  commitments,  triggering 
intervention  by  the  supervising  entity  and  starting  a  restructuring  process.  These  events 
motivated an increase in the premiums on the debt issued by these institutions, but their effects 
on the rest of the financial system have been limited. Still, we believe that steps must be taken 
to boost the convergence of the supervision models of these houses, among others, in order 
to  enhance  their  corporate  governance  and  their  credit  risk  management,  to  reduce  the 
probability of new instability episodes. 
In  the  banking  system,  credit  activity  is  growing  moderately,  except  for  mortgage  loans. 
Corporate and consumer loans continue to grow slowly. On one hand, the slowdown of the 
commercial portfolio is consistent with the economy’s cycle, which coincides with the reduction 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 5 
   
in demand revealed by the Bank Credit Surveys of the past few months. On the other hand, 
the consumer portfolio shows zero growth in the lower amount segments, usually associated 
with lower-income debtors. In the mortgage category, the greater expansion of debt comes 
from loans of more than five thousand UF, partly explained by the housing price dynamics. 
Bank financial indicators show the sector losing strength. At the third quarter of 2015, ROE 
dropped to 15 percent, largely because of reduced interest rate spreads. This reflects the shift 
in portfolio composition from higher-yield segments (consumer and commercial) to mortgage. 
The  capital  adequacy  ratio  (CAR)  continued  to  decline,  to  slightly  below  13  percent  as  of 
August 2015, consolidating a fall of just over one percentage point in the last four years (figure 
14). This has occurred in a context where international banks have tended to increase their 
capitalization levels to strengthen their capacity to respond to episodes of financial stress, in 
line  with  the  new  international  regulations  (Basel  III),  or  as  a  voluntary  way  of  building 
resilience. Although Chile, with capitalization levels of around 14.3 percent in 2009, was around 
the median of OECD economies, its place today is in the lower part of the distribution (figure 
15). 
In view of these developments and considering that the amendments to the General Banking 
Law  announced  this  year  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  include  a  review  of  the  solvency 
requirements, making them gradually converge to the new Basel III capital standards, it is 
important that the banks strengthen their capital levels, for example by adjusting their profit 
reinvestment policies. 
The stress tests that we perform for each Financial Stability Report indicate that our capital 
levels are adequate to absorb the occurrence of a severe stress scenario. This scenario has 
similar characteristics to the one evaluated in the previous FSR, as it considers a fall in GDP 
in the short term and slower growth in the medium term. Output would stand at –4.5 percent 
annually  during  the  most  critical  quarter  and  would  then  converge  to  a  growth  rate  of 
1.4 percent by the end of 2017. This is intended to replicate past financial fragility episodes of 
importance. 
The results of these stress tests show that the banking system’s position is adequate to deal 
with a severe stress scenario. They mark a downturn from the past FSR, mainly because of a 
lower  level  of  initial  capitalization  and  profitability,  affected  by  reduced  operating  margins 
consistent with the evolution of the business cycle (figure 16). 
Let me close with some final thoughts. 
Final thoughts 
The economic situation has become more complex, especially in emerging markets. The terms 
of trade have fallen more than expected and financial conditions have tightened. In addition, 
despite that the economic recovery of developed countries has consolidated, the situation in 
some key emerging trading partners has worsened. 
The difficulties now facing emerging economies stem from the major changes observed in the 
global  economy,  especially  the  end  of  the  commodity  price  boom.  One  must  recognize, 
however, that the impact of these changes on each economy hinges on how well each one 
prepared to face them during the good years. Many countries incubated weaknesses that are 
now hampering their adjustment processes: high current-account deficits, fiscal mismatches 
and  increased  corporate  debt  –  part  of  which  is  denominated  in  foreign  currency  and  not 
properly hedged – , are some of the elements that make the adjustment more complex and 
risky. 
Of course, there are also strengths. In particular, many emerging economies and countries in 
the  region  have  better  monetary  policy  frameworks  in  place  to  confront  these  challenges. 
Independent  central  banks  with  clearly  defined objectives, flexible  exchange  rates,  and  an 
appropriate level of reserves, are key lines of defense.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
   
Chile stands out in these issues. Our net public debt is nearly zero, because we saved during 
the  copper  price  bonanza.  Our  financial  system  is  a  well  regulated  one  and  shows  no 
significant weaknesses. The actions of the Central Bank have provided room for a significant 
adjustment of relative prices and, although at the expense of higher inflation, expectations 
have remained well anchored, a clear signal of the market credibility of our commitment to 
keep inflation low and stable. 
But we must not be self-complacent. Quite the opposite: we must strengthen these elements 
that have traditionally been our main lines of defense against shocks from abroad. 
Within this framework, our Financial Stability Report shows that it is highly necessary for the 
private sector to maintain a strong financial position in order to confront tougher conditions. 
Therefore,  both  the  fragility  we  detect  in  the  firms’  financial  situation  and  the  reduced 
capitalization of banks are elements that must be monitored carefully, even if at this moment 
they are not problems by themselves. 
And about fiscal policy, the effort that the government and Congress have set for 2016 is most 
appreciated,  i.e.  substantially  slowing  down  spending  growth,  in  line  with  the  reduction  in 
income associated with the lower copper price and slower economic growth. More importantly, 
we see it as recognition of the need for a fiscal consolidation process that takes into account 
the budget constraints that this more complex macro scenario will bring in the near future. 
With respect to monetary policy, our policy framework plays a fundamental role in smoothing 
the business cycle. The basic idea is that if fiscal policy is methodical and predictable, in line 
with  the  fiscal  rule,  it  provides  greater  space  for  a  countercyclical  monetary  policy.  In  this 
sense, the first line of defense when facing shocks is monetary policy. That is precisely the 
role that we have played these years, in which we lowered the policy rate, helping to contain 
the drop in demand and allowing the peso to depreciate. 
But monetary policy has its limits too, which we must respect if we do not want this essential 
pillar of price stability to weaken. This is why, after having higher and more persistent inflation 
levels than we had foreseen, we have decided to withdraw part of the monetary impulse, with 
the objective of bringing inflation to the target within a two-year horizon. Monetary policy will 
remain expansionary, with the real rate below its neutral level for a prolonged period of time. 
With that, we are certain that we will continue to contribute to the recovery of growth and hold 
unemployment within boundaries. But, at the same time, we will also ensure the achievement 
of price stability. 
I would like to conclude by emphasizing that, despite the pessimistic atmosphere associated 
with the developments in the world economy, plus the cases of collusion and other legal issues 
and, I will say it, the stress that has pervaded some important local discussions, from a macro 
standpoint the conditions to resume strong growth are present. However, we must be ready to 
confront a more complex scenario. This means that every aspect that I have mentioned has to 
improve. As for monetary policy and our role as financial regulator, we will continue to work to 
pursue the objectives that we have been entrusted, namely to safeguard price stability and 
ensure the normal functioning of internal and external payments. 
Thank you.
