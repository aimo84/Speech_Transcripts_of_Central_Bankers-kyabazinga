  Manuel Sánchez: The effects of monetary divergence 
Remarks by Mr Manuel Sánchez, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Mexico, at the symposium 
Jornadas  Económicas,  organized  by  the  Banco  de  Guatemala,  Guatemala  City,  7  June 
2016. 
 Accompanying graphs can be found at the end of the speech. 
I would like to thank the Bank of Guatemala for the invitation to participate in this symposium, 
now  in  its  25th  year,  which  has  become  an  invaluable  forum  for  discussing  substantive 
economic  issues  in  Latin  America.  On  this  occasion,  I  will  devote  my  comments  to  the 
divergence of monetary policy stances in advanced nations and the potential impact this may 
have on emerging economies. 
As  usual,  my  remarks  are  entirely  my  own  and  do  not  necessarily  reflect  the  views  of the 
Bank of Mexico or its Governing Board. 
Monetary policy divergence 
Central  banks  guide  their  actions  according  to  the  developments  and  outlook  of  their  own 
economies. Most of them hold as a primary objective a low inflation rate, commonly two or 
three percent in annual terms, but they also take into account economic growth, either as an 
explicit objective or as an essential piece of information for pursuing price stability. 
At any moment, economies could find themselves in different cyclical stages and confronted 
with  particular  challenges.  Thus,  it  should  not  be  surprising  that  monetary  policies  among 
nations do not coincide. 
Not only can monetary stances vary internationally, being tighter or looser than their neutral 
references  could  be,  but  also,  these  differences  can  widen  over  time.  One  example  of 
discrepancy occurred in the 1990s between the United States, which began to tighten policy 
in a context of economic growth, and Germany, which started to do the opposite in the face 
of higher unemployment stemming from political unification. 
Notwithstanding  such  particular  cases,  there  does  seem  to  exist  a  certain  tendency  in  the 
medium term toward the international synchronization of economic cycles, especially among 
high-income countries. Additionally, in recent decades inflation rates have been persistently 
declining  in  advanced  as  well  as  non-advanced  economies.  Consequently,  a  propensity 
towards  convergence  among  monetary  policies  has  become  evident,  particularly  among 
developed nations. See Graph 1 
In  a  world  in  which  economic  and  financial  integration  has  become  tighter,  it  is  difficult  to 
conceive  of  domestic  monetary  policies  as  completely  isolated,  including  those  of  large 
economies. By way of illustration, the U.S Federal Reserve has repeatedly stated that it will 
continue  to  consider  global  economic  and  financial  developments  in  its  decision-making 
process. 
The aforementioned output and monetary synchronizations are far from perfect. Since 2013, 
which  brought  us  the  taper  tantrum,  the  matter  of  international  monetary  divergence  has 
captured the attention of market players in the face of the Fed’s monetary normalization and 
the foreseen continuation or amplification of loose policies by other key central banks. 
However,  monetary  policy  divergence  should  be  put  into  perspective.  While  the  use  of 
unconventional monetary tools makes historical comparisons difficult, the widespread nature 
of unusually expansive  monetary postures leads us to conclude that current and expected 
monetary divergence is considerably less pronounced than in the past. The reasons are at 
least threefold. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

  First,  the  starting  point  for  divergence  is  unprecedented  monetary  looseness  among 
advanced  economies.  Accommodation  to  date  encompasses  the  following:  policy  interest 
rates near zero and in some cases negative; further stimulus from considerable enlargement 
of central bank balance sheets through large-scale asset purchases; and forward guidance 
to orient market expectations. 
Second,  anticipated  U.S.  monetary  policy  normalization,  as  foreshadowed  by  the  Fed, 
includes  gradual  hikes  in  the  fed  funds  rate,  which  would  continue  to  be  below  the  level 
consistent with full employment, even after this condition is achieved. Third, the Fed plans to 
maintain the size of its balance sheet until interest rate normalization is well advanced. 
However,  despite  the  foreseen  measured  pace,  monetary  policy  divergence  has  sparked 
concerns  over  possible  impacts  on  other  nations,  particularly  emerging  economies.  Worry 
has increased perhaps because central banks find themselves in unchartered waters. 
Indeed, monetary differences across countries have arisen many times in the past. But less 
experience  with  unconventional  monetary  policy  instruments  and  the  intensity  of  their  use 
make the present situation unique. 
In any case, the dangers are hard to assess, including the complexity of timely withdrawal of 
monetary  stimulus  without  violating  central  bank  mandates,  and  the  risk  of  unleashing  a 
chain reaction of financial instability. The latter is particularly important in the face of growing 
monetary 
in  many  countries  and  continued  consideration  of  additional 
accommodation  options,  such  as  negative  or  even  more  negative  policy  interest  rates, 
longer-term interest rate targeting, and monetization of public-sector deficits.1 
looseness 
Possible impacts 
To  examine the  potential  effects  of monetary  divergence  in  a  context  of generalized  loose 
policy in advanced countries, two hypothetical scenarios bear analysis and contrast. The first 
is  based  on  an  economy  which  reduces  monetary  stimulus  in  a  preemptive  way  for  “good 
reasons.” For example, in a context of anchored inflation expectations, the central bank could 
seek to avert aggregate demand pressures coming from an economic upswing. 
The second involves the case in which monetary tightening takes place for “bad reasons,” 
such as misaligned inflation expectations, high inflation pressures and, possibly, an output 
contraction.  In  both  scenarios,  transmission  channels  to  other  economies  are  twofold:  one 
financial and the other real. 
The  two  scenarios  would  tend  to  generate  opposing  effects.  In  the  favorable  case,  the 
financial  impact  would  include  an  adjustment  in  international  portfolios  benefiting  assets 
denominated  in  the  currency  of  the  country  beginning  the  divergence.  Some  reversion  of 
capital  flows  from  economies  perceived  as  having  weak  fundamentals  could  also  be 
expected. The real effect would operate through greater external demand from the leading 
country, favoring especially its key trade partners. 
The adverse scenario would have contrary effects. In particular, the adjustment of portfolios 
would not favor the country leading the divergence, and real support to the rest of the world 
economy would be difficult. In both scenarios, the effects could be amplified or weakened by 
other non-monetary factors. 
Current  monetary  divergence  should  be  placed  within  the  first  scenario,  with  the  United 
States as the epicenter. Anticipated monetary decoupling, at least since 2014, has resulted 
in  a  stronger  U.S.  dollar  versus  other  major  currencies.  Presumably,  the  dollar  has

Bernanke’s Blog, March and April.

  strengthened  in  the  face  of  wider  interest  rate  spreads  and  better  economic  performance 
from the United States with respect to other developed nations. 
Indeed,  expectations  of  normalization  in  this  country  have  resulted  in  higher  short-  and 
medium-term market interest rates, giving rise to a flatter yield curve. This, in turn, has led to 
wider  spreads  between  U.S.  Treasuries  and  European  bonds,  such  as  those  of  German 
bunds at various maturities. See Graph 2 
Moreover, in the last two years, financial volatility, as measured by the VIX for instance, has 
become  more  acute  at  times.  Transitory  spikes  have  also  been  associated  with  non-
monetary  factors,  such  as  declining  commodities  prices  and  jitters  over  the  health  of  the 
Chinese economy. See Graph 3 
To  date,  the  financial  impact  on  emerging  markets  has  been  relatively  moderate.  It  has 
included a slowdown in net portfolio capital inflows and temporary outflows of foreign funds. 
See Graph 4 
At  the  same  time,  external  interest  rates,  as  reflected  in  JP  Morgan’s  EMBI  global  index, 
have seen upward pressures, beginning with the taper tantrum, although access to foreign 
financing  under  still  reasonable  conditions  has  continued.  Furthermore,  domestic  interest 
rates, which have traditionally followed the path of U.S. rates, have recently gone their own 
way, with an upward tendency and widening spreads. See Graph 5 
By  far,  exchange  rates  have  been  the  most  affected  financial  variable,  with  generalized 
depreciations  of  emerging-market  currencies  against  the  U.S.  dollar  on  a  trade-weighted 
basis.  Flexible  exchange  rates  have  served  as  a  valuable  buffer  against  deteriorating 
sentiment toward emerging markets. See Graph 6 
The positive real effect from U.S. economic recovery has not yet emerged. This is because 
the United States has been affected by a downsizing of its energy sector in the face of lower 
international  oil  prices,  among  other  issues,  restraining  industrial  production  and  external 
trade. 
The absence of a positive real effect has been particularly noteworthy in the case of my own 
country,  Mexico,  an  economy  highly  linked  with  that  of  the  United  States.  In  spite  of 
significant  peso  depreciation,  low  U.S.  external  demand  has  dominated  as  a  drag  behind 
declining growth for Mexico’s total manufacturing exports, a high percentage of which goes 
to its northern neighbor. 
For several years, global monetary accommodation has had a spillover effect on monetary 
policies in emerging economies, with postures generally looser than what would be dictated 
by Taylor rules. The beginning of the withdrawal of U.S. monetary stimulus has led to higher 
policy interest rates in some countries, partly closing this gap. 
Moreover, during recent years, some economies have used capital controls, with generally 
lower-than-expected results, and direct exchange market interventions, in order to preclude 
larger  currency  depreciations.  Motivations  for  the  latter  vary  across  countries,  including 
protection of inflation expectations and fear of floating.2 
Challenges and outlook 
Advanced  and  emerging  economies  face  considerable  challenges.  For  developed  nations, 
the following possible difficulties can be identified. First, incipient monetary divergence could 
butt  up  against  domestic  or  external  limits.  For  example,  the  Fed  could  decide  that  dollar 
appreciation or deterioration of international conditions could detain U.S. economic recovery.

p. 92.

  In  this  case,  one  cannot  rule  out  interruption  in  normalization  or  even  a  return  to  greater 
stimulus in the United States. 
Second,  continued  orderly  unwinding  of  lax  monetary  policy,  including  eventually  smaller 
central  bank  balance  sheets,  could  prove  to  be  complicated.  Third,  the  prevalence  of  the 
dollar  as  a  safe-haven  currency  could  weaken  the  credit  channel  through  which  loose 
monetary policy works in other economies. 
Fourth,  given  diminishing  returns  from  accommodation,  further  attempts  at  easing  could 
damage  the  credibility  of  monetary  policy.  And  finally,  the  tendency  toward  cyclical 
convergence could lead to the re-synchronization of monetary policies at some point. 
In  this  context,  the  panorama  for  emerging  economies  could  deteriorate  significantly. 
Divergence is already reflected in portfolio adjustments and asset prices. However, as new 
information  on  monetary  stances  in  advanced  countries  becomes  available,  new  changes 
may ensue. In this regard, only surprises would carry weight. 
Possible effects could include more portfolio re-composition, decompression of interest rate 
term premiums, as well as further currency depreciations. The most adverse effects will likely 
be concentrated in those countries viewed as suffering from financial imbalances and fragile 
economic  fundamentals.  Thus,  policymakers  should  focus  on  correcting  deficiencies  and 
solidifying strengths, including sound fiscal stances, opportune monetary policy actions, and 
the implementation of structural changes to foster long-term productivity growth. 
Concluding remarks 
Incipient  monetary  divergence  has  sparked  concerns  for  market  players  as  the  current 
begins to shift slowly away from unprecedented monetary expansion. Advanced economies 
face an arduous task in managing the withdrawal of extraordinary stimulus, however gradual 
it may be. In particular, historically unequaled use of unconventional monetary tools makes it 
hard to know just how this scenario will eventually unfold. 
Until  now,  negative  financial  impacts  on  emerging  markets from  the  beginning  of this  new 
phase have been relatively moderate. At the same time, however, the real positive expected 
effect of the U.S. economic recovery has not yet materialized. This is due in part to factors 
such as severely diminished oil prices. Given all the uncertainties in the present context, the 
outlook for emerging economies could easily deteriorate, and thus they should concentrate 
on fortifying their fundamentals as never before.
