   Manuel Sánchez: Monetary expansion – is the sky the limit? 
Remarks by Mr Manuel Sánchez, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Mexico, at the 5th annual 
National  Asset-Liability  Management  Americas  symposium,  organized  by  Central  Banking 
Publications, Mexico City, 13 May 2016. 
 It is an honor to participate in this conference on asset and liability management organized by 
Central  Banking  Publications.  I  would  like  to  thank  this  organization  for  the  invitation  to  be 
here  with  you,  and  also for their  many  contributions  to  the field  through  significant  analysis 
and information on urgent issues faced by central banks around the world. 
I will focus on some implications of unconventional monetary policies in advanced countries 
for the global economy and financial markets. To this end, I will first attempt to analyze the 
possible  benefits  and  costs  of  the  unusual  monetary  accommodation  that  characterizes 
today’s international environment. Then, I would like to describe some of the effects of these 
stances on emerging-market economies. Finally, I will make some comments on the outlook 
for monetary policy and the challenges faced by reserve and fund managers. 
As usual, my remarks are entirely my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Bank 
of Mexico or its Governing Board. 
Are the benefits worth the risks? 
Since 2007, central banks in advanced countries have undertaken unprecedented monetary 
loosening. Three key measures have been, to start with, the reduction of policy interest rates 
at a rapid pace to levels close to zero, later combined with forward guidance. Next, special 
lending  facilities  were  offered  to  meet  increased  liquidity  demands  amid  the  crisis. 
Unconventional  policy  has  continued  through  the  third  measure,  successive  quantitative 
easing (QE) programs, aimed at supporting growth and averting low inflation. 
As a result, central bank balance sheets have been growing substantially, reaching high levels 
relative  to  GDP.  At  the  same  time,  the  liability  side  of  the  ledger  typically  has  contained 
growing amounts of commercial bank reserves, well above levels the banks are required to 
maintain. 
In  this  context,  unprecedented  liquidity  prevails  in  the  financial  system. Central  banks  have 
played  an  unusually  dominant  role  in  the  financial  markets,  with  QE  programs  focusing  on 
domestic  securities.  They  have  engaged  in  large-scale  purchases  of  long-term  government 
bonds,  but  also  private-sector  securities,  such  as  mortgage-backed  securities  in  the  United 
States.1 
Typically,  central  banks  have  executed  these  purchases  in  the  secondary  markets,  without 
sterilizing  them.  There  have  also  been  programs  designed  to  recompose  central  banks’ 
portfolios, as with the Fed’s operation twist during 2011–2012. 
With  all  this  happening,  central  banks  have  ended  up  entering  the  credit  business, 
undertaking  quasi-fiscal  operations,  and  running  the  risk  of  drying  the  markets  out  by 
absorbing too many securities. The dominant role of central banks in the financial markets is 
clear from the large percentages of government bonds purchased each year relative to totals 
issued,  as  well  as  stocks  already  accumulated.  In  this  sense,  central  banks  have  become 
“buyers  of  first  resort”  for  federal  governments  and  in  some  private-sector  markets.

   Furthermore,  five  central  banks  to  date  have  set  policy  interest  rates  below  zero,  as  a 
complement to already significant expansionary monetary programs. The lowest is the rate of 
the Swiss National Bank, which is at a negative 0.75 percent. 
Monetary  accommodation  has  led  to  historically  low  short-term  interest  rates.  For  example, 
the  distribution  of  short-term  government  rates  across  advanced  countries  has  shifted 
significantly  to  the  left,  with  a  mode  close  to  zero,  and  almost  no  intersection  with  the 
distribution prevailing before the crisis. See graph 2. 
The combination of negative policy interest rates and balance sheet expansions has brought 
about  ever-increasing  proportions  of  government  debt  carrying  a  negative  yield.  A  sharply 
increasing trend in the amount of government debt issued at negative rates began at the end 
of 2015. Roughly one-third of total outstanding government debt among advanced countries is 
now estimated to carry a negative interest rate. See graph 3. 
No doubt central banks were effective at providing more liquidity during the crisis, playing their 
role well as lenders of last resort. However, despite some evidence that expansionary policies 
have supported economic activity, returns in this regard seem to be decreasing.2 
At  the  same  time,  the  effectiveness  of  lax  policies  remains  unclear  where  inflation,  core 
inflation,  and  inflation  expectations  are  concerned.  Nevertheless,  fears  of  deflation  appear 
somewhat magnified in light of historical evidence pointing to the absence of a clear negative 
relationship between deflation and growth.3 
Independently  of  benefits  pursued,  extraordinary  monetary  accommodation  may  be 
generating significant costs, which could become more evident in the future. I would  like to 
highlight three of them. 
One is the potential build-up of financial imbalances in the form of excessive risk-taking and 
growing indebtedness since the crisis. Certainly, there is no evidence the world as a  whole 
has been in a process of de-leveraging, particularly with increasing ratios of government debt 
to GDP taken into account.4 
Another manifestation of costs is the possible overvaluation of assets. In some stock markets, 
PE  ratios  are  higher  than  long-term  averages,  in  spite  of  the  fact  earnings  prospects  are 
restrained by relatively low growth outlooks. Also, the gaps between housing and consumer 
price indices in some advanced countries, such as Switzerland, Australia, and Norway, have 
been rising rapidly in the last few years. 
A final manifestation of costs is the possibility that negative rates hurt banks, as well as money 
market funds and other non-bank financial institutions such as insurance companies, with no 
clear payoff in terms of economic growth. For example, in a recent survey conducted by the 
ECB, banks estimated that the most important effects from negative rates include lower net 
interest income and lending rates, as well as squeezed loan margins. The estimated impact 
on lending volume is minimal.5 
These  imbalances  and  pressures  could  set  the  stage  for  significant  disruptions  to  the 
functioning of markets down the road. Given the fact policy makers are still reaching deep into 
their  bags  of  tools  to  tune  markets  years  after  the  crisis,  another  period  of  severe  turmoil 
would likely be even more problematic.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
   Emerging economies between a rock and a hard place 
Let’s  now  look  at  the  implications  of  extraordinary  monetary  accommodation  in  advanced 
countries for emerging markets. This policy at first led to more favorable financial conditions. 
Starting in 2010, emerging economies drew greater portfolio capital flows and enjoyed both 
rising commodity prices and bouts of financial asset appreciation. Starting in 2014, however, 
with markets anticipating U.S. monetary normalization and fears mounting on the health of the 
Chinese economy, the tables turned.6 
A positive result of the financing bonanza was that the share of nonresident holdings of local-
currency government securities in the total outstanding reached record levels before the taper 
tantrum.  Since  2014,  the  trend  has  clearly  declined,  although  in  a  moderate  fashion,  with 
relatively high levels still the case. See graph 4. 
Despite  fears  of  persistent  currency  appreciation  expressed  by  policy-makers  in  emerging 
markets due to QE in advanced countries, the fact is that on average, appreciation for these 
currencies  has  proved  short  lived.  Indeed,  emerging-nation  currency  trends  have  generally 
been towards weakening. See graph 5. 
Many emerging economies responded to advanced-country monetary expansion mainly in two 
ways.  One  was  to  loosen  their  own  monetary  stances.  This  can  be  seen  by  looking  at  the 
declining levels of policy interest rates below what different Taylor rules dictate since 2003.7 
Another  response  to  extraordinary  monetary  easing  in  advanced  countries  has  been 
acceleration of FX reserve accumulation, something which has been significant in emerging 
economies.  This  trend  has  only  softened  slightly  recently,  as  a  result  of  some  countries 
seeking to avoid excessive currency weakening. See graph 6. 
One  manifestation  of  probable  imbalances  in  emerging  economies  stemming  from  lax 
advanced-nation  monetary  policy  has  been  much  higher  leverage  used  by  corporations. 
Higher corporate debt has been a natural result of better financial conditions. While the use of 
higher debt at lower rates can be justified on the part of both firms and governments as a way 
to  take  advantage  of  an  opportunity,  the  danger  is  of  a  significant  deterioration  of  external 
conditions,  for  example,  because  of  a  sudden  change  in  market  sentiment.  This  could 
generate difficulties for debt service and could cause financial disruptions.8 
These risks are more complicated for emerging economies in the present general context of 
declining output growth and rising inflation. Policy trade-offs would be particularly tough in the 
case of reversed capital flows. See graph 7. 
Outlook and challenges 
Let’s  now  turn  to  the  possible  implications  for  the  future.  Monetary  policy  in  advanced 
countries  is  at  a  crossroads.  To  begin  with,  less  than  fully  satisfactory  results  in  terms  of 
output  and  inflation  from  monetary  accommodation  will  likely  lead  to  more  gradual 
normalization and even further easing in some countries. 
In  addition,  divergence  of  monetary  policy  across  countries  will  likely  prevail.  An  important 
corollary  is  that  the  dominant  role  of  monetary  policy  in  advanced  countries  could  result  in 
further postponement of needed adjustments to contain financial risks and structural reforms 
to enhance productivity growth.

   Furthermore, balance sheets will not diminish in the near term and may even expand in some 
places.  Also,  negative  policy  rates  could  become  more  prevalent,  and  rates  could  even  fall 
further. 
Tools such as long-term interest rate targeting and fiscal deficit monetary financing may gain 
traction. All these measures will make eventual unwinding of lax polices more complex and 
riskier in terms of price and financial stability.9 
Low effectiveness of monetary policy could lead to disillusionment and loss of credibility. The 
latter effect is natural, given the overburdening of monetary policy with several goals. After all, 
monetary policy can only do so much. Some things it can do, and others it cannot. 
In  this  context,  emerging  economies  must  prepare  for  possibly  less  benign  times.  Any 
imbalances built up from monetary accommodation in advanced countries, or from domestic 
policies, will have to be managed carefully. Economic fundamentals should be strengthened, 
including appropriate monetary policy, sound fiscal stances, and well-implemented structural 
reforms. 
Finally, reserve and fund managers will continue to face a difficult environment. While risks 
and  uncertainty  are  greater,  very  low  returns  on  assets  can  be  expected,  even  at  longer 
maturities. Less market liquidity and more volatile environments are also part of the outlook. 
The duty of optimizing safety, liquidity, and returns, obviously, will be ever harder. 
Final remarks 
In conclusion, central banks in advanced economies are navigating unchartered waters, and 
thus, the overall results of their stances and their eventual unwinding are difficult to assess. 
Potential unseen costs from extraordinary accommodation include financial imbalances from 
excessive risk-taking and high debt. Market disruptions fueled by these imbalances could be 
hard to manage. 
Emerging  markets  must  be  prepared  to  face  greater  risks  and  volatility  due  to  potential 
spillover effects from this scenario. Reserve and fund managers, for their part, will have to use 
all their knowledge and talent to achieve the best risk and reward relationship possible in such 
a constantly evolving context.
