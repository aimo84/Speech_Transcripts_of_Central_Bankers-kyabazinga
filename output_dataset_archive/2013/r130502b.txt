Rodrigo Vergara: Chile’s latest Monetary Policy Report 
Presentation  by  Mr  Rodrigo  Vergara,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  before  the 
Finance  Commission  of  the  Honorable  Senate  of  the  Republic,  Santiago  de  Chile,  2  April 
2013. 
The Monetary Policy Report of March 2013 can be found at http://www.bcentral.cl. 
 Introduction 
Mr.  President  of  the  Senate’s  Finance  Commission,  senator  Andrés  Zaldívar;  senators 
members of this Commission, ladies and gentlemen. 
Thank you for inviting me to present the view of the Bank’s Board on recent macroeconomic 
developments,  together  with  the  macroeconomic  outlook  and  its  and  monetary  policy 
implications. This view is contained in detail in our March 2013 Monetary Policy Report.  
There is no doubt that the Chilean economy is in good standing. In a complex international 
context where growth in the developed world is still sluggish and particularly the Eurozone 
continues in recession, Chile continues to grow at over 5 percent annually, unemployment 
has fallen and inflation remains low. In these circumstances we must avoid complacency and 
be alert to the risks facing our economy to reduce their likelihood of occurrence, or otherwise 
be prepared to deal with them in the best way possible. Precisely our Monetary Policy Report 
traditionally analyzes the baseline scenario, and also risk scenarios. 
International economic conditions, while still complex, have improved in recent months from 
the deteriorated conditions of the first half of 2012. China’s economic growth has stabilized 
and  the  U.S.  has  avoided  much  of  the  drastic  fiscal  adjustments  that  were  legally 
programmed  for  early  2013.  This  time  around,  we  have  revised  the  global  growth  outlook 
slightly upward and external financial conditions have improved thanks to very expansionary 
monetary  policies  in  the  main  advanced  economies.  In  contrast,  the  Eurozone  remains  in 
recession with still fragile financial and fiscal conditions, as illustrated by the recent events in 
Cyprus. World commodity prices remain high, although copper has had a relapse. 
Chile continues to display a dynamic economy and limited inflation. GDP increased 5.6% in 
2012, while domestic expenditure rose 7.1%, thus increasing the current account deficit to 
3.5% of GDP (figure 1).  
In this regard, it is worth noting that in recent years the dynamism of domestic demand has 
been driven by investment, especially in mining. As shown in a box inside our  Report, the 
current level of mining investment is the highest of the past four decades. Most recently, the 
implementation of these projects has had a number of direct and indirect effects on domestic 
demand,  other  sectors’  activity,  the  labor  market,  imports  of  capital goods  and  the  current 
account deficit. In the medium term, as these projects mature and the full expansion of the 
capital stock is completed, the level of imports will be reduced, output and exports will rise, 
and the growth rate of consumption will stabilize together with personal income. 
The way the current account deficit is being financed is also important to underscore. Earlier 
episodes of balance of payments crises have typically been associated with high debt and 
liquidity and currency mismatches, which leave economies vulnerable to abrupt deterioration 
of  international  financial  conditions.  In  Chile,  the  present  current  account  deficit  is  being 
financed  mainly  by  FDI  flows,  associated  with  reinvested  earnings  and  new  investments, 
thus providing more strength to the capital account. 
Despite  these  factors,  we  need  to  remain  vigilant  because  an  economic  scenario  like  the 
present one can favor the incubation of future risks. Domestically, a scenario of very dynamic 
final sales and personal income, low unemployment and high utilization of installed capacity, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

can exacerbate the response of domestic demand and further expand the current account 
deficit. Abroad, the present abundance of international funding as a result of expansionary 
monetary policies in developed economies may facilitate the financing of the external deficit 
and push asset prices up, at the expense of incubating vulnerabilities for the future. 
All  this  means  that  we  must  be  particularly  alert  to  prevent  financial  vulnerabilities  from 
incubating,  since  these  situations  can  lead  to  higher  leverage  of  households,  firms  and 
financial  intermediaries,  as  well  as  currency  and  liquidity  mismatches.  In  this  regard,  one 
reassuring  element  is  that  in  recent  months  there  has  been  a  moderation  in  household 
indebtedness, which in any case has remained in line with the income trajectory. It is also 
important to continue to monitor the evolution of key financial prices and their interaction with 
lending. This is a task that is not confined only to the Central Bank, but is for all economic 
and financial policy makers. 
Beyond  these  risks,  in  the  scenario  we  consider  today  to  be  the  most  likely,  the  Chilean 
economy will expand at a pace that is consistent with its trends. Inflation will gradually return 
to 3% as specific temporary factors that have influenced recent indicators dissipate. Let me 
describe this scenario and the risks identified in some detail. 
Macroeconomic scenario 
Since  the  last  Monetary  Policy  Report,  the  Chilean  economy  has  continued  to  show  high 
strength and inflation has remained limited. Contractionary risks coming from abroad have 
eased, while expansionary risks originating domestically have gained importance. Domestic 
output and demand growth exceeded projections, with a greater boost from investment and 
more recently also from private consumption. Dynamic expenditure has resulted in a smaller 
trade surplus and a high degree of internal resource utilization. Headline and core inflation 
indicators have dropped to near 1% annually because of a number of temporary factors, and 
forecasts  are  that  they  will  return  to  3%  within  the  projection  horizon.  Internationally,  the 
threats  associated  with  the  situation  in  the  Eurozone  are  still  in  full  force,  but  other  risks, 
relating  to  the  U.S.  and  China,  have  moderated.  In  this  scenario,  the  Board  has  held  the 
Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 5%. 
As I mentioned at the beginning, Chile’s GDP grew 5.6% in 2012. The fourth-quarter figure 
was slightly higher than estimated in the previous Monetary Policy Report and expected by 
the  market,  largely  due  to  the  greater  contribution  of  mining.  In  the  last  six  quarters,  the 
expansion of sectors other than natural resources, that better reflect changes in the use of 
installed capacity, has continued showing relatively stable rates, around 5.5%, not far above 
the trend. 
Domestic demand growth, in contrast, has picked up again. After falling steadily during 2011 
and approaching GDP growth rates in early 2012, it rose again in the following quarters, to 
end the year with a y-o-y expansion that outperformed GDP by 1.5 percentage points. This 
reacceleration  reflects  stronger  investment  and,  most  recently,  also  stronger  private 
consumption. 
On the investment front, the strong momentum of mining and energy projects has persisted, 
while imports of capital goods have continued to reflect the strong increase in the purchases 
of  transport  equipment. Moreover,  in  the real  estate  industry,  sales  have  remained strong, 
particularly for housing in construction stage, and other indicators such as dispatches, sales 
and  imports  of  materials  for  this  sector  have  remained  high  despite  some  marginal 
slowdown. 
The expansion of consumption has found support in rising personal income, which reflects 
the evolution of employment and real wages. In the fourth quarter of 2012 consumption grew 
7.3% in real terms, owing primarily to durable goods. Partial data from the first quarter of this 
year,  such  as  retail,  household  items  and  car  sales,  signals  dynamic  private  consumption. 
Domestic financial conditions show no major changes in recent months. Importantly, unlike 
2 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
previous cycles, this time consumer loans have not been an important catalyst for personal 
spending,  since  such  loans  have  been  growing  at  a  slower  pace.  This  is  important 
information, because it reduces the probabilities of a strong deceleration or contraction in the 
near future due to households’ need to reduce their debt, a factor that has been behind the 
weakness of developed economies for years already (figure 2). 
The dynamism of domestic demand has manifested in increased imports, so its impact on 
the use of internal resources and inflation has been limited. The fastest-growing components 
of  expenditure,  namely  investment  in  machinery  &  equipment  and  durable  consumption, 
have been favored by the drop in relative import prices. The deficit of the current account of 
the  balance  of  payments  moved  from  1.3%  of GDP  in  2011  to  3.5%  in  2012,  slightly  less 
than  projected  last  December.  As  has  been  noted  before,  the  bigger  deficit  is  a  matter  of 
concern, but its risks are mitigated by the greater investment flows to the tradable sector – 
related  to  major  mining  projects  –  as  well  as  by  the  weight  of  FDI  flows  in  its  funding. 
Portfolio inflows and debt levels have remained at similar levels than previous years. 
Inflation has continued to follow a downward trend. In February, the annual change in CPI 
stood at 1.3% and core inflation – in its CPIEFE measure, which excludes food and energy – 
reached 0.8% annually (figure 3). The recent trend has reflected a number of specific and 
transient influences, such as the high basis for comparison of the same months of 2012, the 
appreciation  of  the  peso,  the  normalization  of  previous  shocks  to  the  prices  of  some 
perishables, and the stamp tax reduction. These effects have also been expressed through 
indexation  mechanisms  and  expectations,  and  in  the  moderate  services  inflation  rates 
despite  strong  demand  and  tight  domestic  markets.  Other  more  lasting  effects  cannot  be 
ruled out, such as the observed increase in productivity or the reduction in trade margins. In 
any case, the procyclical behavior of these elements leads to conclude that the medium-term 
inflationary  risks  associated  to  the  intensity  of  use  of  installed  capacity  are  still  present. 
However, it is worth noting that private expectations one and two years out remain anchored 
around 3%. 
Internationally,  the  outlook  of slow  growth  in  developed  economies  is  maintained,  but  with 
some improvements. In the U.S. there are signs that private spending is gaining momentum, 
but  growth  prospects  remain  bounded  because  of  the  need  for  further  fiscal  adjustments. 
The Eurozone is still in recession and its recovery is being held back by the need to advance 
towards fiscal consolidation, persistent problems in the financial systems and the difficulty in 
making  the  necessary  relative-price  adjustments  within  the  region.  Plus  the  political 
difficulties to implement reforms that would allow raising trend growth rates. The emerging 
world  continues  to  exhibit  higher  growth  rates,  although  its  performance  has  been  more 
mixed.  Fears  of  a  pronounced  slowdown  in  China  have  eased,  and  indicators  point  to  a 
stabilization of output. Other emerging Asian economies are also signaling an improvement. 
In Latin America, the strong growth of Peru contrasts with the deceleration in Colombia and 
slow  growth  in  Brazil  and  Argentina.  The  growth  rates  of  other  developed  economies  and 
commodity  exporters  have  been  affected  by  fiscal  processes  and  lower  prices  of  some  of 
their  exports,  simultaneously  with  high  current-account  deficits.  From  December,  the 
baseline  scenario  of  this  Report  corrects  the  growth  projection  for  our  trading  partners 
upward to an average of 3.9% in the forecast horizon, the first upward revision in over a year. 
Global financial conditions have improved in recent months, partly reflecting a perception of 
lower probability of occurrence of extreme scenarios, particularly in the U.S., after learning 
that  only  some  of  the  drastic  fiscal  adjustments  previously  approved  will  take  effect.  The 
greater  confidence  was  reflected  in  greater  preference  for  variable-income  assets  in 
developed economies, where long-term interest rates and stock prices have risen. The U.S. 
dollar has appreciated since December, mainly against the yen, reflecting expectations of a 
more expansionary monetary policy in Japan. Most of the currencies of emerging economies, 
including the Chilean peso, have appreciated against the dollar in the same time span.

The  gasoline  price  has  risen  substantially  this  year  so  far,  largely  because  of  supply-side 
factors. This results in an upward revision of its forecast for this year and next. The copper 
price  trend  is forecast to  slope  downward,  because  of  a  larger  response  of supply  than  in 
previous years, but it is revised up in 2013, incorporating actual first-quarter figures. Thus, 
the baseline scenario assumes that the terms of trade will be slightly higher than foreseen 
last December (table 1).  
In  the  baseline  scenario,  GDP  growth  will  be  in  the  4.5%–5.5%  range  in  2013,  exceeding 
December  projections.  The  revision  is  partly  explained  by  stronger  growth  foreseen  in  the 
mining  industry,  as  revealed  by  incoming  indicators.  It  also  considers  that  the  external 
impulse the Chilean economy will be receiving from abroad will be somewhat stronger, in line 
with upward revisions to growth of our trading partners and terms of trade. 
Domestic  demand  growth,  because  of  both  its  dynamism  of  the  end  of  2012  and  partial 
indicators  of  early  2013,  is  also  corrected  upward,  to  6.1%  (5.7%  in  December).  Annual 
growth  in  investment  and  consumption  is  up  from  earlier  projections,  bringing  the  current 
account deficit to 4.4% of GDP in 2013, compared with 4.6% forecast in December. In any 
case, the path of domestic demand and investment assumes variation rates declining in the 
coming quarters (table 2).  
Y-o-y inflation will remain low in the short term, still affected by the specific factors that have 
influenced recent indicators. As they dissipate, CPI inflation will start to rise, reaching 2% by 
mid-year. In early 2014, both headline and core CPI inflation should hit 3% and stay there 
until  the  end  of  the  projection  horizon,  this  time  the  first  quarter  of  2015  (figure  4).  This 
projection  assumes  that  wages  will  adjust  in  line  with  productivity  and  the  inflation  target. 
This forecast also uses as a methodological assumption that in the projection horizon, the 
real  exchange  rate  (RER)  will  remain  around  its  recent  values.  This,  because  with  the 
nominal exchange rate and currency parities currently in effect, the RER is estimated to be 
within – although in the lower part of – the range consistent with its long-term fundamentals. 
Finally, the baseline scenario uses as a working assumption that the MPR trajectory will be 
similar to what can be inferred from the latest surveys available at the statistical closing of 
this Report (figure 5). 
In the past few quarters, the Chilean peso has appreciated both bilaterally against the dollar 
and in multilateral terms (figure 6). This gain in value has also resulted in an appreciation of 
the RER. The factors behind this trend are varied, but in essence have to do with the cyclical 
position of the Chilean economy relative to other countries, especially the developed world, 
and  the  weight  of  commodities  in  its  export  basket.  However,  as  we  note  in  a  box  in  this 
Report, if these factors are taken into account, the appreciation of the Chilean RER  is not 
different  from  that  of  other  emerging  economies,  other  commodity-exporting  countries  and 
other  economies  with  closed  output  gaps  (figure  7). When  a  longer  period  is  used  for  the 
comparison (e.g. the last ten or fifteen years) the conclusions are the same. 
In  this  context,  some  economies  have  implemented foreign  exchange measures,  including 
interventions  to  mitigate  the  appreciation  of  their  currencies.  While  these  actions  may  be 
desirable in certain situations – Chile has actually used them in the past and they are part of 
its policy toolkit – implementing them requires a careful evaluation of both the benefits and 
costs to the country. These measures are appropriate to correct an over-reaction in the value 
of  the  currency  against  its  medium-  and  long-term  fundamentals  or  as  a  way  to  build  an 
international reserve position, providing greater safety in the event of a sharp contraction of 
external financing. These benefits are difficult to quantify objectively, but it is reasonable to 
think that the lower the availability of reserves or the further away the real exchange rate is 
from its long-term trend, the greater the benefits. 
At  the  same  time,  we  must  always  bear  the  costs  associated  with  these  interventions  in 
mind.  First,  there  is  the  direct  financial  cost,  because  the  reserves  are  invested  in  highly 
liquid  and  safe  instruments,  but  whose  interest  rates  are  lower  than  that  of  the  local 
instruments  financing  their  acquisition.  This  generates  a  significant  cost  that  eats  into  the 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
Central Bank’s net worth. Moreover, it is important to preserve the flexibility of the exchange 
rate  in  the  Chilean  economy  because  it  facilitates  accommodating  external  shocks.  The 
major  external  crises  we  have  faced  in  the  past  have  been  associated  with  overly  rigid 
exchange rate regimes, which exacerbate credit cycles and mismatches, delay relative-price 
adjustments  and  when  they  finally  occur,  they  have  high  financial  and  real  costs  for  the 
economy. 
As usual, our baseline scenario reflects those events that are believed to be the most likely 
with the information at hand at the closing of this Report. There are risk scenarios, however, 
which  if  materialized,  may  reshape  the  macroeconomic  environment  –  in  some  cases, 
significantly  –  and  therefore,  may  alter the  course  of  monetary  policy.  On  this  opportunity, 
having  evaluated  the  alternative  scenarios,  the  Board  estimates  that  the  risk  balance  is 
biased upward for output and unbiased for inflation. 
Internationally, the probability of negative scenarios in the United States have moderated in 
recent months and in China the threat of a sharp correction in growth has eased. However, 
the  possibility  of  tensions  intensifying  in  the  Eurozone  has  not  receded.  The  fiscal  and 
financial fragility in this region persists and the ability of policy makers to implement reforms 
is  weakened  due  to  meager  growth  prospects.  The  recent  episode  of  Cyprus  is  a  case  in 
point.  Italy  also  deserves  special  concern,  because  of  the  size  of  its  public  debt  and  its 
weight  in  the  European  banking  system.  New  stress  episodes  in  international  financial 
markets could lead to adjustments in the prices of financial assets and commodities, and in 
global  growth  prospects.  In  particular,  a  sharp  and  persistent  decline  in  copper  prices 
originating in real or financial factors would have significant effects on the current account, 
domestic demand and inflation. 
The emerging world is facing big challenges in the conduct of economic policies in a scenario 
that  foresees  that  the  strongly  expansionary  monetary  policy  of  developed  economies  will 
continue for a long period. This, because of the possible effects of interest rate differentials 
between emerging and developed countries on capital flows, asset prices, credit growth and 
currency  behavior.  Currency-related  tensions  may  create  frictions  that  may  hamper 
international trade and world growth. 
The greatest risks have to do with the persistence of highly dynamic domestic demand. On 
one hand, the economy is already using its internal resources intensively, so if the current 
expansion  of  domestic  expenditure  continues,  it  could  generate,  in  the  medium  term, 
additional pressures on the labor market, the use of installed capacity and inflation. On the 
other  hand,  because  of  its  incidence  in  the  behavior  of  the  current  account  deficit  and  its 
potential impact on the vulnerability of the Chilean economy. Any sudden change in external 
conditions, say, a reduction in the terms of trade or unfavorable financial conditions, could 
expose the country to costly adjustments. History provides several episodes of this nature. 
While  the  Chilean  economy  has  refined  its  economic  policy  framework  to  make  it  more 
resilient  to  external  shocks,  and  both  the  funding  of  the  current  account  deficit  and  the 
destination  of  its resources  mitigate  these  risks,  it  is  essential  to  prevent  the  incubation of 
imbalances.  
The opposing forces facing monetary policy remain. Some external risks have eased, but the 
European situation is delicate. Inflationary risks in the medium term remain in place due to 
strong demand. The MPR is within an estimated neutral range, but its current level is high by 
international standards. (figure 8). 
Interest  rate  differentials  with  the  developed  world  pose  challenges  for  policy  making  in 
emerging economies, including Chile. The Board follows closely the evolution of the external 
and  internal  macroeconomic  scenarios  and  their  impact  on  inflation,  and  reiterates  its 
commitment  to  conduct  monetary  policy  so  that  projected  inflation  stands  at  3%  over  the 
policy horizon.  
Allow me some final thoughts.

Final remarks 
The  Chilean  economy  has  made  great  progress  in  the  past  several  decades.  The 
improvements  to  our  economic  and  financial  policy  regimes,  together  with  an  external 
environment  that  has  been  relatively  favorable  for  our  country  –  particularly  the  price  of 
copper,  which  owes  in  turn  to  the  strength  of  the  Chinese  economy  –  permitted  us  to 
successfully weather the worst international crisis of the last sixty years. We healed quickly 
and today we are close to full employment, with personal income growing steadily and low 
inflation. Plus high investment levels that will help us sustain this growth trend into the future.  
Still, there are big challenges ahead. Risks are present and the policies we need to adopt to 
confront them are not always evident. So it is essential that we keep the road clear and take 
good care of that which has taken so much effort to achieve. Let me say again what I said at 
the beginning: self complacency is one of the worst mistakes the entities responsible for our 
country’s  economic  policies  can  make.  Thus  we  must  pay  close  attention  to  events.  As  a 
central bank our focus is on ensuring the stability of prices and the financial system. This is 
the best contribution we can make to the well-being of our population. 
Thank you.
