Fabio Panetta: Banks, finance, growth 
Remarks by Mr Fabio Panetta, Deputy Director General of the Bank of Italy, at a colloquium 
entitled  “Beyond  the  crisis:  What  lies  in  store  for  Italian  banks?”,  by  Associazione  per  lo 
Sviluppo  degli  Studi  di  Banca  e  Borsa  in  collaboration  with  Università  Cattolica  del  Sacro 
Cuore of Milan, Perugia, 23 March 2013. 
 The  Italian  economy  is  going  through  a  very  difficult  period,  in  which  structural 
weaknesses have been  compounded by adverse cyclical conditions. In the last five years, 
we have had to deal with the financial crisis, instability in the sovereign debt market and a 
severe double-dip recession. Since the start of the crisis, GDP has fallen by 7 per cent and 
600,000 jobs have been lost. 
Thanks  to  sound  initial  conditions,  the  Italian  banking  system  has  been  able  to 
withstand the succession of real and financial shocks, benefiting from prudent supervision, 
which has reassured international investors as to the quality of banks’ balance sheets and 
averted the destabilizing surge that has hit other European financial systems. 
Nonetheless, Italian banks could not avoid the indirect repercussions of the crisis: the 
recession  affected  loan  quality;  the  deterioration  of  sovereign  debt  ratings  dried  up  the 
sources  and  increased  the  cost  of  funding;  profitability  fell  dramatically.  This  affected  the 
supply of credit, which has tightened in recent months. The latest data, for January, indicate 
a twelve-month contraction in lending to firms of around 3 per cent. 
The  exceptional  measures  taken  by  the  Eurosystem  in  2011  and  2012  stopped  the 
liquidity  crisis  from  turning  into  a  credit  crunch,  with  ruinous  consequences  for  the  real 
economy. Tensions are now concentrated on loan quality: bad loans account for 6.9 per cent 
of  total  lending,  while  all  deteriorated  credit  amounts  to  12.8  per  cent  (3.3  per  cent  and 
8.4 per cent, respectively, net of value adjustments). The impact on earnings is substantial: 
in the three years 2009–11 write-downs and loan losses absorbed 60 per cent of operating 
profit on average. 
The economic cycle forces banks to take high lending risks, which must be covered by 
their reserve assets. The Bank of Italy is checking, including by means of on-site controls, 
the adequacy of the value adjustments made by a great number of large and medium-sized 
banking  groups  and,  where  necessary,  requiring  corrective  action.  The  preservation  of  a 
satisfactory  level  of  provisioning  allows  banks  to  maintain  investor  confidence  and  attract 
low-cost  external  funding.  This  is  essential  to  continue  to  guarantee  an  adequate  flow  of 
credit to households and firms. 
In order to avoid procyclical effects, in connection with this action the Bank of Italy has 
asked banks to increase internally-generated resources by cutting costs, selling non-strategic 
assets, and adopting dividend policies consistent with their individual income and balance-
sheet  position.  The  criteria  for  the  remuneration  of  directors  and  executives  must  also  be 
consistent  with  the  aim  of  capital  strengthening,  giving  a  clear  indication  of  company 
strategy. 
Beyond the short term, the recovery of banks’ profitability and the strengthening of their 
capacity to serve the real economy will require profound changes to their business model. In 
the following pages I will examine two topics of particular importance for the Italian banking 
system. 
The first  regards the  need  to  encourage firms to  access the  capital markets  directly. 
Conditions  are  now  favourable  for  both  banks  and  firms  to  work  for  this  objective  to  their 
profit.

The  second  regards  the  need  to  shift  more  decisively,  through  technology,  the 
traditional  distribution  channels  towards  more  advanced  systems,  achieving  a  substantial 
reduction in operating costs. 
 In  the  last  few  weeks  uncertainties  over  prospective  developments  in  the  Italian 
economy  have  resurfaced.  The  quite  moderate  recovery  forecast  for  late  this  year  is  now 
threatened  by  the  unpredictability  of  the  domestic  political  situation  and  the  resurgence  of 
financial turmoil in the euro area, which could undermine confidence and investment. 
In  order  to  preserve  the  prospective  recovery,  action  to  support  business  activity  is 
necessary. If taken promptly, the measures now under discussion for the payment of general 
government debts to suppliers will be of considerable help. 
However,  there  cannot  be  an  enduring  recovery  without  adequate  financial  support. 
Banks  are  called  on  to  make  an  essential  contribution:  to  continue  providing  the  credit 
needed  to  sustain  economic  activity;  to  accompany  firms  with  good  growth  prospects  in 
raising funds on the market; to serve, once more, as a focal point for revitalizing the Italian 
economy. 
The structure of the financial system and the financing of firms 
The Italian banking system is comparatively small with respect to the real economy. Its 
total  assets  amount  to  2.7  times  GDP,  significantly  less  than  in  the  other  major  countries 
except for the United States (Figure 1). Nevertheless, the banks play a pre-eminent role in 
the  financing  of  firms.  Bank  loans  made  up  over  two  thirds  of  Italian  firms’  financial  debt, 
compared with about a third in France, Britain and the United States and half in Germany. 
Italy is the only major country in which this share has increased since the onset of the crisis 
(Figure 2). 
By  contrast,  the  Italian  capital  market  plays  a  limited  role  in  financing  enterprises. 
Firms’ equity endowment in Italy is not unlike that in other countries. Financial leverage,1 at 
about 50 per cent, is broadly on a par with that of firms in Japan, Germany and the United 
Kingdom and higher than in the US and France. 
But about four fifths of shares are held and traded outside the official markets. Stock 
exchange listing is circumscribed to a few large firms. Considering non-financial corporations 
only,  in  2012  Italy  counted  230  listed  firms,  compared  with  about  700  in  France  and 
Germany. The median firm in Italy had a market capitalization of about €90 million, twice as 
much as in those two countries. The total market value of Italy’s non-financial corporations is 
less  than  20  per  cent  of  GDP,  compared  with  75  per  cent  in  France  and  45  per  cent  in 
Germany (Figure 3). 
Bond  financing  is  also  limited,  outstanding  issues  now  amounting  to  less  than 
8 per cent of firms’ total financial debt (Figure 4). Just a few Italian corporations make bond 
issues on the capital market (an average of ten a year over the past decade). Here, again, 
Italy lags significantly behind, and in recent years the gap has widened (Figure 5).2 The same 
pattern holds for other instruments of direct or indirect recourse to the market, such as asset 
securitizations. 
This  type  of  financial  system  –  bank-dependent,  lacking  well-developed  equity  and 
bond markets, incapable in practice of offering the productive economy any resources other

In  the  four  years  from  2009  through  2012  bond  issues  by  Italian  non-financial  corporate  groups  on  the 
international markets were negligible, while those by French and German groups were large and growing.

than bank credit – is especially disadvantageous in the present cyclical phase. It penalizes 
firms, especially the smaller ones, because it prevents them from coping with the tightening 
of credit supply by replacing bank loans with other instruments. And it penalizes banks as 
well, saddling them with very high costs and risks. What is more, the strains in credit supply 
aggravate the difficulties of firms and feed back onto the banks’ own balance sheets through 
heightened credit risk and defaults. 
The  scant  presence  of  Italian  firms  in  the  capital  markets  is  a  well-known  problem, 
rooted in the structural weaknesses of the economy. First of all, it reflects the response to the 
incentives of firms themselves. They are, in fact, reluctant to open themselves to outsiders. 
Expansion and access to the markets entail potentially significant transparency costs owing 
to  increased  visibility  (to  the  tax  authorities,  to  regulators,  to  minority  shareholders),  an 
excessive tax burden, a plethora of inefficiently applied rules and regulations, and the poor 
flexibility of the goods and labour markets.3 
One  consequence  of  the  small  average  size  of  Italian  firms  is  low  demand  for  such 
financial  services  as  listing  assistance,  securities  issues,  and  syndicated  loan  placement. 
These are services that are used heavily by large corporations but very little by small firms, 
which are inherently less transparent, have few shareholders and are generally not present 
in the capital markets. In the past, repeated efforts have been made to draw Italian firms to 
the stock market by reducing the cost of listing, offering tax breaks for listing or share issues, 
and  instituting  stock  exchange  segments  dedicated  to  small  and  innovative  businesses. 
Action has been taken to raise disclosure standards, enhance the liquidity of securities and 
improve the quality of governance. The results have been disappointing. 
At times, banks too have imagined that they could profit from the underdevelopment of 
the markets. Firms’ dependence on credit reduces their bargaining power, enabling banks to 
impose better terms for lending. The limited empirical evidence on this point suggests that 
listed  firms  and  firms  that  issue  bonds  on  capital  markets  pay  lower  interest  rates.  These 
findings apply also to large corporations, which are the least likely to be “captured” by their 
banks.4 
Growth of the markets: a possible change 
An  under-developed  capital  market  and  the  productive  system’s  reliance  on  bank 
lending have thus been the short-sighted response of Italian firms and banks to incentives. 
Accordingly, they have been a typical feature of our financial system. The financial crisis, the 
sovereign  debt  tensions,  and  the  economic  recession  are  changing  those  incentives, 
however, and may initiate a shift in the methods of financing Italian business. 
On  the  one  hand  banks  are  being  forced  to  reduce  the  overall  size  of  their  balance 
sheets  in  response  to  both  cyclical  and  structural  factors,  such  as  the  new  capital  and 
liquidity  regulations,  market  pressures  to  reduce  leverage,  the  high  cost  of  funding,  large 
credit  risk,  and  low  profitability.  The  credit  supply  tensions  that  have  arisen  on  several 
occasions in recent months are a reflection of these factors. On the other hand firms have 
seen  their  scope  for  self-financing  diminish  and  the  volume  of  overdue  payments  from 
general government sky-rocket. In such a situation, even healthy businesses need to be able 
to count on the availability of sufficient external sources of financing. 
                                                
3  M.  Pagano,  F.  Panetta  and  L.  Zingales,  “Why  Do  Companies  Go  Public?”  Journal  of  Finance,  LIII,  No. 1, 
1998, suggest that the relative underdevelopment of the Italian stock market depends on firms’ unwillingness 
to accept the obligations of transparency that listing entails. 
4  The impact of listing on the cost of credit is studied in Pagano, Panetta and Zingales, op. cit. The effect of 
bond market access on the interest rates on bank loans is studied in F. Panetta, 2001, “Le banche e i servizi 
finanziari  alle  imprese”,  address  to  the  conference  La  concorrenza  nell’offerta  di  servizi  finanziari:  mercati, 
banche e altri operatori, Associazione per gli studi di Banca e Borsa, SADIBA.

This dangerous stalemate – the combined effect of a reduced supply of credit and the 
productive  system’s  increased  dependence  on  external  finance  –  can  be  overcome  by 
enlarging direct recourse to the markets, with considerable benefits for firms and banks alike. 
In  the  present  phase  of  the  cycle,  the  benefits  for  firms  of  being  able  to  access 
otherwise unavailable funds outweigh the costs of disclosure. The advantages of diversified 
sources of funding, greater negotiating power in raising bank loans, and the reputational gain 
that  comes  with  access  to  the  markets  are  another  inducement  towards  openness  and 
transparency. 
Expanding  the  sources  of  funding  requires  a  major  commitment  by  businesses  to 
increase  the  transparency  of  their  financial  statements,  take  concrete  steps  to  open  up  to 
outside parties, and strengthen their capital base as a sign of confidence in the company’s 
soundness.  It  is  unrealistic  to  suppose  that  today’s  markets  would  be  willing  to  support 
opaque or under-capitalized projects. 
The  potential  benefits  are  considerable  for  banks  as  well.  To  begin,  chaperoning 
businesses  in  the  market  would  allow  banks  to  avoid  the  deterioration  in  credit  risks  that 
rationing  their  clientele  might  otherwise  entail  and  to  increase  income  from  business 
services,  which  remains  under-developed.  By  providing  the  consulting  services  that  are 
crucial for firms’ direct funding and that imply low capital and liquidity absorption, the banks 
could strengthen, not weaken, their relationships with firms, as well as their role in a more 
articulated financial system. 
For  greater  recourse  to  the  market  to  be  possible  banks  must  enter  into  long-term 
relationships  with  firms  and  improve  their  ability  to  evaluate  the  latter’s  economic  and 
financial prospects. The task is not an easy one, and in the past it was not carried out in full. 
Steps  must  be  taken  to  improve  staff  training  and  increase  their  ability  to  help  firms 
access the markets, and to prevent conflicts of interest within the banks stemming from their 
combined  role  in  granting  credit,  promoting  market  access  and  (directly  or  indirectly) 
managing  household  savings.  Fears  that  the  banking  system  plans  to  transfer  the  cost  of 
past  lending  errors  to  the  market  must  be  dispelled.  Even  the  riskiest  borrowers  can  be 
helped to access the market if potential financiers can rely on the transparency they need to 
make informed decisions. Unless these conditions are fulfilled, banks’ reputations and their 
clients’ confidence will be undermined. 
Banks  and  firms  are  not  the  only  ones  responsible  for  developing  the  Italian  capital 
market.  To  achieve  this  objective  the  whole  economic  and  financial  system  must  undergo 
changes  to  stimulate  long-term  investors  such  as  pension  funds,  provide  incentives  for 
investment  in  venture  capital,  and  eliminate  the  fiscal  and  administrative  constraints  that 
discourage firms from growing in size. 
Banks and firms have a crucial role to play, however. It is up to them to pave the way 
for change. 
Technology and banks’ distribution costs 
Italian  banks’  profitability  has  fallen  significantly  during  the  crisis.  Between  2006  and 
2011  their  annual  profit  declined  by  more  than  30  per  cent  as  a  result  of  a  steep  drop  in 
income  together  with  a  slight  rise  in  costs  (Figure  6).  The  deterioration  was  concentrated 
among  the  largest  groups,  which  saw  their  annual  profit  decline  by  46  per  cent  as  they 
recorded a reduction in operating costs (down by 9 per cent) but an even sharper contraction 
in  gross  income  (Figure  7).  The  other  banks  registered  a  slight  rise  in  profits  (up  by 
1.6 per cent), despite an increase of 17 per cent in costs. Profitability remained low in 2012 
as well.

The  current  levels  of  profitability  are  insufficient  to  remunerate  capital  adequately.  In 
the absence of incisive action, they threaten to weaken banks’ capitalization, their capacity to 
finance the recovery of the real economy. 
In  the  1990s  the  rebound  in  bank  profitability  came  about  principally  through  an 
expansion  of  income,  with  only  modest  interventions  on  costs  (Figure  8).5  In  the  present 
circumstances,  an  increase  in  revenues  appears  unlikely  considering  the  stagnation  in 
lending,  narrow  profit  margins,  the  downward  trend  of  asset  management  and  the 
penalization  of  trading  activity  implicit  in  the  new  capital  rules.  Overall,  the  Italian  banking 
system  seems  to  have  an  excess  of  capacity,  which  drives  down  the  overall  volume  of 
business.  In  the  short  term,  therefore,  raising  profitability  requires  energetic  action  on  the 
cost side, with an unflinching review of the combination of production factors and distribution 
channels. 
While the demand for banking services has grown slowly in the last twenty years, the 
number of bank branches has nearly doubled. Gauged against the euro-area average, it is 
excessive  in  relation  both  to  total  bank  assets  (€111  million  per  branch  in  Italy  against 
€170 million in the euro area) and to the volume of loans (€59 million against €67 million).6 
Until  the  start  of  the  financial  crisis,  the  increase  in  the  number  of  branches  went 
together  with  an  expansion  of  virtual  distribution  channels  (Figure  9),  rapidly  growing 
investment in information and communication technology (ICT) (Figure 10) and stable staff 
size.  The  crisis  has  only  attenuated  these  trends.  The  use  of  technology  and  remote 
distribution  has  thus  largely  overlapped,  not  replaced,  the  utilization  of  labour  and  the 
traditional branch network. The cost-income ratio has not come down; on the contrary, up to 
2011 it increased. 
Massive  recourse  to  ICT  can  reverse  these  trends  through  synergistic  use  of  the 
different  distribution  channels  (branches,  telephone,  call  centres,  ATMs  and  the  Internet), 
according  to  the  practices  followed  by  the  intermediaries  that  have  become  international 
success stories. 
Remote  channels  can  be  used  for  the  distribution  of  highly  standardized,  low-value-
added  transaction-based  services,  such  as  liquidity  management  and  consumer  finance 
products,  especially  to  the  more  technologically  or  financially  advanced  customers.  This 
would permit the drastic pruning of the traditional distribution network and would free up the 
resources  needed  to  strengthen  the  remaining  branches,  focusing  their  activity  on  more 
complex  or  advisory-intensive  products,  such  as  corporate  banking,  mortgage  lending  and 
wealth  management,  that  can  generate  more  value  added  and  reinforce  customers’ 
preference  for  one-stop  shopping.  Recent  analyses  suggest  that  the  result  could  be  a 
reduction in costs of as much as 30 per cent in the medium term.7 
A  transformation  along  these  lines  is  no  easy  task.  It  will  require  changes  to  banks’ 
organization  and  operating  arrangements  in  order  to  acquire  the  necessary  technological 
knowledge,  ensure  integration  among  the  different  distribution  channels  and  train  staff  to 
perform new tasks. 
The  business  plans  of  the  main  listed  banking  groups  do  not  always  appear  to  be 
consistent with the above-mentioned objectives. In a number of cases, efficiency gains and 
productivity  increments  are  based  on  restructuring  of  the territorial  network  and  containing 
the number of staff, without envisaging progress towards multi-channel distribution. For the

few groups that publish complete information on the subject, investment in ICT is limited in 
amount  and  allocated  mainly  to  optimizing  existing  information  systems  rather  than 
developing  virtual  channels.  In  many  cases  the  resources  devoted  to  staff  training  are 
modest as well. 
Large-scale use of remote channels requires, above all, full confidence on the part of 
customers.  Its  absence  precludes,  for  example,  the  distance  marketing  of  high-unit-value 
products  such  as  mortgages  and  retirement  savings  products.  In  recent  years  significant 
efforts have been made to improve the quality and transparency of communications between 
banks and customers. The Bank of Italy has laid down rigorous rules, checking compliance in 
part through inspections at bank branches. Progress has been made, no doubt, but there is 
still considerable room for improvement, not only in the process of compliance with the large 
and  diversified  body  of  rules  but  also  in  actually  partaking  of  the  spirit  that  animates  the 
regulations on transparency and correct conduct. 
Going forward 
Greater recourse to the market by firms and cost cutting are in banks’ interest; they are 
essential  for  the  financing  of  the  real  economy.  However,  they  are  not  the  only  measures 
needed  to  adapt  intermediaries’  business  model  to  the  changes  brought  about  by  the 
financial crisis. 
Looking ahead, we must ask what will be the impact of the radical changes that have 
occurred  in  the regulatory  framework,  the financial  system  and  the  behaviour  of  investors. 
The  events  of  recent  years  have  clearly  (though  sometimes  tardily)  revealed  the  elusive 
nature of economies of scale and scope in banking,8 giving renewed impetus to the debate 
on  the  optimal  size  of  intermediaries  and  the  range  of  activities  that  can  be  performed 
simultaneously by any one banking group. 
The  rules  adopted  or  under  discussion  in  the  main  countries,  designed  to  separate 
traditional credit business from investment banking,9 are likely to lead to a radical change in 
the  operating  structure  of  the  largest  groups.  Their  application  deserves  to  be  carefully 
assessed. 
Faced with growing recourse to the markets and globalization, it will be necessary to 
find innovative ways to establish lasting credit relationships with customers, to follow firms in 
their international expansion and support their success in outlet markets, and to strengthen 
the supply of products and services to households at conditions that are advantageous for 
both savers and banks in an environment of low interest rates. 
To  provide  answers  to  these  and  other  questions,  it  is  essential  that  there  be  a 
continuous exchange between authorities, practitioners and scholars to compare theoretical 
precepts and institutional knowledge with experience in the field. It is to be hoped that this 
meeting will make a significant contribution to this search for understanding.
