Report 
Presentation  by  Mr  Rodrigo  Vergara,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  before  the 
Finance  Commission  of  the  Honorable  Senate  of  the  Republic,  Santiago  de  Chile,  1  July 
2013.

Introduction 
Mr.  President  of  the  Senate’s  Finance  Commission,  Senator  Andrés  Zaldívar,  senators 
members of this Commission, ladies and gentlemen, 
I  appreciate  your  invitation  to  present  our  Board’s  vision  on  recent  macroeconomic  and 
financial  developments,  their  prospects  and  implications  for  monetary  and  financial  policy. 
This  vision  is  contained  in  detail  in  our  Monetary  Policy  Report  of  June  2013  and  our 
Financial Stability Report of the first half of 2013. 
The  macroeconomic  scenario  facing  the  Chilean  economy  has  undergone  significant 
changes in recent months. Output and demand decelerated and, although some moderation 
in  their  growth  rates  was  expected  and  desirable,  the  first  quarter  brought  a  sharper 
adjustment  than  had  been  anticipated.  On  the  external  front,  there  have  been  significant 
developments in the composition of global growth, the trajectory of commodity prices and the 
evolution of global financial markets. 
From a medium-term perspective, recent developments point to a healthy normalization of 
the unusual international conditions that have prevailed for some years now, and their effects 
on  our  local  economy.  In  the  short  term,  however,  these  adjustments  can  lead  to  greater 
volatility in the real economy and financial markets as investment portfolios are adjusted to 
new conditions and spending plans are reviewed. I can responsibly say that our economy is 
well  prepared  to  accommodate  these  changes  in  the  international  arena,  emphasizing  the 
contribution of our inflation targeting with floating exchange rate scheme, the strength of the 
fiscal accounts and the financial system as well as our sound external financing structure. All 
these elements allow us to be reasonably confident in dealing with the ups and downs of the 
external environment and mitigating its impact on the Chilean economy and the welfare of 
our population. 
In the first quarter of 2013, output increased 4.1 percent annually, 1.6 percentage points less 
than it did in late 2012. On the expenditure side, the slowdown of investment stood out. Part 
of  this  adjustment  was  expected,  considering  that  a  number  of  wide-ranging  mining  and 
energy projects are entering their final phase. There are also transitory elements relating to 
one-time imports of capital goods that are more volatile. Another portion of the adjustment 
has to do with our external scenario, where the world economy is expected to slow down, 
manufacturing industries are decelerating across the board and where, moreover, the copper 
price has fallen around 20 percent from the $4 per pound it averaged in 2011. These factors 
have introduced greater caution in assessing new investments, so some of them have been 
postponed  pending  further  clarity  in  the  international  scene.  In  any  case,  this  investment 
slowdown is expected to continue, but not as intensely as in the first quarter (figure 1). 
As I was saying, there has also been important news on the external front, notably a major 
increase  in  the  volatility  of  the  world  financial  markets  in  the  last  month.  These  tensions 
originate in two forces. First, the consolidation of the recovery of output and employment in 
the  United  States  and  the  Federal  Reserve  has  indicated  that,  if  the  recovery  continues, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

during  the  second  half  of  the  year  it  will  begin  to  gradually  withdraw  the  extraordinary 
monetary stimuli now in effect. As there is no comparable precedent regarding these policies, 
these signals have shaken international financial markets in recent weeks, because of the 
implications that such withdrawal could have. 
Second,  the  Chinese  economy  has  slowed  down  beyond  expectations  and  apparently  the 
Chinese authorities would be more than willing to accept lower growth rates in an effort to 
safeguard the stability of its financial system and achieve a better balanced growth structure. 
This situation creates volatility because of China’s major contribution to world growth and its 
enormous weight in the commodity markets. The deceleration of emerging economies has 
been  widespread,  some  of  them  affected  by  slower  growth  in  China  and  others  by  the 
maturation of its expansion cycle, after several years of rapid economic growth. 
These  two  forces  have  created  uncertainty  and  triggered  a  readjustment  of  portfolios  to 
accommodate falling prices of financial assets and commodities, higher risk premiums and a 
generalized depreciation of emerging market currencies against the dollar. Overall, all these 
factors  combined  may  have  exacerbated  the  process  of  market  adjustments,  making  it 
difficult to distinguish whether these are temporary or permanent in nature (figure 2). 
Although the aforesaid adjustments in the world are good news in the sense that they signal 
a transition towards a more balanced configuration of the global economy, for this year and 
next  a  less  favorable  international  scenario  for  the  Chilean  economy  is  being  configured. 
Accordingly,  our  growth  projections  for  our  trading  partners  are  revised  downwards,  with 
higher credit costs and lower terms of trade than previously expected. The baseline scenario 
incorporates prices of $3.25 and $3.05 per pound for 2013 and 2014, respectively. This is 
quite  lower  than  what  we  anticipated  just  a  few  months  ago,  when  we  projected  prices  of 
$3.5 and $3.4 per pound for those years. These elements add to the normalization that is 
being  observed  in  domestic  demand.  Our  economy  is  on  a  good  standing  to  face  the 
transition to this new configuration of the external scenario. The recent depreciation of the 
real exchange rate facilitates the adjustment of the Chilean economy, and monetary policy is 
available to make adjustments if required. 
We have often referred to the benefits of having a floating exchange rate regime in an open 
economy  like  Chile,  which  is  regularly  subject  to  shocks  in  its  terms  of  trade  and  external 
financing. Preserving the float during good times provides exchange rate flexibility to address 
situations like the present one and thus promote a more efficient adjustment of the economy. 
It also plays a key role in preventing currency mismatches that have been so costly in other 
countries  in  the  region  and  in  Chile  in  the  past.  Thus,  the  period  of  favorable  financial 
conditions that we have seen in recent years has not resulted in higher short-term debt or 
currency mismatches in the banking system or in the non-financial sector. 
The  credibility  of  the  inflation  target  of  the  central  bank  is  another  important  asset,  which 
provides  room  for  monetary  policy  action,  as  are  compliance  with  the  fiscal  rule  and  the 
soundness of our banking system, which is  well-regulated and supervised. Free trade and 
diversified target markets for our exports also play a key role in ensuring that the transition to 
the new macroeconomic configuration is smooth. One example of its usefulness is the way in 
which non-mining exporters have managed to avoid the appreciation of the local currency in 
recent years and weather the international crisis. Despite the difficulties they have faced in 
some markets such as Europe and the United States, they have been able to retain global 
leadership positions, maintaining or increasing their shares in world trade. 
Some  of  the  adjustments  are  already  taking  place.  The  nominal  exchange  rate  has 
depreciated  more  than  6  percent  since  the  closing  of  the  March  Monetary  Policy  Report, 
while the real exchange rate has done so by 5.5 percent and domestic demand has begun to 
slow.  These  movements  go  in  the  direction  of  reducing  the  trend  current  account  deficit, 
which excludes the fluctuations in the terms of trade, which is a worrying factor as we have 
said throughout the last year.

Let me now turn to our baseline scenario for the Chilean economy and the main risks we 
have identified in our two Reports. 
Macroeconomic scenario 
In  Chile,  in  the  first  quarter  of  2013  the  q-o-q  seasonally-adjusted  annual  rate  of  GDP 
dropped  to  2.1  percent  from  7.7  percent  in  the  last  quarter  of  2012.  This  slowdown  was 
particularly  visible  in  the  sectors  linked  to  domestic  demand,  which  was  partly  offset  by  a 
better performance of natural resources. As I noted a moment ago, spending was primarily 
driven  by  investment.  Partial  second-quarter  indicators  suggest  that  the  deceleration  will 
continue, but with less intensity than in the first. Imports of capital goods remained at their 
lowest level of the first quarter. Existing home sales have moderated their growth rates, but 
other sectoral indicators are less conclusive. 
In this context of economic deceleration, banks’ commercial loans have reduced their annual 
variation rate significantly. This reflects slower growth in investment, but also a process of 
substitution of corporate financing sources. Total corporate debt has remained stable as a 
percentage  of  GDP.  In  the  domestic  market,  the  corporate  bond  placement  has  remained 
high and many companies took advantage of the favorable global conditions and resorted to 
external  financing  via  bonds.  In  addition,  stock  issuance  increased  and  there  was  a 
substantial inflow of foreign direct investment, including capital and credit. 
Dynamic  consumption  continues  to  rely  on  favorable  labor  market  conditions,  with  near 
record-low employment rates and personal income growing strongly. Consumer confidence, 
despite receding recently, is still on the optimistic side while the household debt to income 
ratio  is  stable.  However,  there  are  significant  changes  in  composition,  with  banking  debt 
overriding other credit suppliers. The available data suggests that such dynamism might be 
concentrating in middle- to upper-income households. And I say “suggests”, because neither 
us nor the industry supervisors have the whole picture of overall household borrowing. In a 
dynamic financial system, with many important non-bank lenders such as ours, we cannot 
afford to go on without a consolidated registry of debtors. Thus, I would like to reiterate, as 
has  the  Financial  Stability  Board  (FSB),  that  it  is  crucial  to  push  forward  the  bill  that  will 
improve the current system for sharing credit information. 
Both  headline  inflation and  its  core  indicator  CPIEFE,  that  is,  the  CPI  excluding  foodstuffs 
and energy, have remained near 1 percent annually. While there were no big surprises for 
the  CPIEFE  regarding  expectations  in  March,  headline  inflation  figures  were  below 
projections, affected by some temporary factors which are expected to reverse in the coming 
months. On one hand, the decline in international fuel prices, along with an appreciation of 
the peso in the first four months of the year, reflected in lower energy inflation. The recent 
depreciation  of  the  peso  will  help  to  reverse  this  situation  soon.  Electric  power  has  also 
helped  to  keep  inflation  low,  but  this  effect  is  reversible  once  the  impact  of  refunds 
implemented in April and May fades away and the forthcoming entry into force of new price 
regulation. In addition, the low basis for comparison of June 2012 will mean that CPI inflation 
will enter the tolerance range in the coming months. 
With  respect  to  the  CPI  measurement,  and  as  I  pointed  out  on  when  I  presented  the  last 
Monetary Policy Report to this Commission, I want to reiterate that the measurement of this 
index and other statistics, poses many methodological and practical challenges that must be 
dealt  with  in  a  continuous  and  transparent  fashion.  The  improvements  announced  by  the 
National Statistics Institute to the measurement methodology of certain specific products in 
the basket, as well as other improvements to be made on the occasion of the regular review 
of  the  household  basket,  are  most  welcome.  At  the  same  time,  I  take  this  opportunity  to 
reiterate that the incidence of the specific products in question on the final result of inflation is 
minor  and  does  not  alter  the  inflation  outlook  presented  on  this  occasion  or  that  we  have 
presented in the past (figure 3).

The  world  economy  has  begun  moving  towards  a  more  balanced  configuration  in  many 
dimensions,  including  a  narrowing  of  the  growth  gap  between  developed  and  emerging 
economies, the normalization of financial conditions and the prices of commodities. 
On the output side, the slowdown of emerging economies, partly offset by stronger growth of 
some  developed  ones,  results  in  a  downward  revision  to  Chile’s  main  trading  partners’ 
growth  forecast  by  two  and  five  tenths  of  one  point  in  2013  and  2014,  respectively,  as 
compared with our March Monetary Policy Report (table 1). 
In the developed world, the performance of the United States stands out. Its upturn has been 
accompanied  by  growing  private  consumption  and  a  gradual  recovery  of  real  estate,  with 
positive  numbers  from  the  labor  market,  credit  growth  and  consumer  confidence.  Plus  the 
momentum  of  investment  in  the  energy  sector  that  are  pulling  costs  down.  The  Japanese 
economy grew strongly in the first quarter of the year and short-term prospects have risen in 
response to the current policies of fiscal and monetary stimulus, but the sustainability of this 
improvement is yet to be seen. 
The outlook for the Eurozone continues to point to a contraction this year. The weakness of 
the peripheral economies has propagated inwards, which along with the fragility of the fiscal 
accounts  and  the  banking  systems  creates  a  vicious  circle  difficult  to  break.  Emerging 
economies are decelerating across the board, most notably China. The Chinese authorities 
have shown greater tolerance for lower growth rates, in an effort to achieve a more balanced 
demand structure and address some imbalances in the financial system. 
Meanwhile,  the  change  in  world  growth  composition,  along  with  expectations  of  an  early 
withdrawal  of  the  monetary  stimulus  in  the  U.S.  has  led  to  a  realignment  of  investment 
portfolios. Thus, long-term interest rates rose across the board, stock markets fell and risk 
premiums  increased.  The  effects  were  more  pronounced  in  emerging  economies,  whose 
currencies, including the Chilean peso, have depreciated. This has been accompanied by a 
decline in the prices of commodities, including copper. For Chile, the terms of trade are less 
favorable  than  they  were  in  March,  and  are  expected  to  remain  so  over  the  projection 
horizon. 
Thus,  a  new  scenario  has  been  created  where  the  very  favorable  conditions  for  emerging 
economies  in  terms  of  growth,  commodity  prices  and  financing  conditions  have  started  to 
normalize. Although some of the reasons behind these movements are positive, since they 
reflect  better  growth  expectations  particularly  for  the  United  States,  they  have  triggered 
market volatility that may unsettle those economies with more vulnerable financial or fiscal 
positions. 
In the baseline scenario, Chile’s GDP will grow between 4 and 5 percent in 2013, less than 
expected in March. This reflects the deceleration of the first quarter and the prospect of a 
smoother  trajectory  of  sectors  other  than  natural  resources  in  the  remainder  of  the  year, 
partially offset by higher growth in mining. Partial second-quarter indicators show an ongoing 
deceleration of investment, but milder than earlier in the year. Private consumption, although 
receding  somewhat,  continues  to  show  robust  fundamentals  related  to  labor  market 
conditions  and  strong  real  wages,  which  should  normalize  as  economic  activity  slows. 
Despite the slower growth of domestic demand, a lower copper price will result in a wider 
current account deficit this year, at 4.7 percent of GDP (table 2). 
Annual inflation is expected to return to the tolerance range once some transitory elements 
are reversed, hitting 3 percent during 2014. At the end of the projection horizon, this time the 
second quarter of 2015, it should stand at 3 percent. Core inflation will take somewhat longer 
to converge to 3 percent (figure 4). 
This forecast assumes that nominal wages will be adjusted in line with productivity and the 
inflation target. It also uses as a methodological assumption that in the projection horizon, 
the real exchange rate (RER) will remain fairly stable. This is based on the estimation that 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches
with the nominal exchange rate and currency parities in force today, the RER is in the range 
consistent with its long-term fundamentals (figure 5). 
Finally, the baseline scenario uses as a working assumption that, in the short term, the MPR 
trend  will  be  aligned  with  market  expectations.  As  I  have  said  time  and  again,  this  is  a 
working assumption and in no way must it be taken as a commitment on our part. We at the 
Board assess the course of monetary policy every month considering every incoming piece 
of information (figure 6). 
The baseline scenario reflects those events that are believed to be the most likely with the 
information at hand at the closing of this Monetary Policy Report. There are risk scenarios, 
however,  which  if  materialized,  may  reshape  the  macroeconomic  environment  and, 
therefore, may alter the course of monetary policy. On this opportunity, having evaluated the 
alternative scenarios, the Board estimates that the risk balance is unbiased for both output 
and inflation. 
Internationally,  there  is  the  possibility  of  a  sharper  slowdown  in  the  emerging  world, 
especially  motivated  by  a  deceleration  in  China.  In  addition  to  its  effects  on  our  trading 
partners’  growth,  such  a  scenario  is  worrisome  because  of  its  potential  impact  on  copper 
prices,  our  current  account  and  our  external  financing  needs.  Scenarios  of  this  type,  with 
significant exchange rate depreciations, may induce inflationary pressures in the short term, 
especially if combined with a persistently tight labor market and increasing real wages. 
Complex political and financial conditions persist in the Eurozone, so recurrent episodes of 
increased volatility are part of the baseline scenario. However, we cannot rule out that more 
serious events can occur with more severe and longer-lasting effects on global markets, in 
light  of  their  renewed  political  difficulties  to  implement  fundamental  structural  reforms,  and 
where the banking sectors are still dealing with deteriorating portfolios due to slow economic 
activity. 
Another risk coming from abroad has to do with how the conventional and unconventional 
measures of monetary stimulus will ultimately be withdrawn in the United States. Having no 
history in this creates uncertainty in the markets, mainly about the financial effects it might 
have. There may be an overreaction of the markets, with increased stress and sharp rises in 
long-term interest rates. The rising cost of financing this would entail for emerging markets 
and some Eurozone economies more dependent on external financing, would pose important 
policy challenges for them. In Chile, this could lead to increases in both the cost of external 
financing  of  companies  and  banks  and  higher  long-term  interest  rates  domestically.  As 
emphasized in our Financial Stability Report, it is important for banks in this context to keep 
the exposure of their balance sheets at bay. 
In any case, the U.S. monetary authorities have argued that if confronted with an unwanted 
reaction the process could be delayed or even reversed to some extent, so it is possible for 
the  effects  of  the  withdrawal  to  be  fairly  limited.  Moreover,  these  measures  should  be 
adopted  in  line  with  a  recovering  U.S.  economy  and  ongoing  financial  stability,  so  this 
scenario  is  not  necessarily  detrimental  to  the  emerging  economies,  but  rather  could  be  a 
normalization from the extraordinary conditions prevailing in the advanced economies over 
the last five years. If confirmed, this normalization would reduce concerns about an excess 
supply of foreign capital that have been emphasized in several Financial Stability Reports. 
These concerns relate to excessive borrowing by companies and banks abroad and asset 
price misalignments. 
Domestically,  a  sharper  deceleration  of  expenditure,  and  particularly  investment,  is  a 
possibility. This would entail, with some lag, an also sharper or faster slowdown of the other 
components  of  expenditure,  triggering  inflationary  pressures  and  affecting  the  course  of 
monetary policy. 
Lately  there  has  been  an  increase  in  provisions  for  consumer  credit,  coinciding  with  a 
deterioration  of  the  payment  behavior  of  this  segment,  somewhat  worse  than  could  be 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

expected given the economic cycle. Although the banking system’s capitalization levels are 
above  the  regulatory  minimums  and  the  stress  tests  we  present  in  the  Financial  Stability 
Report  indicate  that  they  are  sufficient  to  deal  with  a  severe  shock  to  growth  and  lending 
conditions, it is essential to closely monitor the evolution of these indicators and any factors 
that  may  affect  them.  In  this  sense,  it  is  important  to  avoid  any  measures  that  might 
encourage non-payment. 
The increase in the current account deficit of the balance of payments has been cause for 
concern  in  the  latest  Reports.  As  has  been  noted,  this  deficit  is  largely  explained  by  FDI-
financed investment flows into the tradable sector (i.e. mining). In recent months some of the 
necessary adjustments have begun to take place to correct this situation: the real exchange 
rate has depreciated and domestic demand has slowed. This will help to reduce the current 
account deficit in the medium term, beyond the transitory effects of fluctuations in the terms 
of trade. Still, this risk becomes even more significant if the copper price falls further, external 
financial conditions worsen and domestic demand remains strong. 
Our previous Financial Stability Report identified as a risk factor the performance of the real 
estate sector. Incoming data points to a moderation of some of the trends reviewed at the 
time. However, factors remain that call for careful monitoring by financial intermediaries and 
relevant policy makers. No acceleration has been observed in mortgage lending, against our 
worries in the last Report, while residential home sales have slowed, banks have been more 
cautious  in  lending  to  companies  in  the  industry  and  the  leverage  of  real  estate  firms  has 
stabilized. 
Despite these developments, housing sales are still fairly high and aggregate price indexes 
maintain their pace of expansion in a context where the standards of mortgage lending have 
not changed much. Keep in mind that the main factors that have pushed these aggregate 
prices  up  (i.e.  household  income  and  long-term  interest  rates)  have  been  exceptionally 
favorable  in  the  past  few  quarters.  Meanwhile,  the  profits  of  small  and  medium-sized 
construction enterprises have deteriorated, which could result in an increase in the sector’s 
payment  delays.  Finally,  the  outlook  for  the  supply  of  new  office  space  remains  high  by 
historical standards. 
The  Chilean  economy  is  well  positioned  to  deal  with  the  changing  internal  and  external 
conditions ahead. Internationally, conditions facing the Chilean economy have been benign 
for a long time, with high terms of trade and very favorable external financing conditions. At 
home, the progression of the investment cycle has led to strong growth in employment and 
spending  in  a  context  of  contained  inflation  and  neutral  ranges  for  the  MPR.  Indicators  of 
recent months suggest that external and internal conditions have started to normalize. The 
adjustments  in  relative  prices,  such  as  the  real  exchange  rate,  have  gone  in  the  right 
direction  to  help  the  economy  to  accommodate  the  new  situation,  that  is,  lower  terms  of 
trade,  and  the  normalization  of  domestic  demand  and  external  financing  conditions.  The 
Board  follows  the  evolution  of  external  and  domestic  macroeconomic  conditions  and  their 
implications on inflation closely, and reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy so 
that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. 
Let me finish with some reflections. 
Final reflections 
The economic conjuncture always presents challenges to those of us who are in charge of 
economic policy making. Now we must face a different configuration than what we’ve seen in 
recent years. The challenge will be to lead our economy on the path that will allow it to adjust 
at the lowest possible cost. The improvements we have made to our scheme of economic 
and financial policies in the past several decades are a precious asset for the task. 
Certainly our current position is very good compared with that of other emerging economies. 
Not every country took advantage of the great external conditions we faced in recent years 
6 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches
and some may have allowed the creation of vulnerabilities, which will become more clearly 
evident when facing the changes that are approaching. 
We all wish dynamic, sustainable development for the Chilean economy, in order to enhance 
the country’s welfare. Our contribution as a Central Bank is to keep inflation low and stable. 
Also,  to  contribute,  from  our  policy  maker’s  position,  to  identify  and  address  the  risks  that 
may affect the normal functioning of the financial system. 
Thank you.
