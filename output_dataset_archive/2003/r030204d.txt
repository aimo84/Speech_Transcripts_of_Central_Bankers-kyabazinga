 Lars Nyberg: The Swedish card payment market - current challenges and 
future developments  
Speech by Mr Lars Nyberg, Deputy Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, at Scandinavian Card Markets, 
Stockholm, on 3 February 2003. 
 To begin with, I would like to thank you for the invitation to participate in this conference. Given the 
short  time  at  my  disposal,  I  will  confine  myself  to  discussing  a  few  of  the  salient  features  of  the 
evolution of the card payment market in Sweden, identifying also the forces that appear to have driven 
this  evolution.  Judging  from  the  latest  innovations  in  this  area,  I  will  touch  upon  possible  future 
developments. Lastly, in my capacity as central banker, I will talk about some relevant policy issues. 
The evolution of the card payment market in Sweden 
Let me start by making a few observations concerning the market development in Sweden. 
1. 
Card payments have grown rapidly, but the use of cards is still far behind that of the other 
Nordic countries (fig.1). Between 1990 and 1997, the number of card payments per capita in 
Sweden  grew  at  a  steady  pace,  picking  up  speed  quickly  at  the  end  of  the  decade.  Still, 
when  the  new  millennium  started,  the  number  was  no  more  than  half  of  what  can  be 
observed  in  the  other  Nordic  countries.  This  is  somewhat  surprising,  considering  that 
payments systems and payment patterns are otherwise quite similar in these countries. We 
have no convincing answer to why Swedish consumers are less willing to use card payments 
than are their Nordic neighbours. One possible explanation is that card payments are, or are 
just  considered  to  be,  more  costly,  more  complicated  or  more  risky,  in  Sweden  than 
elsewhere, by consumers or by terminal keepers. I will come back to this issue later. 
Swedish consumers use debit cards rather than credit cards (fig. 2). Concerning preferences 
between debit and credit cards, clearly, Swedish card users favour debit cards, both in terms 
of value and volumes of transaction. In the year 2001, the number of debit card transactions 
amounted  to  just  above  80  per  cent  of  the  total.  Charge  cards  dominate  the  remaining 
20 per cent.  Credit  cards  with  revolving  credit  arrangements  do  not  seem  to  appeal  to 
Swedes.  In  this  respect,  Swedish  consumers'  preferences  are  in  line  with  those  of 
consumers  in  the  other  Nordic  countries  and  with  those  of  continental  Europeans.  On  the 
other  hand,  consumers  in  Anglo-Saxon  countries  seem  to  demand  pure  credit  cards  to  a 
larger extent. Cultural factors may account for the different preferences between credit and 
debit  card  products.  At  least  in  Sweden,  consuming  out  of  credit  is  still  considered  to  be 
somewhat irresponsible. In the old days of bank regulation, banks were not supposed to give 
credit for consumption purposes since available credit recourses should be channelled into 
productive investments. 
The  use  of  checks  is  negligible  (fig.  3).  Cards  have  increased  their  share  of  non-cash 
payments from less than ten per cent in 1990 to nearly 30 per cent today. The increase is 
partly reflected in a corresponding decrease in the share of check payments. In fact, checks 
have virtually disappeared from the Swedish payment market. However, the rapid decrease 
in the use of checks can not explain the growth of the card payment market. The share of 
checks  has  never  been  large  in  Sweden,  since  giro  payments  have  always  comprised  a 
large share of non-cash payments. 
Cash  is  still  the  king  (fig.  4).  Given  the  rapid  increase  in  the  use  of  cards  in  Sweden, 
particularly in the late 1990's, cash should have been expected to fall in importance. This, 
however, does not seem to have happened. The use of cash, measured as the ratio of the 
value  of  currency  in  circulation  (M0)  and  GDP,  fell  during  the  first  half  of  the  decade,  but 
have been fairly constant since then, lately even increasing somewhat. In the other Nordic 
countries the ratio of currency to GDP has been fairly stable, with the exception of Norway, 
where it has been falling. Furthermore, the level of cash to GDP is considerably lower in the 
other Nordic countries, perhaps reflecting their more widespread use of cards. In a longer 
perspective, starting 1950, the use of cash in relation to GDP has been falling considerably 
also in Sweden, from 10 down to four percentage points (fig.5).

Cash cards have not been successful (fig. 6). Chip cards with e-money function may be used 
in transactions of low value and for acceptance at smaller points of sale. This, however, is 
the part of the market where cash is most appreciated. The national roll out of the so-called 
Cash card occurred in Sweden in the latter part of the 1990s. Three of the four largest banks 
in Sweden, that together comprise the lion share of the card payment market, stand behind a 
common technology. The introduction has not been a success. Up to now, the growth in the 
use of the new product has been very modest and recently even negative in terms of number 
of  transactions.  However,  the  development  of  card  based  e-money  is  still  in  a  very 
embryonic  stage  of  development.  Caution  ought  to  be  applied  in  drawing  too  rapid 
conclusions on its future evolution. 
In conclusion, although the growth of the card payment market during the last decade has been large, 
there  seems  still  to  be  considerable  potential  for  expansion,  mostly  through  displacement  of  cash 
payments, and most obviously in Sweden (fig. 7). Why are Swedes so suspicious of cards and such 
lovers  of  cash?  We  do  not  know  for  certain.  I  can  just  assure  you  that  it  is  not  due  to  successful 
marketing of cash by the Riksbank, even though we issue the currency and live on the seignorage. 
Cash has many advantages, no doubt about that. It is expensive to use, however, and in one way or 
another we all as bank customers pay for the use of it. For reasons of security and efficiency in retail 
payments, a more widespread use of cards would be desirable. 
Forces driving the development of the card payment market 
The forces of supply and demand shape the evolution of the card payment market in much the same 
manner as they influence the evolution of any other market. 
Demand  is  influenced  by  factors  such  as  acceptance,  convenience  and  relative  prices.  It  has 
sometimes been argued that demand for payment instruments is not price elastic - that relative prices 
do not greatly influence users' preferences for different payment instruments.1 The Nordic experience 
does  not  support  this  view.  The  rapid  expansion  of  card  payments  and  other  electronically  initiated 
instruments in Norway clearly point in a different direction. Norwegian consumers' shift of preferences 
followed  immediately  after banks' change of pricing strategy,  where (among other changes) a price 
was put on the use of cash (as a small fee on ATM withdrawals). In Sweden, as previously noted, the 
use of checks fell sharply when banks started to charge for their use, although the charge was fairly 
small. Of course, good substitutes must be readily available. But if alternative ways of payment are 
present, fees seem to matter and matter a lot. So, one may suspect, if and when banks feel ready to 
charge for the use of cash, this is likely to give a big kick to the card market. 
On the supply side, costs are obviously important. Clearly, the technological development of IT and 
telecommunications  has  helped  in  cutting  costs.  Economies  of  scale  and  network  effects  are  other 
important supply factors. Economies of scale imply that cost per transaction fall when the number of 
transactions increases. Network effects imply that the number of terminals that accept a particular card 
greatly affect the utility of the user. The larger the number of payment terminals that a bank can install, 
the happier will be the users and the larger the share of the card payment market the bank will have. 
Economies of scale and network effects both increase the incentives for co-operation between card 
issuers in establishing common standards and communication between systems. In Sweden and in 
the  other  Nordic  countries  as  well,  banks  have  a  long  tradition  of  cooperation  in  using  common 
infrastructure  and  implementing  common  standards,  perhaps  more  so  than  in  many  other  regions. 
This  is  likely  to  have  contributed  to  the  rapid  expansion  of  the  card  payment  market  in  the  Nordic 
countries. There are some country specific differences, though. As should be expected, the number of 
payments per capita increases with the number of terminals installed (fig 8). At least for Sweden, there 
seems to be remaining positive network effects that may further expand the market. 
                                                      
1   See for example Humphrey, Pulley and Vesala (1996): "Cash, paper, and electronic payments: a cross-country analysis", 
Journal  of  Money,  Credit,  and  Banking,  Nov.  This  is  an  econometric  study  of  different  factors  affecting  the  choice  of 
payment instruments. The price coefficient had no statistical significance in this study. However the data set was poor. This 
result  was  later  revised  in  the  Norwegian  study:  Humphrey,  Kim  and  Vale  (1998):  Realizing  the  gains  from  electronic 
payments: costs, pricing and payment choice, Norges Bank. 
  Consideration of risk 
Risk  considerations  are  always  important  in  card  transactions.  Consumers  in  countries  where 
criminality is low, such as Switzerland and Japan (and Sweden for that matter), tend to favour cash 
payments to a larger extent than in countries, where the risks of carrying large amounts of cash are 
higher. Problems in the handling of risk are also likely to be behind the disappointing development of 
e-commerce. The evolution of a digital market is believed to have been partly hindered by the lack of 
sufficiently secure payment instruments. For card issuers and banks matters of security are crucially 
important.  There  is,  as  always,  a  trade  off  between  risk  and  the  cost  of  avoiding  risk  by  adopting 
security  enhancing  technology.  When  technology  becomes  less  costly,  more  of  it  will  be  used. 
E-commerce is likely to benefit from that development. 
Incentives  to  reduce  risks  are  important  and  drive  the  current  technological  developments  in  the 
market.  Costs  for  fraud  are  very  high.  Moreover,  these  costs  are  increasing  in  most  countries. 
Although card frauds are relatively less frequent in Sweden than in many other countries, the need for 
enhanced security features at the international level will make Swedish card issuers follow the global 
trend. If  we do not,  we take the risk of becoming a secure haven, attracting  large numbers of card 
fraudsters. Whether Sweden should have been even quicker to adopt the new technology is a matter 
for discussion. 
Currently we are facing the transition from magnetic stripe cards to chip cards. The migration to the 
global EMV standard (EMV= Europay, MasterCard & Visa) is on its way. The first pilot will start this 
spring; the national roll out will follow in the autumn. It is not easy to forecast how long the technology 
migration  will  take.  All  cards  have  to  be  replaced  with  the  new  EMV  compatible  chip  and  payment 
terminals  need  to  be  upgraded.  This  process  may  take  some  time.  Market  players  expect  that  the 
change  of  rules  announced  by  Visa  and  MasterCard  regarding  the  distribution  of  credit  risks,  to  be 
implemented from January 2005, may considerably speed  up the migration process (Currently card 
issuers bear full credit risk, but from that date, credit risk will fall on the party, card issuer or bank not 
implementing the EMV technology). I trust that the introduction of the EMV cards will be thoroughly 
covered by the afternoon speakers, so I will leave the subject here. 
Central Bank Involvement 
Why should a central bank care about the card market? Is the market not better handled by the private 
sector without public intervention? 
According  to  the  law,  the  Riksbank  is  to  promote  a  safe  and  efficient  payment  system.  Like  most 
central banks, the Riksbank is heavily involved in large value payments, running and providing credit 
to the RIX-system, where payments can be made in central bank money. Here the central bank role is 
simple to explain. But  why should  we be  involved  in  the small  value payments  handled in the card 
market? Safety problems, although they may be important, are usually not systemic in nature. And in a 
well-functioning  market,  economic  efficiency  should  be  attained  by  the  market  itself,  without  public 
intervention. 
In my view, central bank involvement is appropriate only in the cases of market failure, coordination 
problems  of  some  magnitude  or  the  presence  of  obstacles  outside  the  market  itself.  Usually,  they 
relate to efficiency rather than safety.2 Typically, we would ask questions such as 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
To  answer  these  questions,  we  follow  the  market  for  retail  payments  and  we  try  to  exchange 
information and cooperate with other relevant public and private bodies. In the card payment market, 
issues of competition, pricing and security are of particular importance. I shall comment shortly on the 
first two of these. 
Are there legal and regulatory impediments to market development and innovation? 
Are market conditions competitive? 
Are security and operating standards and infrastructure arrangements efficient? 
Are settlement services, however provided, safe and efficient? 
                                                      
2   Even though systemic risks are not an issue in the card market, other risks may be highly relevant. Operational risks in 
particular are important since operational disturbances may give rise to substantial costs for society as a whole. 
  The  market  for  card  payments  is  characterised  by  the  presence  of  strong  network  effects  in 
combination  with  economies  of  scale.  To  exploit  these  effects  players  that  otherwise  compete  with 
each other have to cooperate. This cooperation is manifested in common standards and a common 
infrastructure.  It  is  an  important  cooperation,  which  has  the  potential  of  providing  inexpensive  and 
convenient payments services to the public in a way that would otherwise be impossible. 
There is, however, another side of the coin. High market concentration may reduce the competitive 
pressure  and  thus  the  functioning  of  the  market.  Market  power  may  be  abused.  The  effect  from 
concentration on incentives to invest in research and development is ambiguous. High concentration 
may also make it difficult to establish new payment instruments and systems. It is not obvious that the 
market by itself can strike the right balance between cooperation and competition. 
Turning  to  the  pricing  of  card  products,  the  Riksbank,  in  dialogue  with  the  banks,  has  launched  a 
research project related to retail payments. The aim is to investigate how well the price structure for 
retail  payment  services  reflects  the  underlying  production  costs  for  these  services. When  prices  for 
retail services, such as the use of cards or cash, are transparent and reflect the cost of production, 
they give incentives to efficient use of each instrument. Again, if actual costs of cash services were 
transparent to consumers and if the use of cash was priced according to the cost of providing cash 
services, the use of cards would probably increase substantially. I am sure that we will move in that 
direction, even though consumer acceptance of paying for the use of cash will increase only at a slow 
pace. 
Thank you.
