Durmuş Yilmaz: Press conference for the presentation of the inflation 
report  
Speech by Mr Durmuş Yilmaz, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at 
the press conference for the presentation of the second issue of the Inflation Report, Central 
Bank of the Republic of Turkey, Ankara, 30 April 2008. 
 Distinguished Guests and Members of the Press, 
Welcome  to  the  press  conference  for  the  presentation  of  the  second  issue  of  the  2008 
Inflation Report, one of the most important communication tools of the full fledged inflation 
targeting regime that we have been implementing. 
In  this  conference,  I  would  like  to  give  you  a  short  summary  of  our  evaluations  and  the 
Central Bank’s inflation forecasts in the Inflation Report which will be posted on our website 
later today. 
Inflation developments 
1.  
Dear Members of the Press, 
I would like to start with a general assessment of inflation developments.  
The  monetary  tightening  exercised  since  mid-2006  has  been  successful  in  achieving  a 
significant reduction in underlying inflation. The fall in headline inflation, however, has been 
more limited, owing mainly to factors largely beyond the control of monetary policy, such as 
developments  in  food,  energy,  and  administered  prices.  Consumer  prices  rose  by  3.1 
percent  in  the  first  quarter  of  2008  and  annual  inflation  reached  9.15  percent  (Figure  1). 
Thus, as of March, annual inflation exceeded the upper limit of the uncertainty band, which 
was 9.1.

Prolonged  increases  in  food,  energy  and  commodity  prices  have  recently  led  to  upward 
pressure on headline inflation and in turn to upward revisions in inflation forecasts in many 
countries  across  the  world.  Turkey  is  not  an  exception  in  this  regard,  as  the  deviations  of 
inflation  from  our  forecasts  can  be  mostly  attributed  to  these  factors.  For  instance,  our 
BIS Review 62/2008 
 1
forecasts in the October 2006 Inflation Report suggested that inflation would converge to the 
4 percent target at the end of the first quarter of 2008. The forecast was based on a scenario 
in  which  food  inflation  moderated  to  levels  comparable  with  medium  term  targets  and  oil 
prices  remained  stable  at  60  USD  per  barrel.  However,  oil  prices  continued  to  rise  and 
averaged around 100 USD per barrel in the first quarter of 2008. Moreover, annual food price 
inflation  has  continued  to  remain  at  elevated  levels,  reaching  13.4  percent  in  March.  As  a 
consequence, 6.13 percentage points of the 9.15 percent annual CPI inflation in March came 
from food and energy items (Figure 2).

Both  domestic  and  international  developments  have  played  a  part  on  the  course  of  food 
prices. A prolonged shortage of rainfall in Turkey resulted in low crop yields in 2007, which 
turned into an adverse supply shock. Strong global demand for food and continued elevation 
in agricultural commodity prices further added to domestic food inflation through the external 
trade channel. Recently, adverse impacts of these factors have been quite visible especially 
in processed food prices. Accordingly, annual food inflation maintained its high levels with a 
marked  contribution  of  about  2.3  points  to  the  3.1  percent  year-to-date  headline  inflation. 
Therefore, food prices became the main factor impeding the disinflation process (Figure 3, 
Table 1). 
Adverse  developments  in  energy  prices  have  been  another  major  factor  in  slowing  the 
disinflation  process.  Rising  oil  prices  continued  to  lead  to  significant  hikes  in  the  prices  of 
fuel-oil products. Elevated oil prices have also affected the prices of energy items in housing 
utilities, including electricity tariff rates, which were adjusted upwards by a significant margin. 
Consequently,  the  contribution  of  energy  items to  year-to-date  CPI  inflation  reached  about 
0.9 percentage points.

Distinguished Guests; 
The decline in services inflation came to a halt in the first quarter of 2008. Elevated food and 
energy prices have been exerting upward pressures on the prices of catering and transport 
services.  Rents  and  other  services,  on  the  other  hand,  have  continued  to  decelerate 
(Figure 4).

Figure 5: Main Inflation Indicators and Policy Rates 
Distinguished Guests, 
Global  uncertainties  and  their  reflections  on  the  domestic  financial  markets  have  led  to 
exchange  rate  movements,  which  in  turn  affected  March  inflation  especially  through  the 
prices  of  fuel  and  high-tech  consumer  durables.  The  first  round  effects  of  exchange  rate 
pass-through are expected to continue in the short term.  
Inflation  in  CPI  excluding  food,  energy  and  tobacco  items  remained  flat  over  the  previous 
quarter  and  remained  at  4.8  percent,  confirming  that  the  rise  in  inflation  can  be  mostly 
attributed to factors beyond the control of monetary policy (Figure 5). The recent rise in core 
inflation  indicators  has  reinforced  the  risks  related  to  second-round  impacts  of  previous 
shocks.

Dear Members of the Press, 
Elevated  prices  of  crude  oil,  food/agricultural  products  and  other  commodities  continue  to 
exert inflationary pressure (Figure 6). As a result, inflation has recently been rising worldwide 
(Figure  7).  Inflation  in  developed  economies  edged  up  in  the  last  quarter  of  2007,  while 
emerging economies with inflation targeting have faced an upward trend since June 2007. By 
the end of the first quarter annual inflation in Turkey was 9.2 percent, which is below its end-
2006 level of 9.7 percent. During the same period, the average inflation in emerging market 
economies with inflation targeting rose from 3.4 percent to 6.1 percent.

Monetary policy response 
2.  
The CBRT has been clear about its approach in responding to inflation resulting from factors 
beyond  its  control:  Monetary  policy  will  tolerate  the  first  round  effects,  but  will  promptly 
respond to any deterioration in overall pricing behavior. I want to emphasize that the policy 
pursued since September 2007 should be interpreted in this context.  
In September 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to initiate the rate cuts, 
which had already been signaled earlier in the year. Accordingly, policy rates were lowered 
by 225 basis points between September 2007 and February 2008 (Table 2).

In the January 2008 Inflation Report, we indicated that uncertainties in the global economy, 
hikes in electricity prices, and risks to price setting behavior had compelled the CBRT to be 
more  responsive  to  incoming  information.  The  letter  also  expressed  that  further  monetary 
accommodation  would  depend  on  the  factors  affecting  the  medium  term  inflation  outlook. 
Food and energy prices and global uncertainties have continued to rise since then, feeding 
into  inflation  expectations  and  core  prices  and  thus  increasing  the  risks  regarding  price 
setting behavior and the degree of inflation persistence. Consequently, the MPC decided to 
suspend  the  rate  cuts  in  the  March  meeting  and  announced  in  the  April  meeting  a  clear 
tightening bias to be exercised when deemed necessary.  
Inflation outlook 
3.  
Distinguished Guests and Members of the Press, 
Now  that  I  have  summarized  inflation  and  monetary  policy  developments,  I  would  like  to 
share with you our evaluations of the inflation and monetary policy outlook.  
Current  supply  and  demand  conditions  support  the  downward  trend  in  inflation.  Data  on 
consumer  credits  suggest  that  monetary  conditions  continue  to  be  non-accommodative. 
Annual  growth  rates  in  automobile  and  housing  loans  are  at  lower levels  compared  to  the 
periods of vigorous domestic demand (Figure 8). Although consumer credits displayed signs 
of recovery in 2007, the cautious monetary policy stance and the tightening in global credit 
conditions are likely to restrain credit expansion in the forthcoming period.

The  sharp  slowdown  in  the  second  half  of  2006  created  some  slack  in  the  economy.  The 
recent  methodological  change  in  national  accounts  led  to  a  limited  upward  revision  in  our 
output  gap  measure  and  hence  did  not  change  the  inflation  outlook.  Looking  ahead,  we 
expect a continued moderation in economic activity and non-farm employment on the back of 
rising precautionary saving due to global and domestic uncertainties (Figure 9).

Accordingly, demand and capacity conditions are expected to continue to support disinflation 
(Figure 10). Therefore, assuming that supply shocks gradually fade out over time, headline 
inflation is expected to decelerate.

Distinguished Members of the Press, 
The domestic currency has depreciated by more than 15 percent in nominal terms since the 
beginning  of  the  year.  Notwithstanding  the  expected  deceleration  in  the  core  inflation 
indicators in the medium term, the first round impacts of the exchange rate pass-through may 
be significant in the short term (Figure 11).

Figure 12: Benchmark Interest Rate and Policy Rate 
Longer term interest rates have increased lately due to the rising risk premium (Figure 12). 
Although  higher  interest  rates  contain  domestic  demand  and  thus  support  disinflation,  the 
impact of the higher risk premium on pricing behavior should be closely monitored. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CBT survey of expectations suggests that economic agents expect inflation to pursue a 
downward  trend.  One  year  forward  expectations  are  at  7  percent,  whereas  2-year  ahead 
inflation expectations stand at around 6 percent. However, the recent upward movement in 
expectations has increased the risks to price setting behavior (Figure 13).

Distinguished Guests, 
In the January Inflation Report, we envisaged a correction in food inflation justified by more 
favorable weather conditions. However, the long-awaited correction in food prices has not yet 
materialized.  Processed  food  inflation  has  accelerated  even  further  on  the  back  of  rising 
global demand and elevated agricultural commodity prices.  
At  this  point,  global  perceptions  regarding  the  persistency  of  the  increases  in  agricultural 
commodity  prices  in  the  medium  term  have  become  stronger.  In  this  conjuncture,  the 
analysis  of  the  forecasts  for  world  food  prices  and  their  impacts  on  domestic  food  prices 
bears great importance. In this respect, we included the summary of a particular study in the 
Inflation Report. The said study analyzes in detail the price developments observed in food 
products, determines their relative impacts by excluding the determinants of domestic food 
prices  and  accordingly  makes  assessments  for  the  future.  As  stated  in  the  study,  the 
reinforcement of global perceptions regarding the persistency of the increases in agricultural 
commodity  prices in the medium term indicates that upward risks on domestic food prices 
and especially on processed food prices will continue in the foreseeable future.  
In  this  framework,  we  revised  our  forecasts  for  medium  term  inflation  to  incorporate  more 
conservative  assumptions  on  food  prices  and  we  have  raised  our  assumptions  for  food 
inflation  to 13  percent  for  the  year  2008  and  8  percent  for  the  year  2009.  These  changes 
have led to upward revisions in our inflation forecasts, by about 1.2 points for 2008 and 1.1 
points for 2009. 
The  assumption  on  oil  prices  in  the  January  Inflation  Report  stood  at  USD  85  per  barrel. 
However,  oil  prices  averaged  about  USD  100  in  the  first  quarter  of  2008.  Considering  the 
most recent developments, we have revised our assumption for oil prices to USD 105 per 
barrel.  Moreover,  we  assume  that  electricity  tariffs  will  be  adjusted  as  required  by  the 
automatic pricing mechanism. These changes imply upward revisions in our forecasts by 0.9 
points for end-2008, and 0.4 points for end-2009.  
Although weak domestic demand should limit the second round effects of the exchange rate 
pass-through, the first round impact of the recent depreciation is estimated to be close to 2-
percentage points at the end of 2008, which implies further upward revision in our forecasts.  
Within the framework that I have drawn up so far, we now forecast inflation to be around 9.3 
percent at the end of 2008. Our medium term forecasts suggest, with 70 percent probability 
that,  under  the  assumption  of  a  measured  and  gradual  tightening  towards  mid-2008  and 
constant  policy  rates  thereafter  for  the  rest  of  2008,  inflation  will  be  between  4.9  and  8.5 
percent (mid point 6.7) at the end  of 2009 (Figure 14). Assuming a gradual moderation in 
food inflation, headline inflation is expected to decelerate to 4.9 percent at the end of 2010 
and to 4 percent by mid-2011. We expect non-food inflation to be lower than these figures.

Distinguished Guests and Members of the Press, 
Supply shocks have turned out to be more persistent than expected, increasing the risks to 
the  second  round  effects  and  necessitating  a  significant  upward  revision  in  our  inflation 
forecasts.  Accordingly,  monetary  policy  has  already  assumed  a  more  cautious  stance  in 
order  to  eliminate  the  materialization  of  potential  second  round  effects.  Ensuring  a  steady 
decline in inflation will likely require tight monetary policy to be maintained for an extended 
period. Even then, the earliest time for reaching the 4 percent medium term targets is likely to 
extend beyond two years. However, this does not mean that the Central Bank will implement 
a looser monetary policy in the forthcoming period. On the contrary, the forecasts that I just 
presented are based on a tighter monetary policy stance compared to the previous period. 
I would once again like to emphasize that any new data or information on the inflation outlook 
may lead to a change in the policy stance of the Central Bank. Therefore, the indicated path 
for the policy rates should not be perceived as a commitment on behalf of the CBT. 
Distinguished Guests, 
Revised projections suggest that the contribution of energy, food and services will be close to 
5  percent  at  the  end  of  2009.  In  other  words,  assuming  no  further  hikes  in  administered 
prices (except those implied by automatic pricing mechanisms), meeting the 4 percent target 
at the end of 2009 would be possible only if the prices of goods excluding food, energy and 
tobacco deflate by 3 percent. However, factors such as rising import prices, potential second 
round  impacts  of  supply  shocks,  and  the  structural  inertia  in  inflation  could  continue  to 
impose  downward  stickiness  in  goods  prices.  Therefore,  converging  to  the  medium  term 
target  of  4  percent  may  extend  beyond  two  years,  even  when  tight  monetary  policy  is 
maintained for an extended period. 
Under these circumstances, getting inflation back to the 4 percent by the end of 2009 would 
require offsetting the first round effects, and thus create undesired fluctuations in economic 
BIS Review 62/2008 
 11
activity and relative prices. That is why we envisage a framework in which inflation remains 
higher than 4 percent at the end of 2009. 
The  forecasts  presented  above  deserve  particular  attention,  given  that  inflation  is  likely  to 
stay above the target in the next two years. The forecasts should serve as anchors for the 
intermediate term, representing the inflation path that is likely to be followed on the way to 4 
percent medium term target. 
Risks and monetary policy 
4.  
Distinguished Guests, 
In the last part of my speech, I would like to mention the upside and downside risks regarding 
inflation and monetary policy in the upcoming period.  
Our revised forecasts are based on rather conservative assumptions, especially for food and 
energy  prices,  implying  that  downside  risks  are  as  significant  as  upside  risks.  In  the  April 
Inflation  Report,  we  provide  projections  under  alternative  scenarios  for  food  and  energy 
prices.  The  pessimistic  scenario  assumes  food  inflation  to  materialize  at  17,  11  and  10 
percent in the next three years, and oil prices to soar to 150 USD per barrel at the end of 
2009. Under this scenario, assuming that policy rates increase gradually throughout the year 
2008  and  then  stay  constant  for  a  while,  it  would  four  years  for  inflation  to  go  back  to  4 
percent  (Figure  15).  The  other  scenario,  which  is  the  optimistic  one,  assumes  that  food 
inflation materializes at 9, 5 and 4 percent in the next three years, and oil prices eases to 85 
USD per barrel at the end of 2009. Under this scenario, assuming a limited rate hike in short 
term and gradual cuts starting from the last quarter, inflation would reach 4 percent at the 
end of 2010. Therefore, the materialization of upside risks would require further tightening of 
the monetary policy stance, while downward surprises in food and energy prices would be 
perceived as an opportunity to bring inflation back to the target in a shorter period.

BIS Review 62/2008
A  protracted  period  of  rising  food  and  energy  prices  have  led  to  significant  breaches  in 
inflation  targets  since  the  adoption  of  the  inflation-targeting  regime  and  consequently 
increased  the  stickiness  in  inflation  expectations,  as  economic  agents  have  become  more 
backward  looking.  Under  normal  conditions,  supply  shocks  are  expected  to  alter  relative 
prices  rather  than  the  underlying  inflation  trend.  Nevertheless,  the  fact  that  several  long-
lasting shocks appeared concurrently has increased the risks to price setting behavior. As a 
matter of fact, recent studies by the Central Bank reveal that economic agents have been 
increasingly  grounding  their  expectations  on  past  inflation  figures.  In  this  respect,  recent 
developments  in  the  pricing  behavior  and  the  underlying  inflation  trends  are  of  particular 
concern.  It  may  be  necessary  to  pursue  a  tighter  monetary  policy  should  the  price  setting 
behavior deteriorate.  
Distinguished Guests, 
Another  major  risk  to  the  inflation  outlook  is  a  sharper  than  expected  slowdown  in  global 
economic  activity,  which,  in  turn,  could  lead  to  further  volatility  in  financial  markets.  The 
eventual impact of financial turmoil on global economic activity triggered by mortgage loans 
in  the  US  economy  is  yet  to  be  seen.  These  uncertainties  have  been  dampening  the  risk 
appetite  and  thus  slowing  capital  flows  to  emerging  economies.  The  CBT  will  not  react  to 
temporary  fluctuations  in  financial  markets.  Yet,  we  will  not  hesitate  to  tighten  monetary 
policy in case of a significant worsening in the overall pricing behavior. 
Under current liquidity conditions, I believe it is useful to note that the Central Bank has the 
resilience to implement a strong monetary tightening within a short time. The recent cuts in 
the  amount  of  foreign  exchange  auctions,  reduced  FX  borrowing  of  the  Treasury  and  the 
increase in demand for money has led to a decline in the withdrawal of excess liquidity in the 
overnight market. The said tendency is expected to persist in the upcoming period, which will 
thus lead to relatively tighter monetary conditions. This framework not only allows the Central 
Bank to perform more resilient and efficient liquidity management but  also to adopt tighter 
monetary policy without the need for a Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. 
Finally, it may be useful to note that our medium-term projections assume that government 
expenditures will evolve in line with the official projections and that there will be no further 
increases  in  indirect  taxes  or  any  administered  price  adjustments.  Any  deviation  from  this 
assumption may alter the outlook for inflation and monetary policy. 
Distinguished Guests and Members of the Press, 
Inflation targets have been breached by a significant margin in the past two years as a result 
of exceptionally persistent supply shocks, and there is a considerable chance that the shocks 
are  likely  to  stay  for  a  while.  Besides,  the  ongoing  uncertainty  resulting  from  the  global 
economy has been increasing the risks related to the second round effects of these supply 
shocks. Our revised projections incorporating the latest developments suggest that in 2008 
and  2009  inflation  is  likely  to  materialize  at  higher  levels  than  4  percent.  In  light  of  these 
evaluations,  economic  agents  need  reference  values  in  order  to  establish  inflation 
expectations  in  the  short  term.  These  projections,  presented  by  the  Central  Bank,  are 
prepared  to  meet  this  need.  Our  projections  should  be  evaluated  as  the  intermediate 
indicators  to  be  taken  as  a  reference  on  the  way  to  the  4  percent  target.  Therefore,  we 
envisage a framework in which inflation forecasts serve as an anchor in the short term, while 
4 percent targets continue to be the medium term anchor. The accurate comprehension of 
this framework by the public, thus mapping out their economic plans accordingly will enhance 
the efficiency of expectations management. 
Distinguished Guests, 
Once  more  I  would  like  to  underline  that  extending  the  horizon  within  which  inflation 
converges to the target of 4 percent does not mean that monetary policy will be looser in the 
forthcoming period. On the contrary, the presented inflation forecasts are based on a tighter 
monetary  policy  stance  compared  to  the  previous  period.  Monetary  policy  will  be  more 
BIS Review 62/2008 
 13
responsive to bad news than good news in the period ahead. This approach reflects our firm 
commitment to attaining price stability. 
I  would  like  to  stress  that  prudent  monetary  policy  is  a  necessary  but  not  a  sufficient 
condition  in  itself  for  attaining  price  stability.  The  support  from  fiscal  policy  and  structural 
reforms are also critical in this respect. Sound fiscal policy has been one of the main factors 
in driving inflation down to single digits. The role of fiscal policy will continue to be critical on 
the road to price stability. Preserving the resilience of the economy, especially under current 
conditions, requires the continuation of fiscal discipline and structural reforms. In this respect, 
the  European  Union  accession  process  and  the  implementation  of  structural  reforms 
envisaged in the economic program remain to be of the utmost importance. Finally, I would 
like  to  conclude  my  speech  by  specially  emphasizing  that  advances  in  structural  reforms, 
which  would  improve  the  quality  of  fiscal  discipline  and  raise  productivity,  are  monitored 
closely by the CBRT with regard to their implications on macroeconomic and price stability. 
Thank you.
