Ranee Jayamaha: Access to finance and financial inclusion for women 
Speech by Dr Ranee Jayamaha, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at the 
Centre for Women's Research (CENWOR), Colombo, 4 April 2008. 
 Let me start by giving a general definition for access to finance and financial inclusion before 
assessing the status of women in these two areas, and then discuss the areas of focus in 
enhancing financial inclusion for women. 
What is access to finance? In simple terms, this means to provide an environment in which 
people, in general, have accesses to the formal financial system, through the use of different 
financial products at affordable prices. The access could be to any formal financial institution, 
market,  and  payment  system  or  to  a  financial  instrument,  including  savings,  loans, 
remittances and insurance services. 
What  is  financial  inclusion?  This  means  the  process  of  facilitating  those  sectors  and 
segments of the population that are outside, to become a part of the formal financial system 
and enrolling individuals or groups into the formal financial sector.  
Key entry points for financial inclusion 
These could be through: 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
Direct loans or banking facilities to the targeted vulnerable communities or groups;  
Facilitation  of  economic  activity  in  a  particular  geographical  area  of  operations  or 
location;  
Development  of  local  or  national  infrastructure  to  enable  a  particular  type  of 
business activity, which could then be practiced or performed by a group or groups 
which can include women; and  
Providing an enabling environment and/or enhancements for such economic activity 
to take place. The enabling environment includes laws, regulations, taxation, skills 
development, duty waivers, subsidies, etc. In this context, tax concessions and duty 
waivers  given  to  make  enterprises  be  “financially  inclusive”  are  often  forgotten.  In 
fact,  due  to  lack  of  awareness,  enhancement  of  access  to  finance  or  financial 
inclusion  that  has  already  taken  place  in  various  sectors,  and  the  enabling 
environment that has been created, are taken for granted with no value attached to 
them. 
Women’s contribution to economic development 
Let me now deal with the importance of women’s contribution to the economic development 
in Sri Lanka and assess whether financial inclusion of, and access to finance by women are 
on par with the contribution they make. 
Women  in  Sri  Lanka  have  been  engaged  in  economic  activities  over  centuries  of  history 
primarily  through  employment.  Due  to  low  productivity  and  inadequate  incomes  in  the 
agricultural sector, women in small farm families have moved from unpaid family labour to 
other occupations, in particular, to garment factories and employment abroad. According to 
employment  by  economic  activity,  as  at  the  3rd  quarter  of  2007,  of  the  total  occupation, 
women accounted for 35% and 26%, respectively, in agriculture and manufacturing. During 
2003-2007 of the estimated worker contracts abroad, on average, 65% have been females. 
Although there has been some impact following the removal of export quotas for garments

their  contribution 
under the multi-fiber agreement in 2005, the important point is that, in terms of employment, 
the female labour force has not suffered significantly. 
Women’s contribution to growth has been much more significant in the recent decades, given 
their enhanced involvement as garment and apparel factory workers, domestic helpers in the 
Middle East and other destinations, and tea plantation workers. In terms of foreign exchange 
inflows  during  2007,  garments  and  apparel  have  accounted  for  USD  3.3mn,  worker 
remittances  for  USD  2.5mn  and  tea  exports  for  USD  1.0mn.  Around  80%  of  exports  have 
been dependent largely on the fortunes of the garments industry in which over 90 per cent of 
employees  are  women.  The  3  export  processing  zones,  i.e.  Katunayake,  Biyagama  and 
Koggala,  the  increasing  number  of  industrial  estates  located  in  the  different  parts  of  the 
country, and around 150 rural garment factories, provide employment opportunities for young 
women  between  18-30  years.  Although  precise  statistics  are  not  available  to  indicate  the 
participation  of  women  or 
inflows, 
undoubtedly, women’s contribution has been very significant. Unfortunately, not only has the 
contribution of women not been highlighted or fully appreciated, but there has also been no 
focused attention to enhance access to finance by women or to increase financial inclusion 
of women. 
Of  the  approximately  20mn  population  in  Sri  Lanka,  50%  are  females.  The  same  ratio  is 
found  in  all  provinces  according  to  latest  data.  For  3  consecutive  years,  the  country  has 
achieved a growth over 6% and a growth rate of 6.8% has been recorded for 2007. However, 
women’s contribution in this 6.8% is hidden. As at the end of 2007, we have exceeded a per 
capita  income  of  US  $  1,600.  The  system  of  National  Accounts  or  other  systems  that  set 
standards  in  the  compilation  of  National  Income  have  recognized  the  need  for  separating 
women’s contribution to GDP but, so far, there is no acceptable formula for achieving this. 
Similarly,  the  gender  budgeting  that  started  in  Australia  and  South  Africa  has  not  been 
followed or continued by many countries. Sri Lanka too recognized that there is a need to 
separately account for gender contribution in the budget. In that regard, some of us managed 
to  include  a  couple  of  paragraphs  announcing  the  gender  budgeting  policy  in  the  1999 
Budget, but there has been no follow up since then.

Drawbacks in financial inclusion and uneven ground situation 
The banking and financial sector in the country must be strong for financial inclusion to take 
place. Our banking sector has been showing advancement and growth. The financial system 
is  stable  and  resilient.  The  financial  institutions  are  committed  to  engage  in  social 
responsibility related work as well, or to reach out to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, 
of which women occupy an important place. Despite the advancement of the financial sector 
and the resilience of the system as a whole, we are still unable to appreciate or criticize its 
commitment towards financial inclusion of and access to finance by women, due to lack of 
disaggregated  data  from  banks  and  financial  institutions.  This,  I  believe,  is  the  biggest 
drawback  in  initiating  policy  responses  to  remedy  the  deficiencies  in  financial  inclusion  of 
women. 
The  absence  of  balanced  regional  or  provincial  growth  is  another  important  drawback  in 
enhancing financial inclusion of women. GDP growth has been uneven throughout the post 
independent period. Growth in the Western Province has been around 50%, while all other 
provinces accounted for the balance. This uneven growth has resulted in a skewed income 
distribution, varying degree of poverty, marginalization and unemployment issues, as well as 
financial exclusion in the other regions of the country. However, the significant growth in the 
Western  Province  has  resulted  in  notable  enhancement  in  access  to  finance  and  financial 
inclusion.

Table  I  shows  that  as  at  the  end  of  2007,  there  were  678  banking  outlets  in  the  Western 
Province  out  of  a  total  branch  network  of  1,697  in  the  whole  country.  Accordingly,  8,417 
persons  have  been  served  by  a  bank  branch  in  the  Western  Province,  while  the  banking 
density in the Western Province has been 11.89. 50% of people are within one mile from a 
bank  and  with  ATM  facilities  within  a  radius  of  2-3  miles.  In  contrast,  according  to  latest 
available data, the Northern and Eastern provinces accounted for a share of 2.9% and 4.7% 
of the GDP during 2006. These two provinces had 61 and 80 branches, respectively, serving 
19,000 and 18,662 persons per branch. The banking density in the two districts was at a low 
level of 5.26 and 5.36, respectively. Given the conflict in these two areas, the limited branch 
network, outreach and lower banking density are understandable. It is now time to enhance 
financial inclusion in the recently liberated Eastern Province. What action is needed and how 
quickly it can be implemented are challenging tasks, but financial inclusion, in general, and 
for women, in particular, is an area that should be given priority. 
The main credit needs among people in low growth areas and with low incomes, in particular, 
women are:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
access to small, unsecured, fixed term loans in cash; 
quick access to credit without lengthy or intrusive application procedures; 
affordable weekly payments with no hidden or extra charges; 
automatic repayment arrangements, such as deduction from benefit or home visits 
by a collector; and 
opportunities  for  making  late  payments  or  rescheduling  loans  without  incurring 
charges when temporary financial problems occur. 
 If  anyone  of  these  or  a  combination  of  these  factors  tend  to  deny  access  to  financial 
institutions or to products, that is known as financial exclusion, which is often reflected as a 
symptom of poverty as well as a cause. As much as we are interested in financial inclusion, it 
is  also  necessary  to  reduce  financial  exclusion  to  a  minimum,  which  is  also  a  policy 
challenge. These are two sides of the same coin.

Visible areas of financial exclusion 
Financial exclusion and denial of access to credit exists in two clear areas, in particular, in 
formal credit markets and the payment system. According to available data, in Sri Lanka, at 
least 40 per cent of the farm households do not have access to formal sources of credit or 
bank accounts. The reliability of this number depends on the type of survey done and the 
source of information. Nevertheless, it is a significant number to work with. Comparatively, 
however, we are ahead in the region as 51 per cent of about 89 million farm households in 
India  have  no  access  to  formal  or  informal  sources  of  credit  while  73  per  cent  have  no 
access to formal sources of credit. Although both in India and Sri Lanka, the shares of non-
institutional sources of credit have decreased compared to the 1970’s and 1980’s, there still 
remains a significant gap in accessing the formal financial sector by men and women in rural 
areas and the unemployed in the urban areas. Among many reasons for financial exclusion 
of  women  from  the  formal  system,  however,  literacy  barriers  and  language  barriers  are 
becoming  less  important  factors.  It  is  primarily  the  approach  of  banks  and  financial 
institutions  and  the  strenuous  processes  and  procedures  adopted  by  them,  which  matters 
more in financial exclusion.  
The second important area of financial exclusion is the denial of access to efficient and safe 
payment  systems.  This  area  of  activity  is  unknown  to  many  and  it  has  been  taken  for 
granted. Among the main payment instruments, cash is straightforward. However, the other 
payment  instruments,  such  as  cheques,  bank  drafts,  electronic  payments,  card  payments 
etc., can have delays in both clearing and settlement, which can cause problems to those 
who  receive  money  through  these  payment  modes.  This  is  common  to  both  men  and 
women. Following the efforts made by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, cheques/bank drafts 
are  now  being  cleared  on  t+1  or  t+2  in  most  parts  of  the  country,  and  that  has  clearly 
enhanced access to finance through retail transactions. The receipt of remittances through 
non-bank  sources  or  various  money  transfer  systems  has  also  been  enhanced  following 
BIS Review 40/2008 
 5
countrywide  IT  and  payment  system  advancements.  In  more  recent  years,  therefore, 
financial exclusion in Sri Lanka has been greatly reduced.  
Initiatives for financial inclusion of women 
There are some initiatives taken, not only by Sri Lanka, but also in the South Asian region 
towards  financial  inclusion.  By  2005,  micro  finance  institutions  covered  at  least  35mn  of 
some  270mn  people  in  the  South  Asian  region  and  met  around  15%  of  the  overall  credit 
requirements of low-income families. In Sri Lanka, the coverage is particularly high at 60%. 
The  high  outreach  in  Sri  Lanka  is  based  on  an  extensive  network  of  community-based 
organizations that receive considerable government subsidies.  
Almost  all  rural  financial  institutions  in  Sri  Lanka  have  provided  easy  access  to  women, 
particularly in the villages, estates and among fishing communities. Financial institutions that 
are  directly  involved  in  this  area,  are  the  licensed  commercial  banks,  licensed  specialized 
banks,  micro  finance  institutions,  cooperative  rural  banks,  the  SANASA  Thrift  and  Credit 
Cooperative Movement, SEEDS and other non-governmental organizations. 
Let us examine the extent to which financial inclusion for women has taken place through the 
existing institutional network and assess the deficiencies and gaps, although we may not be 
able to do a comprehensive analysis. The participation of women in credit programs as at 
end December 2007 is given in the following table:

As  shown  in  the  table,  the  Small  Farmers  and  Landless  Credit  Project  (SFLCP),  Poverty 
Alleviation  Micro  Finance  Project  (PAMP)  and  SANASA  Thrift  and  Credit  Societies  have 
been successful in providing loan facilities at 93%, 76% and 70%, respectively, for women. 
Approximately  8,681  women  have  obtained  financial  and  credit  facilities  under  the  SFLCP 
revolving funds loan scheme, while 39,388 women have benefited under PAMP as at the end 
of 2007. Again, due to lack of statistics and information, it is difficult to assess the ratio of 
loans  granted  exclusively  for  women  by  commercial  banks.  Among  others,  the  Sarvodaya 
6 
 BIS Review 40/2008
(SEEDS) has been in the forefront, reporting a total loan value of Rs 1.9 billion at the end of 
2007, of which 67% has been for women borrowers. 
As shown in Table IV, exclusivity conditions are not necessarily applicable to Sri Lanka given 
the  large-scale  membership  of  women  in  the  widespread  banking  arm  of  the  Cooperative 
Societies,  i.e.  about  1,500  cooperative  rural  banks  and  7,400  Sanasa  Societies,  both 
providing  banking  and  financial  services.  In  effect,  in  the  micro  finance  delivery  chain,  Sri 
Lanka’s Cooperative Societies and Sanasa Societies appear to be very significant.

Women still feature significantly in the vulnerable groups and it is imperative to include them 
in  the  facilities  offered  by  the  formal  financial  sector.  However,  in  terms  of  micro  finance 
coverage of poor families, Sri Lanka covers 63 families, which is the highest in South Asia. 
Similarly,  women  account  for  4.3%  of  the  borrowing  clients.  Sri  Lanka  at  4.3%  is  below 
Bangladesh, which is at 13%, but way above others. We, in Sri Lanka, had high hopes of 
enhancing financial inclusion of women through the Millennium Development Goals, which 
would have provided a smooth path for financial inclusion for women. However, even after 
several rounds of discussions, the program has not got off the ground as yet.  
Recent initiatives taken by the Central Bank and the banking and financial sector  
As in India, banks and financial institutions in Sri Lanka, at the grass root levels, have been 
advised  to  engage  in  basic  banking  with  “no  frills”,  or  to  entertain  minimum  balances  and 
reduce  charges  where  possible  to  enhance  access  to  finance  and  financial  inclusion.  The 
recent efforts taken by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as well as some banking institutions 
have enhanced access to finance and financial inclusion. They are: 
10% mandatory credit to agriculture by banking sector; 
• 
Agency  banking  through  mobile  phones:  Permission  has  been  granted  to 
• 
commercial banks to provide facilities using telecommunication services to appoint a 
number  of  agents  to  enable  on  the  spot  banking  facilities  such  as  depositing  and 
BIS Review 40/2008 
 7
   withdrawing money and receiving remittances abroad through these agents located 
throughout the country; 
Upgrading of post offices to provide banking and financial services: The HSBC 
Bank has established links with post offices which are considered to be grass root 
financial  institutions  and  providing  access  to  finance  in  terms  of  drawing  their 
pensions, monthly allowances and, where possible, remittances from abroad. This 
initiative has helped to enhance financial inclusion as post offices are patronized by 
women as well; 
Setting up of a credit and debt management council by the Central Bank: to 
provide advice to individuals and companies on their credit problems and denial of 
access to finance, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has initiated this process; and 
Preparation  of  a  Micro  Finance  Regulatory  Act  by  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri 
Lanka: One of the impediments in Sri Lanka is that the system does not enable an 
effective  monitoring  system  through  a  regulatory  framework,  which  monitors 
progress  of  women  accessing  credit  and  their  financial  inclusion.  To  remedy  the 
problem, the Central Bank is now working on a Micro Finance Act, through which 
micro finance institutions will be brought under a prudential regulatory framework. 
Need for a comprehensive program to increase financial inclusion of women  
It is important to note that initiatives cannot be taken and implemented by the Government 
alone.  Government  could  perhaps  be  the  main  motivator  and  driver.  The  promotion  of 
women  entrepreneurial  activities  and  financial  inclusion  has  to  be  elevated  to  a  policy 
debate. There should be a serious commitment by banks and financial institutions, and their 
business development sections should be proactive and ensure that credit delivery to women 
engaged in relevant sectors is given priority.  
In  addition  to  the  major  infrastructure  development  projects,  many  village  level  enterprises 
and projects are coming up within a short period of time. For example, the newly liberated 
Eastern Province has potential for new opportunities for growth. Crop agriculture, the dairy 
industry,  fishing  industry  and  livestock  are  three  key  areas,  which  can  make  a  significant 
contribution to growth. Women’s participation in each of these activities is estimated to be 
high and there are clear opportunities for women, seeking banking and financial services.  
It  is  time  to  prepare  a  comprehensive  plan  and  that  should  have  new  entry  points  to 
accommodate  women’s  financial  requirements.  Some  of  the  new  entry  points  include  the 
following: 
• 
Information  technology  application  and  usage:  The  phenomenal  growth  in  the 
telecommunication industry, particularly in the mobile telephone sector, could serve 
as the main platform to enhance the delivery of credit to women and girls. Sri Lanka 
is fast moving towards a technology savvy population. However, many women and 
girls still do not use computers and newer payment modes available through mobile 
phones  and  cards.  In  India  and  Bangladesh,  many  disadvantaged  and  vulnerable 
groups,  women  and  children  in  particular,  have  benefited  immensely  from 
information 
to  have  better 
understanding of prices in the market and business processes. The Government’s 
Information,  Communication  and  Technology  (ICT)  Program  should  ensure  that 
more and more women are included so that women can use the ICT entry point to 
enhance financial inclusion.  
Introduce  products/supply  chain  focused  credit  facilities  and  payment 
instruments: Introduction of appropriate credit facilities as well as payment systems 
and instruments in commodity markets and production chains/supply chains seems 
to be new entry points to improve access to finance and financial inclusion. Women

 in agriculture can be driven towards a debt trap when prices collapse at the time of 
harvesting.  Although  it  is  common  to  both  men  and  women  in  agriculture,  losing 
regular incomes would be a bigger blow to women than men. There can be inland 
bills,  goods  receipt  vouchers  and  other  instruments  that  are  discountable  during 
such periods. This is a responsibility for banks and financial institutions. 
Let me sum up the substance in a few sentences. More than anything, there is an urgency 
on the part of CENWOR or Marga or any other institution to conduct research, surveys and 
statistical  analyses  to  assess  the  status  of  enhancement  of  access  to  credit  and  financial 
inclusion among women in Sri Lanka. It is hard to come to conclusions without adequate and 
reliable  statistics  or  even  to  initiate  policy  action  to  fill  in  gaps  that  exist  in  this  area.  It  is 
equally  important  for  the  relevant  Ministry  or  Ministries  and  other  public  and  private 
organizations  to  coordinate  and  prepare  a  strategic  plan  to  spearhead  the  campaign  of 
financial inclusion for women and suggest policy and operational measures as they deem fit. 
This  initiative  too  should  be  supported  by  well-recognized  research  institutions  like 
CENWOR. I hope the deliberations during the next few days would lead the way to prepare 
an action plan or road map to take forward the financial inclusion for women initiative.  
Thank you.
