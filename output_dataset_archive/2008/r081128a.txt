Jean-Pierre Roth: Central bank communication policies and the 
challenges posed by the financial crisis 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the 
Swiss  National  Bank  and  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Bank  for  International 
Settlements,  at  the  presentation  of  the  “BZ-Preis  für  Lokaljournalismus”,  Berne,  27 
November 2008. 
The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 The  financial  crisis  has  prompted  a  rekindling  of  press  interest  in  central  bank  operations, 
following a long period in which monetary authorities scarcely attracted any media attention. 
Our communication policy has thus been faced with new challenges in recent months. 
Today,  central  banks  operate  with  the  market,  rather  than  “against  the  market”,  as  in  the 
past. Financial market participants are therefore able to foresee central bank actions. Since 
the early 2000s, our communication policy has focused on transparency, and our experience 
with  this  has  been  positive.  Thus,  transparency  increases  the  effectiveness  of  monetary 
policy. 
Yet,  in  the  recent  financial  turbulence,  transparency  in  monetary  policy  operations  also 
turned out to be a double-edged sword, as communication problems arose. Indeed, there is 
a risk that operations to provide extraordinary liquidity assistance will impair the reputation of 
the  recipient  organisations,  and  thereby  destabilise  the  market.  There  are  a  number  of 
possible solutions with which a balance can be achieved between transparency and stability.
