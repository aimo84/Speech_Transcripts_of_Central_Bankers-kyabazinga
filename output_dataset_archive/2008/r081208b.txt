Jens Thomsen: Ultra long-term financial instruments 
Speech by Mr Jens Thomsen, Member of the Board of Governors of the National Bank of 
Denmark, at the OECD Seminar: ”The pension payout phase: Annuities and implications for 
financial markets”, Paris, 12 November 2008. 
 Prologue 
Today I have two messages for you: The positive news is that people today live longer than 
ever  before.  However,  this  implies  that  if  people  are  not  working  longer,  they  may  outlive 
their  financial  reserves  and  may  at  some  point  need  to  reduce  their  standard  of  living,  cf.

 Introduction 
During  the  last  half  century  the  ageing  of  world  population  has  increased  rapidly.  On  one 
hand,  the  decrease  in  fertility  rates  in  past  decades  and  on  the  other  the  higher  life 
expectancy at older age have caused a sharp increase in the current old age dependency. 
The  trend  of  population  ageing  shows  no  sign  of  a  turn,  quite  the  opposite:  The  world 
population is expected to age at increasing speed, cf. Slide 3.

Living  longer  in  good  health  is  a  fantastic  accomplishment  from  the  society  to  which 
improvements  in  health  care,  nutrition  and  sanitation  have  contributed,  cf.  Slide  4.  On  the 
other  hand,  the  increasing  life  expectancy  –  in  particular  the  increasing  life  expectancy  at 
retirement  age  –  poses  challenges  to  individuals,  governments,  labour  markets  and  life 
insurance and pension sector, cf. Slide 5.

Demographic  changes,  such  as  increasing  life  expectancy,  imply  risks  for  the  financial 
institutions. Longevity risk is the risk that individuals live longer than expected. The apparent 
upward  trend  in  life  expectancy  is  manageable  but  it  is  the  speed  and  magnitude  of  the 
change  in  life  expectancy  that  involves  the  risk:  The  life  expectancy  of  the  current 
generations may deviate substantially from the course projected today and that could imply 
problems to the pension sector depending on issued guarantees, cf. Slide 6.

 Thus far, the increases in life expectancy have been systematically under-estimated, which 
has  lead  to  under-estimation  of  the  number  of  elderly  and  old-age  dependency.  As  a

consequence, pension scheme funding strategies have to some extent been inadequate, cf.

 Retirement saving 
From an individual's point of view longevity raises a financial question: Will there be enough 
resources to sustain an adequate life quality if life expectancy increases? The individuals that 
hold  a  pension  plan  where  the  retiree  bears  investment  and  longevity  risk  now  have  to 
become portfolio managers and decide upon the portfolio in an environment of uncertainty 
with no appropriate instruments for hedging the uncertainties, cf. Slide 8.

 BIS Review 152/2008
Some countries have increased general retirement age so that the dependency of retirement 
savings  can  decrease  while  retirement  savings  increase.  In  Denmark,  for  instance,  the 
Labour Market Commission's new proposal is to start to extent retirement age by a half-a-
year  every  year  between  2009  and  2012.  The  previous  political  agreement  on  welfare 
adjustment from 2006 stated that the extension would begin in 2019, cf. Slide 9.

 Retirement  saving  is  exposed  to  a  number  of  risks  depending  of  the  form  of  saving. 
However, longevity and macroeconomic risks affect all forms of retirement saving, cf. Slide

Depending on the type of pension plan, it is either the sponsor or the retiree that bears the 
longevity and investment risk. As the defined benefit retirement plans are being reduced in 
favour  of  defined  contribution  plans  the  risks  are  shifted  from  the  sponsors  to  individuals. 
Some  sponsors  have  attempted  to  renegotiate  the  agreed  pension  plans  with  the  retirees 
within  the  scope  of  the  pension  contracts  to  take  into  account  the  longevity  risk.  Anyhow, 
appropriate  risk  management  for  interest  rate,  inflation  and  longevity  risks  are  needed,  cf. 
Slide 11. 
 
Types of pension plans
Defined benefit plan
• Benefit determined 
by a set formula
Defined contribution plan
• Benefit depends on contributed 
amount and investment returns
• Sponsor bears

No matter who bears the risks,
instruments for investment and longevity risk bearing 
and hedging are needed

 Long-term government bonds 
The  ultra-long  government  bonds  are  not  a  recent  invention.  Perpetuals  were  used  in  war 
financing for example in United Kingdom that in 1919 issued two ultra-long bonds, 57-year 
"Victory  Bond"  and  71-year  "Funding  Loan".  Today  many  governments  have  long-dated 
outstanding loans with maturities up to 50 years. The issued ultra-long bonds tend to end up 
in investors' buy-and-hold positions, which affects bond liquidity. In Germany, for instance, 
the turnover ratio of the 10-year Bund is almost the double compared to the 30-year Bund, cf.

 Supply of ultra-long bonds is small compared to the size of pension fund and life insurance 
company portfolios. For instance in USA, the supply of government and corporate long-term 
bonds is only 10 per cent of the size of life insurance sector's investments and pension funds' 
assets, cf. Slide 13.

 Moreover, many countries have lately introduced new pension regulations requiring pension 
fund  managers  to  update  their  pension  plan  assumptions  and  apply  mark-to-market 
approach in valuation of risks. As a result many companies have implemented asset liability 
risk  management  (ALM),  which  implies  a  closer  linkage between  pension  fund  assets  and 
liabilities  and  an  increased  demand  for  long-term  bonds,  cf.  Slide  14.  Together  with  the 
limited supply of the long-term bonds this has lead to increasing use of derivative instruments

 Markets for longevity hedging 
Against this background there is an increasing interest in new instruments that can be used 
to hedge longevity risk. The 2004 EIB announcement of longevity bond issuance generated a 
wide  interest  and  a  lot  of  attention.  However,  the  issue  was  later  withdrawn  without  being 
issued;  According  to  anecdotal  evidence,  this  was  mainly  because  the  pension  industry 
found the price of coverage on longevity risk too high, cf. Slide 15.

hedging longevity risk

The largest hinder for development of longevity risk market is that the market lacks interested 
buyers  of  the  risk.  The  natural  investors  –  who  would  benefit  from  unexpected  rise  in  life 
expectancy  –  such  as  pharmaceutical  companies  and  care  providers  are  marginal  in  size 
compared  to  the  longevity  risk  holders  and  may  be  hindered  to  enter  into  longevity  risk 
transactions due to corporate governance reasons, cf. Slide 16.  
Size mismatch
Buyers of longevity risk
• Pharmaceutical companies
• Care providers
• Asset managers
Holders of longevity risk
• Pension funds and insurance companies 
through provision of annuities
• Governments through state pensions
• Many companies 
through pension schemes

 Another obstacle for development of longevity risk market is that thus far the packaging of 
longevity  risk  has  not  appealed  to  both  sellers  and  buyers  of  the  risk,  cf.  Slide  17.  Life 
insurance  and  pension  sector  needs  to  transfer  very  specific  risks  while  the  potential 
investors want a standardised product with high level of liquidity, cf. Slide 18.

 The role of the private sector 
Pension  funds  and  life  insurance  companies  are  experts  in  management  of  longevity  risk. 
Yet  they  are  heavily  exposed  to  this  risk  category  and  therefore  they  have  an  interest  in 
hedging some of the exposure. From the investor side longevity risk is very appealing due to 
its  low  correlation  with  the  yield  of  other  financial  instruments.  Nevertheless,  the  attractive 
contribution  in  asset  managers'  portfolios,  the  longevity  instruments  have  failed  to  attract 
buyers, cf. Slide 19.

 BIS Review 152/2008
Until now the private sector has used other types of hedging tools in longevity hedging: 
1. 
The pension sector has managed liabilities related to longevity risk without specific 
hedging instruments. Thus the exposure to longevity has been part of the pension 
sector's overall risk management. 
Reinsurance  companies  have  provided  capital  to  the  pension  sector  seeking 
hedging opportunities. 
The pension sector has also transferred their pension contracts to external investors 
who have assumed the contractual obligations, cf. Slide 20.

 The role of governments 
Regarding  the  limited  supply  of  instruments  that  could  be  used  in  longevity  risk  hedging, 
governments  could  issue  ultra-long  bonds  in  larger  quantities  to  help  in  liability  duration 
management.  However,  it  should  be  stressed  that  in  many  countries  this  would  need  a 
change of mandate for the debt management office.  
In  addition,  potential  issuers  of  longevity  instruments  should  keep  in  mind  that  the  world 
financial  markets  are  open  and  that  there  could  be  a  considerable  international  investor 
interest to buy such a product. Hence, it is difficult to target the longevity instrument to the 
domestic pension sector.  
Governments  could  produce  a  reliable  and  widely  accepted  longevity  index  that  private 
sector longevity bond issuers could use as an unbiased benchmark to their bonds. Recently 
several private sector entities have launched longevity indices to be used as benchmark to 
various  risk  transfer  instruments.  Nevertheless,  standardisation  in  this  area  has  yet  to 
emerge, cf. Slide 21.

 Governments  could  issue  longevity  bonds,  which  would  serve  as  benchmark  similar  to 
government yield curve and act as a catalyst in developing a private sector longevity bond 
market.  However,  the  governments  are  heavily  exposed  to  longevity  risk  through  public 
pension systems and social security schemes, cf. Slide 22.

 In  the  end,  nothing  is  certain  in  life  except  death  and  taxes,  cf.  Slide  23.  The  need  for 
development in market for longevity risk transfer is apparent. In view of the innovation seen 
in  other  financial  areas,  it  is  not  impossible  that  a  private  market  for  longevity  bonds  will 
emerge, although not necessarily based on the product structures known today.
