In post-war Germany  there has been a broad consensus about the importance of a stable currency across all political groupings. The bitter consequences of two previous hyperinflations as well as the positive experience gained with the D-Mark and its strength played a major role in this. In the recent past  however  the public debate has sometimes caused doubts to be raised concerning how far this consensus still goes. Admittedly  there have often been similar disputes in post-war history. One has only to remember the controversy surrounding the D-Mark appreciations in the sixties  when the relationship between internal monetary stability and external exchange rate stability first became an issue. Or the arguments in the seventies about the spurious alternative of more inflation or more unemployment. Ultimately  however  all these controversies did not seriously jeopardise the consensus on stability; if anything  they tended to strengthen it  in fact. New discussion on stability In the run-up to the introduction of European monetary union and against the backdrop of very sharp exchange rate changes in the first half of the nineties  the debate about the importance of monetary stability -- at least in some of its forms -- seems to have gained a new quality. For example  it is not only the trade-off between inflation and unemployment -- that had been thought to have been overcome -- which has been revived recently in a number of comments made by industry  the trade unions and politicians. In view of the degree of price stability achieved  adherence to a policy of non-inflationary growth is occasionally even brought into discredit as a deflationary policy. Perhaps even more frequently one hears the proposition that foreign exchange rate stability must purportedly assume priority over internal price stability -- exchange rate stability evidently meaning the nominal and not the real (price level-adjusted) stability of exchange rates. A sustained low external value of the D-Mark has not infrequently even been regarded as necessary (or at least beneficial) for the German economy  regardless of its implications for internal monetary stability. In the recent past  this debate has also increasingly become part of the wider discussion about monetary integration in Europe. It is thus acquiring a new dimension  even going as far as postulating European monetary union at all costs; in other words  a monetary union which would tend to result in a soft rather than a strong euro. At any rate  there are a number of participants in the current discussion (in Germany  too) who -- without saying it so explicitly  of course -- evidently regard the changeover to the euro as a welcome opportunity of lessening the D-Mark’s former external strength. The open or covert advocates of a weakening of the currency on competitive grounds obviously fail to recognise the interrelationship between internal and external stability. They overlook the fact that  in the past  Germany was regularly among those countries with the lowest interest rate level world-wide -- precisely because of the stability of its currency. That was and continues to provide a strong competitive edge which cannot be rated too highly  quite apart from the generally cost-curbing effects of monetary stability. The fact that such depreciation strategies are at variance with the aim of the Maastricht Treaty and even more so with its interpretation by the Bundestag  the Bundesrat and BIS Review 141/1996 - 2 - the Federal Constitutional Court seems either not to be taken into consideration or to be deliberately accepted. The Bundesbank’s adherence to internal monetary stability has led to it being accused of an undue stability policy bias  or even of being obsessed with stability. Bundesbank in favour of a stability union To avoid any misunderstanding: the Bundesbank is committed to the road to European monetary union laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. In the relevant bodies at national and European level it is collaborating intensively in solving the complex and by no means easy technical tasks involved -- these range from harmonising the hitherto very different monetary policy instruments in Europe  putting in place the organisational and legal framework for the European Central Bank and the euro  to a fundamentally new and modernised payment system. All this work should not be underestimated. The preparations have to be advanced to a stage which enables the European Central Bank Council to take decisions immediately after it has been established. The European Central Bank System has to be fully operational and functionally viable right from the very first day of monetary union. And the set of instruments then in force must not put individual banking groups at a disadvantage or jeopardise the benefits of the decentralised banking structure which obtains  particularly in Germany  and the dominant long-term orientation of the markets. As important as this intensive collaboration in the technical preparation of monetary union may be  what is of even greater importance is the Bundesbank’s public advocacy of monetary union actually becoming a permanent stability union  as is provided for in the Maastricht Treaty and is quite obviously desired by the majority of the population. Although there are occasionally slight differences of emphasis on individual points  there is complete unanimity within the Central Bank Council concerning the goal itself. Monetary union must become a permanent stability union with a strong currency  not least in order to prevent political conflict which might otherwise pose a risk at a later date. The Bundesbank is at one in favouring the creation of the economic and political preconditions which will ensure that the monetary stability gained through the D-Mark is likewise permanently maintained following the changeover to the euro. It has the authority to do this not only by virtue of the consensus on non-inflationary growth prevailing in Germany  it is also under a statutory obligation to do so. In accordance with article 3 of the Bundesbank Act it has the legal mandate of “safeguarding the currency”. Moreover  in accordance with article 12 it “is required to support the general economic policy of the Federal Cabinet”  but only without prejudice to the performance of its primary duty to “safeguard the currency”. The Act explicitly states that the Bundesbank is independent of instructions from the Federal Cabinet in exercising its powers. Priority of internal stability However  the legal wording “to safeguard the currency” does not seem to be totally unambiguous with regard to the question of internal monetary stability having priority over exchange rate stability. At the time this law was drafted in 1957  when the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates was still in force worldwide  internal and external exchange rate stability was virtually free of conflict. It was not until tensions emerged between the major industrial countries  as a result of domestic policy decisions and priorities drifting apart  that the subject of protecting internal stability policy against external constraints (as it was later called by Karl Schiller) became a matter of key importance. As the sixties progressed  the Bundesbank in Germany  with the vigorous support of the Federal Economics Ministers Ludwig Erhard and BIS Review 141/1996 - 3 - Karl Schiller  committed itself more and more unequivocally to the priority of internal monetary stability. And that has remained the case to the present day  with far-reaching agreement between the Federal Government and the Bundesbank. The Maastricht Treaty even adopted the priority of internal stability expressis verbis  in fact. Maintaining price stability has been enshrined in article 105 as the primary objective of the European System of Central Banks. The Bundesbank’s primary orientation towards internal price stability is hence fully consistent with the regulations which will apply one day to the European Central Bank. The Bundesbank has to fulfil its stability mandate  as defined above  in several ways. Its first and most crucial task is to conduct its own monetary policy in line with its anti-inflationary stance. It does have to play its part in achieving the other targets of the Stability and Growth Act (high level of employment  external equilibrium and stable and adequate economic growth)  but only to the extent that this does not jeopardise its primary goal of price stability. Since there is a large measure of consensus among economists that price stability is not -- at least in the medium term -- inconsistent with the other targets of the so-called uneasy quadrangle  but is  instead  a prerequisite for continued growth  high employment and external equilibrium  there should not actually be any conflict in this respect. An anti-inflationary monetary policy also serves other macroeconomic goals  the example of Germany providing ample evidence of this. Although a stable currency alone cannot automatically bring about and safeguard sustained growth and increased employment  it is an indispensable precondition for them. Furthermore  experience has shown that monetary stability also makes a major contribution to social equity. Given the demographic trends  not only in Germany but also in other European countries  this will be all the more the case in the future  since private provisioning by the “ordinary citizens” will become increasingly important. Role as a guardian of monetary stability In the final analysis  however  monetary stability cannot be safeguarded by an anti-inflationary monetary policy alone. It will always be influenced by the prevailing behavioural patterns in society and by developments in other policy areas. This applies  in particular  to those decisions taken in fiscal policy  labour market policy  social policy and wage policy which affect the viability of the economic and social system. Long-term undesirable trends in those areas also tend to jeopardise monetary stability in the short or long run  and then often require monetary policy countermeasures. For that reason  the Bundesbank’s role as a guardian of monetary stability must of necessity extend beyond its decision-making powers in monetary policy. It has to draw attention -- at as early a stage as possible -- to potential risks to stability in other areas and parallel behavioural patterns in the economy or in society. The Bundesbank has always made every possible effort to do this  without interfering in the political discussion of specific details. The Bundesbank is also especially suited to this more far-reaching function as a guardian of stability on account of the fact that the legislature has kept it largely free of day-to-day political influence and special party and lobby interests by virtue of its being independent of political instructions and by the long-term appointment of the members of its governing bodies. Being free of short-term party and special interests  the Bundesbank is hence able to raise its warning voice -- which it has always done in the almost forty years of its existence -- if it perceives the emergence of national or international risks to monetary stability. However  the political independence of the Bundesbank by no means implies that it is free of responsibilities. In contrast to many other countries  it is not -- for well considered BIS Review 141/1996 - 4 - reasons -- accountable to the government or to parliament. Nevertheless  from the very beginning it has placed itself under the obligation publicly to explain and justify its policy as well as its assessment of developments that are relevant to monetary policy. Its target group is the general public which it addresses through the speeches of the members of its governing bodies and its diverse publications  especially its Monthly and Annual Reports. The Bundesbank uses all these opportunities to explain its policy and the reasons behind its decisions. It hence puts itself before the forum of public discussion. Role of a monetary policy adviser ... Furthermore  the Bundesbank has been assigned a specific advisory role vis-à-vis the Federal Cabinet by the legislature. In accordance with article 13  the Bundesbank has to “advise the Federal Cabinet on monetary policy matters of major importance”. This advisory role has often been quite significant in the history of the Bundesbank. It not only played a considerable part in all the discussions on the design and application of the international and European monetary system. At the request of the Federal Cabinet  the Bundesbank also advised it in connection with preparing for German monetary union. Naturally  the political bodies were and remain free to follow the advice given by the Bundesbank or not. In fulfilling its political responsibilities  the Federal Cabinet departed from the Bundesbank’s recommendations on individual points (e.g. in the selection of the conversion rate for current payments). ... in the Maastricht negotiations ... The Bundesbank also performed its advisory function in connection with the negotiations on the Maastricht Treaty. As long ago as September 1990  the Central Bank Council drew attention to what it deemed to be the key issues in a memorandum. It said  among other things  “... the participating economies (i.e. in the monetary union) will be inextricably linked to one another in the monetary field  come what may. The implications of this -- especially for the value of money -- will depend crucially on economic and fiscal policy and on the stance of management and labour in all member states.” And then the indispensable benchmarks of a successful stability union are spelled out in detail: from an independent central banking system  with a priority commitment to the target of price stability  via the regulations for lasting budgetary discipline  to the requirements for sufficient and durable policy convergence among the participating countries prior to entry into the final stage. In addition  Bundesbank representatives  through their work on the EU Monetary Committee in Brussels and on the erstwhile Committee of Central Bank Governors in Basle  contributed to the wording of the Maastricht Treaty in numerous instances. For example  the statute of the European Central Bank was drafted largely by representatives of European central banks in Basle and then adopted  virtually unchanged  by government representatives in the Treaty negotiations. Parallel to the negotiations in Brussels and Maastricht  there were of course also repeated bilateral talks between the Bundesbank and the Federal Government on major aspects of the Treaty. These intensive and close contacts were and are fully in line with the Bundesbank’s statutory mandate to proffer advice. Equally  attention should be drawn to the fact that this does not affect the Government’s political accountability. It was not and is not the BIS Review 141/1996 - 5 - Bundesbank that conducted or conducts negotiations itself on these subjects. Incidentally  neither was it the Bundesbank that was responsible for the numerical fixing of the so-called fiscal criteria at 3 % of GDP for the current budget deficit and at 60 % of GDP for the fiscal debt level. To my knowledge  both figures  which in the eyes of the Bundesbank tend to be too generous  rather than too strict  for most countries  were put forward by delegations other than the German one. In the joint estimation of the Central Bank Council  however  it is imperative that  prior to entry into monetary union  “the budget deficits in all the participating countries should be reduced to a level which is sustainable in the long run and unproblematic in terms of anti-inflation policy requirements”. After the conclusion of the Treaty negotiations  the Central Bank Council published the following evaluation of the Treaty early in 1992: “The question of whether EMU is to be established is a political decision. ... The planned institutional design of the final stage is largely in line with the Bundesbank’s recommendations. In particular  the statute of the future European System of Central Banks ... It will be of paramount importance for the overall success of the envisaged economic and monetary union that the Community decisions to be taken in ... 1998 on the selection of the countries eligible for participation should be geared solely to their stability policy performance.” ... in the preparations for EMU In line with its statutory mandate  the Bundesbank is also advising the Federal Government in the current negotiations on the preparation of monetary union. That applies particularly to the consultations on the legal texts for what is known as the “secondary legislation” now taking shape in Brussels. And it also applies to the proposal for a European stability pact (which was put forward by the Federal Government and backed by the Bundesbank) to concretise the surveillance process for budgetary and debt trends in the participating countries envisaged in article 104c of the Treaty. That stability pact has nothing to do with any German desire for hegemony. Instead  it is intended to prevent potential conflicts from arising between the future single stability-oriented monetary policy and fiscal policy (especially the fiscal policies of the major member states)  thus protecting the smaller member states  in particular  from hardships imposed by the potential misconduct of the larger ones. Urging “strict” compliance with the contractual convergence criteria in the selection decision by the European Council on the member states participating in the monetary union beginning in 1999 -- as reflected in the evaluation of the Treaty published early in 1992 -- is  after all  part of the Bundesbank’s function of being a guardian of price stability and advisor. The calls made by the Bundesbank -- incidentally  in complete agreement with the Federal Government -- for a “strict” interpretation of the criteria laid down in the Treaty are by no means merely legalistic. Just like the Bundestag and the Bundesrat  the Bundesbank regards strict and lasting compliance with the convergence criteria as an essential precondition for the smooth inception and  as far as possible  conflict-free continuation of monetary union. Lasting convergence indispensable References to the fact that today there is not infrequently divergence  rather than convergence  within existing monetary areas disregard the fundamental difference that obtains between a monetary area that is identical to the borders of a nation state and a monetary union  which comprises several nation states with a different regulatory and social systems. After all  in BIS Review 141/1996 - 6 - a monetary union extending beyond the frontiers of a single nation state  the common features and compensatory systems which regularly exist within a nation state (such as a common legal and tax system  a dominant central government budget  common social security systems and fiscal adjustment mechanisms) are missing. Hence in a monetary union composed of several member states without superordinate national ties  the potentially diverging forces are far greater than in a nation state. It would be a fallacy to suppose that a common central banking system alone can prevent potential divergencies in a union comprising several major member states. This is why a monetary union encompassing several nation states entails from the outset a high level of common “stability culture”  in the sense of joint preferences and tried-and-tested capabilities. The degree of lasting convergence achieved and the readiness to maintain lasting financial discipline are intended to document precisely that. Disregarding the significance of the selection criteria and lastingly failing to acknowledge it would imply a lack of strategic perceptiveness  and not vice versa. A monetary union which later turned out to be particularly conflict-prone  let alone fragile  would not only pose economic problems  it might even turn out to be a serious threat to the European integration process. Drawing attention to these far-reaching political dangers  and thus to the crucial importance of selecting countries in keeping with the criteria  is undoubtedly part and parcel of the Bundesbank’s advisory mandate. After all  the monetary union must not be allowed to fail  let alone to become a source of political conflict in Europe. Not a “state within the state” All in all  the Bundesbank has constantly endeavoured to perform its role of being a guardian and advisor in keeping with its stability target  as laid down by Parliament -- and it will continue to do so. In the basic orientation of its policy it knows at the same time that it enjoys a consensus with the vast majority of the population. The performance of these duties by the Bundesbank  like its monetary policy  which is geared primarily to domestic price stability  has nothing to do with any stance as a “state within the state”. Nor does it have anything to do with a desire for German hegemony in Europe. Quite the contrary  a lastingly sustainable foundation and an anti-inflationary orientation of the monetary union are without any doubt in the best interests of Europe  too. It may well be that such a stability-oriented guardian and advisor function does not always fit in with the political and tactical aspirations of the political decision-makers. That may even be true at times of our trading partners. But Chancellor Kohl rightly said publicly not long ago: “As the Federal Chancellor  I sometimes have problems with individual measures or statements by the Bundesbank. But as a citizen of this country  I am happy that the Bundesbank exists and that it acts in this way. Of course  neither the Bundesbank nor its President can claim always to take the right action in all circumstances”. On taking office in 1993 I said: “Even the Bundesbank is not faultless”. Needless to say  that is just as true today  and will remain so in future. But the fact that the Bundesbank is attested a substantial measure of “credibility in anti-inflation policy” in Germany  in Europe and in international circles alike has certainly done Germany and Europe as a whole more good than harm. That verdict has been confirmed time and again by impartial observers. Hence the Bundesbank will also continue to feel itself committed to stability in the period ahead. BIS Review 141/1996

I. Introduction I am greatly honored to have been invited by the Research Institute of Japan to address this distinguished audience. Today  I would first like to discuss the Bank of Japan’s views on recent economic developments in Japan and the thinking behind the Bank’s current monetary policy. Then  I would like to review some of the basic issues related to monetary policy management  such as the significance of price stability  which is the objective of monetary policy  and the points for consideration in achieving it. There has been much debate since the beginning of this year about Japan’s central bank system  and the Central Bank Study Group  an advisory panel to the Prime Minister  is planning to publish a report in the near future. I myself have  on several occasions  addressed the basic issues involved  such as the status of the central bank within the framework of a democratic society  and the role of the central bank in maintaining financial system stability.1 As my previous speeches focused on the institutional framework of central banking  there has not been an opportunity to discuss the Bank of Japan’s views on the central bank’s policy management. I have thus selected monetary policy as the theme of today’s speech. However  there is another reason. Over the past decade  it seems that a new thinking has been developing among the industrialized countries regarding monetary and fiscal policy management  or more broadly  the economic policy management of a country. This has prompted heated discussions in various countries in recent years on monetary policy and central banking  and this new thinking will be of great significance in contemplating the future framework of the Japanese economy. I would therefore like to examine the role of monetary policy  bearing in mind this new thinking on economic policy management. II. Domestic Economic Conditions and Current Monetary Policy A. Domestic Economic Conditions I would like to begin by reviewing domestic economic conditions. In spring 1995  the recovery of the Japanese economy came to a pause and  at one time  there were even concerns about a deflationary spiral. In view of these economic developments  substantial monetary easing and large-scale fiscal policy measures were implemented. Since the beginning of this year  the economy has once again been on a recovery path  owing to the permeation of policy effects and the depreciation of the yen. The Bank currently judges that a moderate economic recovery continues  but there are concerns as to why the economy has not shown a recovery that is any stronger than “moderate” for nearly a year. This slow recovery can be explained by the tug-of-war between the forces encouraging recovery and the structural adjustment pressures constraining recovery. Therefore  1For details  see previous speeches entitled ""The role of the Central Bank"" and ""Recent Monetary and Economic Conditions and Issues facing the Japanese Financial System""  given on 14/06/96 and 03/04/96  respectively. Both speeches are included in the August 1996 issue of the Bank of Japan Quarterly Bulletin. BIS Review 142/1996 - 2 - to predict future economic developments  we must first understand how these two factors are at work in the economy. One of the forces encouraging recovery is the permeation of policy effects. For example  there is no doubt that the decline in interest rates has been contributing significantly to the recovery in housing and business fixed investments. At the same time  fiscal expenditures have underpinned domestic aggregate demand. However  forces encouraging economic recovery are not limited to the supporting policy measures. As the economy follows a recovery path supported by policy effects  a larger number of firms with improving profits have begun to show a more positive stance toward business fixed investment and employment. As a result  the risk of a deflationary spiral  which was an issue of concern last year  has been practically eliminated. It can thus be said that the cyclical forces of the economy based on domestic private demand have been slowly but steadily at work for the past year. However  the factors that constrain economic recovery have also been persistent. For example  while business fixed investment continues to recover owing to progress in capital stock adjustment  it has not yet gained the full momentum seen in past economic recoveries. This is because firms  in spite of improved profits  have given priority to repaying debts in order to improve their balance sheets  or have limited their gross fixed investment to the amount of cash flow generated from depreciation of existing facilities. Intensified competition with other Asian countries  which has brought changes to the international environment  is also affecting the Japanese economy in various ways. The inflow of low-priced goods from other Asian countries  for example  seriously affects firms producing competing products. Furthermore  the relocation of production bases overseas by Japanese manufacturers not only decreases domestic business fixed investment by those manufacturers  but also restrains the investment by their domestic subcontractors  due to decrease in orders. It seems that management of firms have not been able to dispel uncertainties over the future  as the path toward a new industrial structure remains obscure under the current circumstances. B. Structural Adjustment Pressures The Japanese economy is thus faced with two types of adjustment pressures: pressures for balance-sheet adjustment in the corporate sector; and pressures for structural adjustment of the industries created by the intensifying competition with other Asian countries. These are the factors that have caused the pace of economic recovery to remain moderate. These two adjustment pressures are  however  significantly different in nature. Adjustment of balance sheets is about reducing debts which accumulated during the “bubble” period  in other words  disposing of the burdens from the past. To that extent  this adjustment is regrettably of a negative nature. In order to reduce the burdens  it will be necessary to enhance the functions of the capital markets to strengthen firms’ capital bases  and to revitalize the real estate market to facilitate the liquidation of firms’ real estate holdings. Ultimately  however  it is only increase in profits that provides the funds necessary to write off latent losses on real estate and repay accumulated loans. In other words  the burdens from the past need to be reduced gradually with each year’s income arising from economic activity. In this regard  although it may sound paradoxical  revitalizing economic activity and boosting corporate profits  or more fundamentally  supporting the recovery of the economy will be important preconditions for the smooth progress of balance-sheet adjustment. Realizing a recovery of the economy encumbered with impaired balance sheets  therefore  requires a stronger policy support than otherwise. This is one of the reasons why the Bank has implemented substantial monetary easing measures to date. BIS Review 142/1996 - 3 - As a result  the economy has resumed recovery  although moderate  and corporate profits have been increasing. Accordingly  balance sheets have also been improving gradually. Regarding debt servicing ability  the ratio of firms’ long-term debts to cash flow has been declining slowly for the past two years  after rising rapidly during the “bubble” period. It can be said that firms’ balance sheets have  in general  begun to show steady improvement  although differences remain between individual sectors and firms. While the balance-sheet adjustment is an attempt to recover from a negative situation  structural adjustment of the industries in response to a new global economic environment is essentially a positive challenge in that the restructuring process itself introduces the possibility of creating renewed economic development. The increasing supply capacity of other East Asian economies and their transition to market economies have intensified competition facing Japan’s labor-intensive sectors. At the same time  however  these factors have expanded markets and business opportunities for the Japanese economy. Therefore  if the Japanese economy can adapt itself successfully to this new international division of labor  these developments should bring significant benefits to the Japanese economy in the long run. In fact  a careful look at the Japanese economy will reveal indications of such positive industrial restructuring. The change in Japan’s trade structure is one example. Until a decade ago  the top five imports were mostly fuels and raw materials  usually crude oil  wood  petroleum products  coal  and natural gas  although the order varied from year to year. In 1995  however  while crude oil maintained its top position  the other four major imports were office machinery  electronic parts  automobiles  and wood. The share of manufactured goods in Japan’s total imports has doubled from 30 to 60 percent over the decade. This change by itself would merely suggest that the manufacturing sector  which had long been Japan’s mainstay  now faces severer competition with imported goods. What is notable is that the composition of exports has also changed significantly during the same period. Automobiles  ships  and household electric appliances such as television sets and radios used to appear at the top of the list of export items. In 1995  however  while automobiles stayed as the number one import  electronic parts  office machinery  automobile parts  and scientific and optical apparatus ranked second to fifth  indicating that capital goods and parts have replaced consumer durables. As labor-intensive sectors such as the consumer durables industry grow in other East Asian economies  exports of labor-intensive products from Japan have been declining  while those of capital-intensive products with higher value added  such as capital goods and related parts  have been increasing. This is a typical illustration of the Japanese economy’s strong ability to adapt to changes in the global environment. The emergence and expansion of new leading industries in Japan are also indications of industrial restructuring. The mobile telecommunications market  for example  has grown rapidly to a ¥3.5 trillion market and the business fixed investment of this industry has expanded to almost ¥2 trillion  which is equivalent to the sum of business fixed investment by the automobile and iron-and-steel industries. Furthermore  in these three years when economic recovery has been unable to obtain a firm footing  some industries achieved earnings growth comparable to or even exceeding that attained in the three years during the economic boom of the latter half of the 1980s: namely  the electrical and precision machinery industries  which have succeeded in adjusting to the new international division of labor; and the pulp and paper industry in the raw materials sector  which has been able to benefit from the increased volume of information processed and distributed in today’s technological age. I have so far emphasized the brighter side of the domestic economy with the hope of further encouraging the efforts of domestic industries  but reality is obviously not so simple. During periods of transition of industrial structure  the contrast between the bright and dark sides tends to become stronger. Focusing on the dark side  the mismatch between labor BIS Review 142/1996 - 4 - supply and demand has become greater  and restructuring burdens have been particularly heavy on small and medium-sized firms. Looking back at the postwar period  the Japanese economy successfully underwent several major changes in the industrial structure and shifts in leading industries. There is no doubt that during the periods of transition  management of firms faced great uncertainties about the future  and that it was extremely difficult to accurately predict which would be the growth industries in the coming years. However  during the era of high economic growth  the rapid expansion of the economy absorbed the negative impact arising from the structural adjustment of the industries. The main difficulty that the current economy faces seems to lie not in the industrial restructuring itself  but in the fact that the current economic growth is not strong enough to provide a similar “shock absorber” effect. For this reason the implementation of structural policy  such as deregulation  has become an urgent issue. In order to promote industrial restructuring  it is necessary to create new investment opportunities and to encourage unrestricted and creative business activity through deregulation. It is also important to increase labor mobility and facilitate land transactions. C. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Management In order for the Japanese economy to be put firmly on a self-sustaining recovery path in the face of reduced fiscal support  it will be necessary for the structural adjustment to continue to progress and for the virtuous circle between production  income  and expenditure to gain further strength. In this respect  firms have been responding steadily to the structural adjustment pressures. The decline in net exports  which had been a drag on economic recovery  has been slowing recently. In addition  inventory adjustment  which has been under way in certain sectors since this spring  has virtually been completed in the iron-and steel-industry. In light of these facts  it is most likely that production will be further revitalized  strengthening the virtuous circle of the economy led by expanded private demand. However  this remains to be seen. In view of this economic situation  the Bank will continue  in the management of current monetary policy  to monitor monetary and economic developments closely  placing emphasis on further strengthening the foundation for an economic recovery. And to repeat my earlier point  it is also important to carry out structural reforms including drastic deregulation. In this respect  I hope that the new administration will continue to exercise strong leadership. III. New Thinking on Economic Policy Management The industrialized countries today attach more importance to structural policies  such as the strengthening of the competitiveness of domestic industries and the improvement of market infrastructure. In addition  these countries are making steady efforts to promote fiscal consolidation  to reform their central bank systems  and more broadly  to review national economic policy management and its framework. This common trend among the industrialized countries is closely related to the recent changes in the global economy. The collapse of the former socialist bloc  for example  demonstrated the superiority of a market economy over a government-controlled economy: that is  the superiority of a decentralized economy over a centrally-planned economy. In addition  the transition to a market economy and the progress of industrialization of these former socialist countries and the developing Asian countries have stimulated the industrialized countries to strengthen the competitiveness of their economies. BIS Review 142/1996 - 5 - Furthermore  past experiences of economic fluctuations  such as inflation and the asset-price “bubble”  and the concurrent accumulation of budget deficits have prompted countries to closely re-examine fundamental thinking on economic policy and the underlying economic theories. This year happens to be the 50th year since the death of John Maynard Keynes. There have recently been renewed discussions on the evaluating of Keynes’ theories and Keynesian economics  which in many respects formed the basis of postwar economic policies. The approaches currently adopted by various countries in addressing economic policies have several points in common. The first point is the growing emphasis placed on improving the supply side of the economy. The conventional approach to economic policy emphasizes the control of aggregate demand through monetary and fiscal policies  and this remains dominant when seeking short-term adjustments of the economy. At the same time  however  there is a growing perception that the driving force of long-term economic growth owes much to firms’ efforts to improve their productivity. It is thus necessary to strengthen the supply side of the economy by promoting the introduction of new technology and by improving infrastructures such as transportation and telecommunications. In fiscal policy management  greater importance is being attached to the details of fiscal expenditures from the viewpoint of evaluating the contribution of each portion to the improvement of economic infrastructures  rather than to their effects in generating additional demand. There is also a stronger awareness that  in the medium to long term  it is more desirable to curtail inefficient fiscal expenditures thereby reducing budget deficits and to utilize economic resources more efficiently in the private sector. All this reflects the growing emphasis on the supply side of the economy. The second point in common in the approaches to addressing economic policies is the emphasis placed on the utilization of the market mechanism. Related to the first point  it can be said that this emphasis calls for fully utilizing the inherent forces of the market mechanism of promoting greater economic efficiency and of inducing technological innovation  in order to achieve higher productivity. The global trend toward deregulation and promotion of market competition obviously originates in this common thinking. The effectiveness of the market mechanism is not limited to revitalization of industries and improvement of financial markets. For example  in Europe  there is a growing understanding that the main cause of the high unemployment rate  which has persisted for some time  is the lack of mobility in the labor markets. The solution to the problem  therefore  is considered to lie in facilitating the mobility in the labor markets so as to efficiently adjust labor market conditions. The third common element is the growing emphasis placed on the public’s expectations regarding future developments and its confidence in economic policies. For example  the effectiveness of fiscal policy depends significantly on the public’s views on the controllability of the fiscal deficits in the future. In the European countries and the United States  there is a growing perception that doubts about a government’s ability to control budget deficits could bring about an unfavorable rise in long-term interest rates. This is one of the major reasons why fiscal consolidation is considered to be an important task. It has also become clear that changes in expectations regarding price and interest rate developments significantly influence the effectiveness of monetary policy. There is a theory which even suggests that discretionary economic policy would not have any effect if people always had rational expectations about the future. While this may be an extreme example  in general it has come to be considered that the efficacy of economic policy cannot be discussed without taking into account its effects on people’s expectations. These recent changes in the thinking on economic policy naturally have a close bearing on the fundamental thinking about central banking and monetary policy management. BIS Review 142/1996 - 6 - For example  even when implementing short-term demand management policy  it is necessary to ensure that the policy is compatible with the objective of price stability -- the medium to long-term objective of monetary policy and a precondition for the smooth functioning of the market mechanism. It is also necessary to ensure that the public’s confidence in monetary policy be strengthened by clearly establishing the independence and accountability of the central bank. Bearing these points in mind  I would now like to move on to the other theme of today’s speech  the fundamental issues concerning monetary policy management. IV. The Basic Thinking on Monetary Policy Management A. Price Stability and the Central Bank Most people agree that the objective of monetary policy is the maintenance of price stability. I would like to explain why it is that this particular economic policy objective  among others  is assigned to monetary policy. Price stability  in this context  is not necessarily the stability of prices of individual goods and services  in other words  the stability of relative prices of individual items. In fact  fluctuation of relative prices in response to changes in the supply and demand conditions reflects the most basic principle of the market mechanism. Central banks aim at achieving the stability of prices in general by taking the prices of individual items in their totality. If prices in general increase  that is  if inflation occurs  the amount of goods that can be purchased for ¥10 000 will decrease  which means that the value of ¥10 000 will decline. It can thus be said that “prices in general” is another way of expressing “currency value”. The maintenance of price stability naturally becomes one of the most important missions of the central bank as the issuer of the currency  together with the mission of maintaining the stability of the financial system. Moreover  in the long run  it is the monetary policy of the central bank that is able to most effectively achieve stability of prices in general. It is true that prices  in the short term  fluctuate due to various factors: overseas market prices  such as crude oil prices; or the supply and demand conditions of particular goods. However  from a longer-term perspective  prices in general are determined by the amount of money relative to the amount of traded goods and services. For this reason inflation is often said to be a monetary phenomenon  and the task of achieving price stability is necessarily assigned to monetary policy. This then explains why the monetary policy of the central bank is so vital and why the central bank is called the guardian of the currency. There is a question of how asset prices  such as land prices and stock prices  may be considered in the management of monetary policy. The Bank believes that it is unsuitable to consider asset prices in the same way as it does the prices of ordinary goods and services. For example  land is not produced by everyday economic activity. In addition  land prices are determined in part by the perception of earnings that will be generated from the land  in other words  by the projection of economic activity and prices. Asset prices are therefore different in nature from the prices of goods and services that are produced daily through economic activity and consumed. It is also apparent  however  from the bitter experiences of the “bubble” economy that major fluctuations in asset prices are related to large swings in the economy. Therefore  the Bank believes that in order to ensure price stability in the medium to long term  due attention must be paid to asset-price developments. Later  I would like to discuss in more detail the meaning of price stability in the medium to long term. BIS Review 142/1996 B. The Significance of Price Stability - 7 - Let me now consider the significance of price stability. It seems self-evident that inflation and deflation are not desirable. As large fluctuations in prices are usually accompanied by economic overheating or recession  the stabilization of prices will lead to a stable economy. Furthermore  price fluctuations lead to an uneven distribution of income and assets  thereby threatening the stability of people’s everyday lives. In addition to the above  I would like to stress that the stability of prices in general is the most important precondition for the smooth functioning of the market mechanism. The market mechanism adjusts production and demand according to the signals sent by the changes in relative prices. Once inflation or deflation occurs  it becomes extremely difficult to read the signals received from the changes in individual prices  and as a result  the price mechanism ceases to function properly. This is because it becomes impossible to distinguish whether changes in individual prices reflect shifts in relative prices or in prices in general. It is as if there is no reliable yardstick for economic activity. Under such circumstances  firms trying to formulate future business plans based on their estimation of profitability of investments  and households making plans for savings and consumption face growing uncertainties  and this impedes economic development. In the past  some argued that inflation is desirable to a certain extent in order to further stimulate economic growth  or that firms’ activities would become more vigorous under inflation. The 50 years of postwar experience and the evolution of economic theories  however  have forced serious reconsideration of this argument. There is every likelihood that a mild inflation will eventually lead to full-scale inflation. In addition  once inflation takes root  the achievements of business activity are masked by nominal increases in profits  and accordingly  technological innovation and improvement in productivity are likely to be discouraged. Actual examples demonstrate that  from a longer-term perspective  countries with stable prices tend to enjoy higher economic growth. For these reasons  the current emphasis is on the significance of price stability  which is in line with the global trend in economic policy management placing stronger emphasis on the supply side of the economy and on the utilization of the market mechanism. C. The Meaning of Price Stability and Assessment Criteria How can price stability be defined? This remains a difficult question as it is not easy to draw a line between acceptable and an unacceptable rate of price increase. In theory  zero inflation would be desirable. If prices are to be the yardstick for economic activity  zero inflation allows the yardstick to be reliable and unchanging  and in addition avoids the adverse effects of price fluctuations on income distribution. I said that this is true “in theory” for several reasons. First  there are limitations to the accuracy of price statistics in that it is difficult to exclude price increases arising from improvements in product quality or to reflect changes in the market share of products. As the statistics become biased due to such technical limitations  some argue that it is undesirable to aim at zero inflation based on a specific price indicator. In addition  if there is a downward rigidity in certain prices and wages due to business practices and contractual constraints  the cost of achieving zero inflation could become substantial. In view of the significance of price stability as discussed earlier  a more practical criterion would be the sustainability of price stability in the medium to long term. This is because prices serve as a yardstick not only for deciding current production and consumption  but also for deciding the activities that lead to future economic developments  such as business fixed investment and savings. The perception that prices influence future BIS Review 142/1996 - 8 - developments has led to an increasing tendency to view price stability as being the state in which firms and households need not consider prospective price fluctuations in their economic decision-making. Even when price indexes remain stable during a certain period  price stability in the medium to long term could be at risk if the economy is overheating and creating potential upward pressures on prices. Monetary policy must thus be managed not only to minimize current fluctuations in prices  but also to contain the potential risk of price fluctuations in the future. This is why price stability is said to be a medium to long-term objective of monetary policy. The maintenance of price stability does not conflict with the achievement of stable economic growth and employment conditions. For example  measures to prevent overheating (or recession) of the economy can at the same time contain inflation (or avoid deflation)  and provide medium to long-term price stability; and this price stability  in turn  is a prerequisite for achieving sustainable growth of the economy  as I mentioned earlier. D. Features of Monetary Policy I would now like to examine the important elements in managing monetary policy. There are two features of monetary policy that differentiate it from other economic policies. The first feature is that monetary policy uses market-oriented measures to transmit policy effects to market participants and therefore the efficacy of monetary policy depends on the market’s reaction to the measures taken by the central bank. In this respect  monetary policy differs significantly in nature from the government’s economic policy  which aims to achieve its objectives through administrative means such as laws and regulations. Specifically  monetary policy affects the supply and demand of funds in the financial markets through the implementation of the Bank’s daily operations  such as bill and bond transactions. The mechanism is initiated in changes made to the money market interest rates  or in technical terms  changes to the overnight rates in the interbank market  which can be referred to as the wholesale market for cash and reserves. Changes in these rates affect other short-term interest rates and longer-term rates through arbitrage in the markets  which in turn influence changes in the deposit and lending rates offered by banks. These changes in interest rates as a whole then influence the economic activities of the corporate and household sectors. With the completion of the deregulation of interest rates  use of the market mechanism is currently the most effective way of transmitting policy effects throughout the financial markets and the economy. However  in order to effectively utilize this mechanism  public and market confidence in monetary policy is of decisive importance. Unless the policy intentions of the central bank are fully understood and considered to be credible  the effects of interest rate policies will not permeate adequately  and market interest rates may fluctuate independently of the intentions of the central bank  affected by unnecessary conjecture and rumors. The second distinct feature of monetary policy is that considerable time is required before its effects materialize  in other words  there is a long time lag before policy effects permeate throughout the economy. The mechanism through which changes in interest rates are transmitted to economic activity is complicated. Interest rate changes may have a relatively rapid influence on firms planning to make an investment in the near future. Theoretically  the effect of interest rate changes should be swiftly transmitted to fluctuations in asset prices. On the other hand  it takes a considerable time for the effects of interest rate changes to appear in actual corporate profits and household income levels. One reason is that BIS Review 142/1996 - 9 - there are various types of borrowing and investment with short and long maturities. As new interest rates are applied to these instruments only at the time of maturity  considerable time is required before the overall interest rate level changes and before the new level takes effect throughout the economy. In addition  changes in corporate profits and income levels will only bring about a gradual change in the confidence of firms and households in their investment and consumption  and after some delay in time  new decisions will be made on investment and consumption. Further time is then needed before these decisions materialize as actual spending. It has been said that pre-emptive policy responses are necessary to ensure price stability. This is because  as mentioned earlier  price stability must be achieved in the medium to long term  and because there will always be a considerable time lag before policy effects permeate throughout the economy. As this time lag in permeation of policy effects has become more widely recognized  greater emphasis has come to be placed in the management of monetary policy on assessing the potential risks in the economy  to enable pre-emptive policy responses. E. Considerations in Monetary Policy Management The requirements for monetary policy are thus “maintenance of market confidence” and “pre-emptive response”. It is  however  extremely difficult to achieve these two requirements simultaneously. Let me explain how the two requirements conflict. In order to make timely policy responses  it will be necessary for the central bank to act based on its projections of the economic and price situations one or two years ahead. However  considering the difficulty of accurately predicting economic developments  such action may not necessarily result in market confidence in the Bank’s policy. Nevertheless  it would be impossible to act pre-emptively if the Bank waited until a consensus was reached on future economic developments and desirable policy actions. It is no exaggeration to say that the key to monetary policy management is in finding how these two requirements can be fulfilled simultaneously. Central banks have tried to meet the two requirements through various techniques. For example  many central banks in the past adopted “money supply targeting”  in which monetary policy is aimed at achieving an intermediate target of money supply growth. This is a method based on the causality that fluctuations in money supply influence real economic activity with some time lag. However  it has been pointed out that financial innovations have made it difficult to discern the relationship between money supply and economic activity  and that although the relationship between the two is stable in the long term  it may be unsteady in the short term. Accordingly  many of the central banks which set a money supply target today mainly use it as a general guideline for monetary policy or refer to it as one of the major indicators in making policy decisions  rather than attempting to adhere rigidly to it. Some central banks now adopt “inflation targeting”  in which a certain target range is set for the inflation rate. This method aims to secure the confidence of the market by declaring beforehand the central bank’s commitment to a specific target. For those central banks employing inflation targeting  another challenge besides setting the target range is devising how to take appropriate  individual policy actions under the price target. Countries with high inflation rates have succeeded in containing these rates by employing inflation targeting. However  the fact that the method has been effective in curbing a high inflation rate does not necessarily indicate that it will also be effective in sustaining already stable prices. Recently  some academics in the United States have suggested evaluating the potential risks of price and economic fluctuations based on such concepts as the output gap and BIS Review 142/1996 - 10 - the expected inflation rate  and then utilizing these evaluations as guidelines in managing monetary policy. Unfortunately  it is difficult to establish rules or other convenient guidelines which are by themselves sufficient to ensure an optimal policy response. It is for this reason that the Bank of Japan has never adopted stringent targeting or specific rules to date  but instead has consistently emphasized the judgement of the overall economic conditions and has made efforts to improve underlying research and analytical skills. Learning from the bitter experiences of the emergence and the bursting of the “bubble” economy  the Bank attaches utmost importance to realizing price stability and thereby economic stability in the long run  and  to this end  identifying and assessing the potential risks within the economy. The Bank has also been making increased efforts to explain its actions and policy in detail in order to gain the better understanding of the public. One of the aims of last year’s series of monetary easing measures was to eliminate the possibility of a deflationary spiral  in other words  a potential risk of excessive price declines. The Bank also made efforts to provide a clearer explanation of the details of policies implemented and the thinking behind these policies. Announcements of the Bank’s stance on money market operations and improvements in the monthly and annual reports of the Policy Board are results of these efforts. The Bank intends to continue investigating ways of fulfilling simultaneously the two requirements of pre-emptive policy responses and of the maintenance of market confidence  by learning from theoretical and empirical studies and from the experiences of other central banks. I would like to emphasize that  in order to maintain market confidence in the central bank which is an essential task for achieving price stability in the medium to long term  the institutional independence of the central bank becomes very important. Accordingly  it will be necessary to enhance the transparency of policy decisions and to establish a framework to ensure the Bank’s accountability. V. Conclusion The review of the central bank system in Japan is likely to develop into a revision of the Bank of Japan Law after the Central Bank Study Group submits its report. When seen from the vantage point of reconsidering the broad framework of economic policy  I believe that the revision of the Bank of Japan Law is significant not only to the Bank of Japan itself or to the financial sector  but also to the overall economy. Now that Japan’s industries are making steady efforts to adapt to a new era  it is also required that the economic policy management of Japan be reformed to suit the times. The Bank of Japan Law is to be reviewed as the first concrete step in the reform process of Japan’s economic policy management. The law  stipulated in 1942  has been one of the rules and regulations constituting the basis of the old regime which has affected the country’s economic policy management for the past 50 years. This is why much international attention is now focused on the reform of the central bank system in Japan. In order for the central bank to achieve its missions  improvement of the institutional framework is necessary  but what is more important is that the Bank manages its policy and operations with due responsibility. We at the Bank are very conscious of this and will exert ourselves to the utmost to ensure that the Bank fulfills its responsibilities amid the ongoing globalization and shifts to market-oriented economies. I would like to conclude by expressing my hope for your continued support and understanding. BIS Review 142/1996"
r970107b,1997-01-07,https://www.bis.org/review/r970107b.pdf,Bank of Japan's December review of monetary and economic trends in Japan (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  20 Dec 96),BANK OF JAPAN  MONTHLY ECONOMIC REVIEW  20/12/96.,"Bank of Japan's December review of monetary and economic trends in Japan BANK OF JAPAN  MONTHLY ECONOMIC REVIEW  20/12/96. A moderate economic recovery continues in Japan  as private demand shows increasing firmness. With respect to final demand  public sector investment has peaked  but housing investment has remained at a high level because of low interest rates. The decline in net exports has paused. Business fixed investment is increasing steadily and a moderate increase also continues in personal consumption. Meanwhile  inventories on the whole are at appropriate levels. In these circumstances  industrial production growth is somewhat accelerating and corporate sentiment is improving gradually. Labor market conditions have improved on the whole  although the unemployment rate has remained at a high level. Meanwhile  the decline in prices is slowing gradually and monetary aggregates continue to grow at 3.0 - 4.0 per cent. With regard to personal consumption  growth in sales of electrical appliances has been high  particularly in personal computers and cellular phones  and passenger car sales (excluding compact cars) have recently increased significantly. Outlays for travel have remained firm and sales at department stores and supermarkets are increasing at a moderate pace. Among leading indicators of business fixed investment  machinery orders are increasing steadily albeit with some quarterly fluctuations. After the decline in the third quarter 1996  they are expected to increase significantly in the fourth quarter. Construction floor area has also picked up moderately. According to the Bank of Japan’s Tankan -- Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan of November 1996  business fixed investment plans of principal manufacturing firms for fiscal 1996 continued to increase at the same pace as those for fiscal 1995  while those of non-manufacturing firms turned to increase for the first time in five years. As a result  business fixed investment of principal firms overall is expected to expand at a faster pace than in fiscal 1995. Business fixed investment plans of small firms (all industries) were revised upwards substantially from the August Tankan  marginally exceeding the level of the previous year for the first time in five years. This shows that the recovery in business fixed investment is spreading across a wider spectrum of industries and corporate sizes. With respect to housing investment  housing starts have continued to grow reflecting low interest rates and reasonable housing prices. It recorded a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 1.82 million starts in October 1996  the highest level since November 1973  partly reflecting the increase in orders in September 1996 before the expected rise in the consumption tax. Regarding public-sector investment  the volume of public works contracted has  since spring 1996  stayed virtually unchanged from the level of the previous year as orders included in the economic policy package of September 1995 subsided. Public works activities such as shipments of related goods increased until summer 1996  reflecting time lags between the order and actual implementation of public works. Recently  however  they have also peaked out. Real exports have shown a moderate increase as the effects of the yen’s depreciation since summer 1995 have gradually become apparent after a time lag. Meanwhile  real imports have continued to rise  in part supported by structural elements  e.g.  the increased supply capacity of Asian economies. However  the tempo of increase has somewhat slowed  which also reflects the depreciation of the yen. Thus  both the real trade surplus and the nominal current account surplus declined rapidly until the first half of 1996 but have been rising since summer 1996. Industrial production increased steadily in the third quarter 1996 by an annual rate of about 6 per cent and also rose significantly in October. These increases reflect the progress in inventory adjustments and the continued increase in shipments of capital goods  which is closely related to business fixed investment. They also reflect higher growth in domestic sales and exports of passenger cars which have a large influence on production activities. Industrial production is expected to increase by an annual rate of about 10 per cent in the fourth quarter 1996 on the whole. BIS Review 142/1996 - 2 - The Tankan of November 1996 shows that the corporate profits of principal firms in both the manufacturing (excluding petroleum refining) and non-manufacturing sectors are forecast to continue increasing in fiscal 1996. Profit levels have risen particularly for manufacturing firms; the current profit-to-sales ratio is expected to reach over 4 per cent for the first time in five years. In these circumstances  business confidence of principal manufacturing firms improved moderately and is forecast to continue its upward trend. In the assembly industry in particular  the percentage differential between firms responding ""favorable"" and ""unfavorable"" has turned positive for the first time since February 1992. For non-manufacturing firms  business confidence has strengthened but it is forecast to weaken somewhat in the near future. On average  business confidence of non-manufacturing firms is on an upward trend. Small firms in both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors are expected to show continuing growth in profits in fiscal 1996. However  while business confidence of manufacturing firms continues to improve moderately  that of non-manufacturing firms remains virtually unchanged partly as a result of uncertainties about the outlook for public-sector investment. Labor market conditions have improved somewhat on the whole. Although the unemployment rate remains at a high level and employment growth is weak  overtime working hours have increased  and the ratio of job offers to job applications has continued its gradual rise. With respect to price developments  domestic wholesale prices (adjusted for seasonal electricity rates) seem to have stopped declining although downward pressures from competition with imports remain strong. This development was supported by the yen’s depreciation to date  the rise in crude oil prices and the improvement in domestic supply and demand conditions  particularly in construction-related goods. Corporate service prices have declined  particularly in rents and leasing charges  but the year-to-year decrease has become smaller. Consumer prices (nationwide  excluding perishables) have stayed slightly above the previous year’s level as commodity prices have continued to fall gradually and service prices have risen somewhat. Growth in monetary aggregates  measured in terms of the year-to-year growth rate of M2 +CDs average outstanding  has remained at 3.0 - 4.0 per cent  albeit with some fluctuations. Regarding money market rates  the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) on the whole has stayed below the official discount rate of 0.5 per cent. The 3-month CD rate has moved at around 0.5 per cent. Meanwhile  with regard to the market’s interest rate expectations  3-month Euro-yen futures declined at a somewhat brisk pace between the second half of July and autumn 1996  and have moved at around 0.7 - 0.9 per cent since September 1996. As the market’s expectations of higher interest rates receded  the long-term government bond yield has declined since mid-July 1996  and recorded a historical low of 2.34 per cent in early December. Recently  it has been moving at around 2.4 per cent. With respect to bank lending rates  the short-term prime lending rate has remained at a record low level of 1.625 per cent since September 1995. The long-term prime lending rate was lowered by a total of 0.8 percentage points in September  October  and December to reach a record low of 2.5 per cent  reflecting developments in long-term market rates. In these circumstances  short-term and long-term average contracted interest rates on new loans and discounts have moved at record low levels. On the stock exchange  the Nikkei 225 Stock Average had remained virtually unchanged since summer 1996 at around ¥20 000 - 21 000  varying across firms. Recently  however  it has weakened somewhat. In the foreign exchange market  the yen’s appreciation reversed its course and depreciated against the U.S. dollar between summer 1995 and autumn 1996. Since early 1996  the yen has continued to depreciate and has recently moved at around ¥114. Meanwhile  the yen depreciated temporarily against the deutsche mark in October and November 1996  and has recently moved at around ¥72 - 73. BIS Review 142/1996"

Meyer  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the AEA Panel on Monetary and Fiscal Policy held in New Orleans on 5/1/97. The Role for Structural Macroeconomic Models I am in the middle of my third interesting and active encounter with the development and/or use of macroeconometric models for forecasting and policy analysis. My journey began at MIT as a research assistant to Professors Franco Modigiliani and Albert Ando during the period of development of the MPS model  continued at Laurence H. Meyer & Associates with the development of The Washington University Macro Model under the direction of my partner  Joel Prakken  and the use of that model for both forecasting and policy analysis  and now has taken me to the Board of Governors where macro models have long played an important role in forecasting and policy analysis and the MPS model has recently been replaced by the FRB-US model. I bring to this panel a perspective shaped by both my earlier experience and my new responsibilities. I will focus my presentation on the role of structural macro models in the monetary policy process  compare the use of models at the Board with their use at Laurence H. Meyer & Associates  and discuss how the recently introduced innovations in the Federal Reserve model might further advance the usefulness of models in the monetary policy process. I. Structural Models and Monetary Policy Analysis I want to focus on three contributions of models to the monetary policy process: as an input to the forecast process; as a vehicle for analyzing alternative scenarios; and a vehicle for developing a strategy for implementing monetary policy that disciplines the juggling of multiple objectives and ensures a bridge from short-run policy to long-run objectives. 1. The forecast context for monetary policy decisions Because monetary policy has the ability to adjust quickly to changing economic conditions and because lags in the response to monetary policy make it important that monetary policy be forward-looking  monetary policy is very much influenced both by incoming data and by forecasts of spending and price developments. Forecasts are central to monetary policy setting. Models make a valuable contribution to forecasting. Therefore  models can make an important contribution to the setting of monetary policy. Models capture historical regularities  identify key assumptions that must be made to condition the forecast  embody estimates of the effects of past and future policy actions on the economy  and provide a disciplined approach to learning from past errors. I attribute much of the forecasting success of myself and my partners at LHM&A to the way in which we allowed our model to discipline our judgment in making the forecast. A model also helps to defend and communicate the forecast  by providing a coherent story that ties together the details of the forecast. It also helps to isolate the source of disagreements about the forecast  helping to separate differences in assumptions (oil prices  fiscal policy  etc.) from disagreements about the structure of the economy or judgments about special factors that the model may not fully capture. BIS Review 1/1997 - 2 - At the Board  the staff forecast  presented in the Green Book prior to each of the eight FOMC meetings each year  is fundamentally judgmental. It is developed by a team of sector specialists who consult  but are not bound by  a number of structural econometric equations describing their sectors  and further armed  in some cases  with reduced-form equations and atheoretical time series models. The team develops the forecast within the context of agreed-upon conditioning assumptions  including  for example  a path for short-term interest rates  fiscal policy  oil prices  and foreign economic policies. They begin with an income constraint and then participate in an interactive process of revisions to ensure that the aggregation of sector forecasts is consistent with the evolving forecast for the overall level of output. Models play an important supporting role in the development of the staff forecast. A separate model group uses a formal structural macroeconometric model  the FRB-US Model  to make a “pure model” forecast which is also available to the FOMC and is an input to the judgmental forecast process. The model forecast is conditioned by the same set of assumptions as the judgmental forecast and statistical models are used to generate the path of adjustment factors  avoiding any role for judgment in the forecast. The members of the model group also actively participate in the discussions as the judgmental forecast evolves  focusing in particular on the consistency between the adjustment factors that would be required to impose the judgmental forecast on the model and the pattern of adjustment factors in the “pure” model forecast. There are two important differences from the private sector use of models for forecasting  at least based on my experience at LHM&A. First  the staff is not truly making a forecast of economic activity  prices  etc.  because the staff forecast is usually conditioned on an unchanged path of the funds rate. Thus the staff is projecting how the economy would evolve if there were no change in the federal funds rate (which does not even always translate cleanly into no change in monetary policy). The rationale for this procedure is to separate the forecast process from the policy-making process  and therefore avoid appearing to prejudge the FOMC’s decisions. This procedure may be modified when there is a strong presumption that conditions will unambiguously call for significant action if the Committee is to achieve its objectives. But it does  nevertheless  make the forecast process at the Board fundamentally different from that in the private sector where one of the key decisions in the forecast is the direction of monetary policy. It is ironic that  at the Board  where the staff is presumably more knowledgeable about the direction of policy than in the private sector  forecasting is constrained from using that information in developing the forecast. On the other hand  the practice at the Board may be very well suited to the process of making policy by forcing the FOMC to confront the implications of maintaining an unchanged path for the funds rate. A second difference relative to my experience in the private sector has to do with the way in which judgment and model interact in the development of the forecast. My first impression of the process at the Board was that the judgmental team made its forecast without a model and the model team made its forecast without judgment  leaving the blending of model and judgment to be worked out in the process of discussion and iteration as the judgmental group looks at the model output and the model group joins the discussion of the forecast. The process is  I have come to appreciate  more complicated and subtle than this caricature. For example  when there have been important shocks (e.g.  unexpected rise in oil prices or an increase in the minimum wage)  model simulations of the effect of the shocks will provide a point of departure for the initial judgmental forecast. But it is  nevertheless  a different way of combining model and judgment than we used at LHM&A where the model played a more central role in the forecast process. An advantage of the Board’s approach is that it makes the BIS Review 1/1997 - 3 - forecast less dependent on a single model (perhaps desirable given the diversity of views on the FOMC) and forces recognition of uncertainties in the outlook when alternative sector models yield very different forecasts. 2. Policy alternatives and alternative scenarios to support FOMC policy decisions A second valuable contribution of models is to provide alternative scenarios around a base forecast. I will focus on three examples of this use of models at the Board  though there is also  of course  widespread use of alternative model-based scenario analysis in the private sector. First  the staff regularly provides alternative forecasts roughly corresponding to the policy options that will be considered at the upcoming FOMC meeting. The staff first imposes the judgmental forecast on the FRB-US model and then uses the model to provide alternative scenarios for a policy of rising rates and a policy of declining rates  bracketing the staff forecast which assumes an unchanged federal funds rate. While this is the most direct use of the model in the forecast process  it is recognized that it has become a problematical one  especially given the structure of the new FRB-US model that otherwise treats policy as determined by a rule  a prerequisite to the forward-looking approach to expectations formation that is a major innovation in the new model. Indeed  it might well be that the presentation of a forecast that incorporates a simple monetary policy rule might be a more useful complement to the staff’s judgmental forecast than the mechanical bracketing of the judgmental forecast with pre-determined paths of rising or falling rates. Second  the staff  on occasion  uses the model to provide information about the projected effects of significant contingencies: e.g.  the return of Iraq to oil exporting under the U.N. agreement for humanitarian aid or the effect of an increase in the minimum wage. Models are particularly well suited to providing this information. Third  the model can be used to evaluate the consistency of alternative policies with the Federal Reserve’s long-run objective of price stability. One of the challenges of monetary policy making is to ensure that the meeting-to-meeting policy deliberations maintain a disciplined focus on the Federal Reserve’s long-term price stability objective. To facilitate this focus  five-year simulations under alternative policy assumptions are generally run semi-annually  to coincide with the FOMC meetings preceding the preparation of the Humphrey-Hawkins report and the Chairman’s testimony on monetary policy before Congress. These simulations have recently focused on policy options allowing for more gradual or more rapid convergence over time to long-run inflation targets  allowing the FOMC to focus on both the different time-paths to achieve the long-run objective and the alternative paths of output and employment during the transition to the long-run target. 3. Policy rules to inform discretionary monetary policy A third contribution of models to the monetary policy process is through simulations with alternative rules for Federal Reserve action. At LHM&A we designed our model to offer users four policy regimes: setting paths for the money supply  nonborrowed reserves or the federal funds rate or turning on a reaction function according to which the federal funds rate responds to developments in output  unemployment and inflation. While we increasingly used the reaction function in our analysis of alternative fiscal policies  we did not routinely take advantage of the reaction function to forecast monetary policy. Another irony is that there is a much more active interest in the implications of monetary policy rules at the BIS Review 1/1997 - 4 - Board  where discretionary policy is made  than in the private sector  where estimated rules might be effectively used to forecast monetary policy. The staff has examined a number of alternative rules  including those based on monetary aggregates  commodity prices  exchange rates  nominal income  and  most recently  Taylor-type rules. These rules  in effect  adjust the real federal funds rate relative to some long-run equilibrium level in response to the gaps between actual and potential output and between inflation and some long-run inflation target. Such a rule can be interpreted as either a descriptive or normative guide to policy. If the parameters of the policy rule are estimated over some recent sample period  the rule may describe the average response of the FOMC over the period. Alternatively  parameters can be derived from some optimizing framework  dependent on a specific objective function and model of the economy. Stochastic simulations with such a rule can provide some confidence that following the rule will contribute to both short-run stabilization and long-term inflation goals in response to historical shocks to the economy and the rule  in turn  can provide discipline to discretionary policy by providing guidance on when and how aggressively to move interest rates in response to movements in output and inflation. The focus on rules is much more important under an interest rate operating procedure than under an operating procedure focused directly on monetary aggregate targets and is also more important under an interest rate operating procedure when the monetary aggregates  as has been the case for some time  do not bear a stable relationship to overall economic performance and therefore do not provide useful information about when and how aggressively to change interest rates. Taylor-type rules  in this environment  provide a disciplined approach to varying interest rates in response to economic developments that both ensures a pro-cyclical response of interest rates to demand shocks and imposes a nominal anchor in much the same way as would be the case under a monetary aggregate strategy with a stable money demand function. For this reason  I like to refer to the strategy implicit in such rules as “monetarism without money.” This should not suggest that we can write a rule that is appropriate  in all circumstances  to all varieties of shocks  and to all the varieties of cyclical experience. Rules  at best  can discipline judgment rather than replace judgment. A particular problem with Taylor-type rules is that we do not know the equilibrium real federal funds rate and  whatever it might be at one point in time  it likely varies over time. There is considerable research under way at the Board in an effort to find specifications and parameters for rules which achieve an efficient balancing of inflation and output variability and provide guidance about patterns and aggressiveness of interest rate adjustments consistent with the stabilizing properties of high-performing rules. II. The FRB-US Model: Rational Expectations in a Sticky-Price Model The newly redesigned model at the Board  the FRB-US model  replaces the MPS model. The MPS model  developed in the mid to late-1960s  revolutionized macroeconometric modeling and set the standard for a considerable period of time. The Board participated in the development of the MPS model and then became its home and the Board staff kept the faith alive during the lean years when such models lost respectability in academic circles  even as their usefulness and value in forecasting and practical policy analysis was growing in the “real” world. The FRB-US model retains much of the underlying structure in terms of equilibrium BIS Review 1/1997 - 5 - relationships and even more of the fundamental simulation properties of the MPS model  but significantly modernizes the estimation of the model and the treatment of expectations. The vision in the new work is to separate macro-dynamics into adjustment cost and expectations formation components  with adjustment costs imposing a degree of inertia and expectations introducing a forward-looking element into the dynamics. The net result is a structure that integrates rational expectations into a sticky-price model. In this respect  the new model follows closely the approach pioneered by John Taylor. Finally  the estimation technique makes use of co-integration and an error-correction framework. Financial and exchange rate relationships are based on arbitrage equations  with no adjustment costs but with explicitly forward-looking expectations. The specification of nonfinancial equations  in contrast  incorporates both adjustment costs and rational expectations. Rational expectations are implemented in two alternative ways. First  expectations can be specified as “model-consistent” expectations; that is  the expectations about future inflation can be set to equal future inflation (perfect foresight) through iterative solutions of the model. Model-consistent expectations may  but need not  assume that the private sector has complete knowledge of the policy rule being followed by the Federal Reserve. In the second approach  expectations are also viewed as being model-consistent  but in this case the model relevant to expectations is not precisely the same as the FRB-US model. Instead  expectations are formed based on a simpler VAR model of the economy. The VAR model always includes three variables -- the output gap  a short-term interest rate  and inflation. When expectations of additional sector-specific variables are required  the system is expanded to include the additional variable. A unique aspect of the VAR expectations is that these equations also incorporate explicit forward-looking information through an error-correction specification. For example  the VAR equations include a term for the gap between actual inflation and the public’s “long-run” expectations of inflation  based on survey measures of long-run inflation expectations which  in turn  might be viewed as based on a combination of the public’s perception of the Federal Reserve’s reaction function  including its tolerance of inflation over the long run. The equations also include the gap between actual short-term interest rates and the public’s long-run expectations of short-term rates  gleaned from the yield curve. The model retains the neo-Classical synthesis vision of the MPS model -- short-run output dynamics based on sticky prices and long-run Classical properties associated with price flexibility -- and therefore produces multiplier results  both in the short and longer runs  that are very similar to those produced by the MPS model. The result is that the model produces  for the most part  what may be the best of two worlds – a modern form and traditional results! But the better articulated role of expectations in the new model also allows a richer analysis of the response to those policy actions which might have immediate impacts on inflation and/or interest rate expectations. The model has several advantages. The first is it may be more credible to a wider audience because of its modernization in terms of cointegration and error-learning specification on the one hand and explicit use of rational expectations on the other hand. Second  the model is much more flexible in terms of research potential. It allows one to study in particular how the response to monetary or fiscal policies depends on features of the expectation formation process. Third  the model forces the user to make assumptions explicitly about expectations formation that otherwise could be avoided or hidden. BIS Review 1/1997 - 6 - Let me give two examples of policy options that can be analyzed more effectively in the new model. First  consider a deficit reduction package that is credible and promises to lower interest rates in the future. In models like MPS and WUMM  the mechanical fiscal policy simulation would ignore any “bond market effect” associated with changed expectations about future short-term rates. One could  of course  add-factor downward the long-term bond rate in the term structure equation to impose a bond market effect  but the structure of the model neither immediately points you in this direction nor provides any guidance about how to intervene. In FRB-US  in contrast  one cannot avoid making an explicit assumption about the credibility of such a policy (through assumptions about future short-term interest rates in the VAR expectations or in the context of model-consistent expectations) and the assumption made about credibility will importantly affect the short-run dynamics though not the long-run effects of the policy. Second  consider the transitional costs of reducing inflation. The transitional effects on output depend importantly on the assumptions made about the credibility of the inflation commitment. Note  however  that there are significant transitional output costs of disinflation even under full credibility and the model-consistent specification of rational expectations  arising from the sticky price implication of the adjustment cost specification. For my part  I prefer the FRB-US simulations based on limited rather than perfect credibility  because I do not believe that credibility effects significantly diminish the transition costs of lowering inflation. But I also value having a disciplined approach to showing how the costs of disinflation would vary with the differing degrees of credibility. References Brayton  F.  A. Levin  R. Tryon  and J.

Rivlin  at the The Brookings Institution National Issues Forum in Washington on 19/12/96.,Ms. Rivlin discusses the prudential regulation of banks and how to improve it Remarks by the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  Ms. Alice M. Rivlin  at the The Brookings Institution National Issues Forum in Washington on 19/12/96. I discovered when I joined the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System about six months ago that most of my friends -- including my sophisticated public policy oriented friends -- had only a hazy notion what their central bank did. Many of them said  enthusiastically  “Congratulations!” Then they asked with a bit of embarrassment  “Is it a full-time job?” or “What will you find to do between meetings?” The meetings they were aware of  of course  were those of the Federal Open Market Committee. They knew that the FOMC meets every six weeks or so to “set interest rates.” That sounds like real power  so the FOMC gets a lot of press attention even when  as happened again this week  we meet and decide to do absolutely nothing at all. The group gathered here today  however  realizes that monetary policy  while important  is not actually very time-consuming. If you cared enough to come to this conference  you also have a strong conviction that the health and vigor of the American economy depends not only on good macro-economic policy  although that certainly helps  but also on the safety  soundness and efficiency of the banking system. We need a banking system that works well and one in which citizens and businesses  foreign and domestic  have high and well placed confidence. So I want to talk today  as seems appropriate on the fifth anniversary of FDICIA  about the subject that occupies much of our attention at the Federal Reserve: the prudential regulation of banks and how to improve it. Indeed  I want to focus today  not so much on what Congress needs to do to ensure the safety and soundness of the bank system in this rapidly changing world -- there are others on the program to take on that task -- but more narrowly on how bank regulators should go about their jobs of supervising bank risk-taking. The evolving search for policies that would guarantee a safe  sound and efficient banking system has featured learning from experience. In the 1930s  Americans learned  expensively  about the hazards of not having a safety net in a crisis that almost wiped out the banking system. In the 1980s  they learned a lot about the hazards of having a safety net  especially about the moral hazard associated with deposit insurance. Deposit insurance  which had seemed so benign and so successful in building confidence and preventing runs on banks  suddenly revealed its downside for all to see. Some insured institutions  mostly thrifts  but also savings banks  and not a few commercial banks  were taking on risks with a “heads I win  tails you lose” attitude -- sometimes collecting on high stakes bets but often leaving deposit insurance funds to pick up the pieces. At the same time  some regulators  especially the old FSLIC  which was notably strapped for funds  were compounding the problem -- and greatly increasing the ultimate cost of its resolution -- by engaging in regulatory “forbearance” when faced with technically insolvent institutions. The lessons were costly  but Americans do learn from their mistakes. The advocates of banking reform  many of them participants in this conference  saw the problems posed by moral hazard in the context of ineffectual supervision and set out to design a better system. BIS Review 1/1997 - 2 - Essentially  the reform agenda had two main components: * First  expanded powers for depository institutions that would permit them to diversify in ways that might reduce risks and improve operating efficiency; * Second  improving the effectiveness of regulation and supervision by instructing regulators  in effect  to act more like the market itself when conducting prudential regulation. FDICIA was a first step toward meeting the second challenge -- how to make regulators act more like the market. It called for a reduction in the potential for regulatory “forbearance” by laying down the conditions under which conservatorship and receivership should be initiated. It called for supervisory sanctions based on measurable performance (in particular  the Prompt Corrective Action provisions that based supervisory action on a bank’s risk-based capital ratio). The Act required the FDIC and RTC to resolve failed institutions on a least-cost basis. In other words  the Act required the depository receivers to act as if the insurance funds were private insurers  rather than continue the past policy of protecting uninsured depositors and other bank creditors. Finally  FDICIA placed limitations on the doctrine of “Too Big To Fail ” by requiring agency consensus and administration concurrence in order to prop up any large  failing bank. In a few places  however  FDICIA went too far. The provisions of the Act that dealt with micro management by regulators were immediately seen to be “over the top ” and were later repealed. The Act provided a framework for regulators to invoke market-like discipline. It left room for them to move their own regulatory techniques in this direction -- a subject to which I will return in a minute. The other objective of reform -- diversification of bank activities through an expansion of bank powers -- has not yet resulted in legislation and is still very much an on-going debate. In part  this failure to take legislative action reflected the long-running ability of the nonbank competition to use its political muscle to forestall increased powers for banks. But the inaction on expanded powers also reflected a Congressional concern that additional powers might be used to take on additional risk  which  on the heels of the banking collapse of the late 1980s  represented poor timing  to say the least. There was also some Congressional disposition to punish “greedy bankers ” who were seen as the reason for the collapse and the diversion of taxpayer funds to pay for thrift insolvencies. Whatever the reasons  not only did the 102nd Congress fail to enact expanded bank powers  but so did the next two Congresses. We are hopeful that the 105th Congress will succeed where its predecessors have failed. Meanwhile  the regulatory agencies have acted to expand bank powers within the limits of existing law. The Federal Reserve has proposed both liberalization of Section 20 activities and expedited procedures for processing applications under Regulation Y. The OCC has acted to liberalize banks’ insurance agency powers and  most recently  to liberalize procedures for operating subsidiaries of national banks. Of course  I would have to turn in my Federal Reserve badge and give up my parking pass if I did not mention that we at the Fed believe that some activities are best carried out in a subsidiary of the holding company rather than a subsidiary of the bank. We believe that the more distance between the bank and its new  nonbank operations  the more likely that we can separate one from the other and avoid the spreading of the subsidy associated with the safety net. While the regulators can move in the right direction  it is still imperative that Congress act. Artificial barriers between and among various forms of financial activity are harmful to the best interests of the consumers of financial services  to the providers of those BIS Review 1/1997 - 3 - services  and to the general stability and well-being of our financial system  most broadly defined. Congress should consider this issue and take the next steps. Let me turn now to what I consider to be one of the most critical issues facing regulators  especially in a future in which financial markets likely will dictate significant further increases in the scope and complexity of banking activities. I am referring to the issue of how to conduct optimal supervision of banks. Fortunately  there appears actually to be an evolving consensus at least on the general principle. Regulators  including the Federal Reserve  strongly support the basic approach embodied in FDICIA; namely that regulators should place limits on depository institutions in such a way as to replicate  as closely as possible  the discipline that would be imposed by a marketplace consisting of informed participants and devoid of the moral hazard associated with the safety net. Unfortunately  as always  the devil is in the details. The difficult question is how should a regulator use “market-based” or “performance-based” measures in determining which  if any  supervisory sanctions or limits to place on a bank. FDICIA’s approach was straightforward. Supervisory sanctions under Prompt Corrective Action were to be based on the bank’s risk performance as measured by its levels of regulatory capital  in particular its leverage ratio and total risk-based capital ratio under the Basle capital standards. These standards now seem well-intended but rather outdated. Certainly  the Basle capital standards did the job for which they were designed  namely stopping the secular decline in bank capital levels that  by the late 1980s  threatened general safety and soundness. But the scope and complexity of banking activities has proceeded apace during the last two decades or so  and standard capital measures  at least for our very largest and most complex organizations  are no longer adequate measures on which to base supervisory action for several reasons: * The regulatory capital standards apportion capital only for credit risk and  most recently  for market risk of trading activities. Interest rate risk is dealt with subjectively  and other forms of risk  including operating risk  are not treated within the standards. * Also  the capital standards are  despite the appellation “risk-based ” very much a “one-size-fits-all” rule. For example  all non-mortgage loans to corporations and households receive the same arbitrary 8 percent capital requirement. A secured loan to a triple-A rated company receives the same treatment as an unsecured loan to a junk-rated company. In other words  the capital standards don’t measure credit risk although they represent a crude proxy for such risk within broad categories of banking assets. * Finally  the capital standards give insufficient consideration to hedging or mitigating risk through the use of credit derivatives or effective portfolio diversification. These shortcomings of the regulatory capital standards were beginning to be understood even as they were being implemented  but no consistent  consensus technology existed at that time for invoking a more sophisticated standard than the Basle norms. To be sure  more sophisticated standards were being used by bank supervisors  during the examination process  to determine the adequacy of capital at any individual institution. These supervisory determinations of capital adequacy on a bank-by-bank basis  reflected in the CAMEL ratings given to banks and the BOPEC ratings given to bank holding companies  are much more inclusive than the Basle standards. Research shows that CAMEL ratings are much better predictors of bank insolvency than “risk-based” capital ratios. But  a bank-by-bank supervision  of course  is not the same thing as the writing of regulations that apply to all banks. BIS Review 1/1997 - 4 - It is now evident that the simple regulatory capital standards that apply to all banks can be quite misleading. Nominally high regulatory capital ratios -- even risk-based capital ratios that are 50 or 100 percent higher than the minimums -- are no longer indicators of bank soundness. Meanwhile  however  some of our largest and most sophisticated banks have been getting ahead of the regulators and doing the two things one must do in order to properly manage risk and determine capital adequacy. First  they are statistically quantifying risk by estimating the shape of loss probability distributions associated with their risk positions. These quantitative measures of risk are calculated by asset type  by product line  and  in some cases  even down to the individual customer level. Second  the more sophisticated banks are calculating economic capital  or “risk capital ” to be allocated to each asset  each line of business  and even to each customer  in order to determine risk-adjusted profitability of each type of bank activity. In making these risk capital allocations  banks are defining and meeting internal corporate standards for safety and soundness. For example  a banker might desire to achieve at least a single-A rating on his own corporate debt. He sees that  over history  single-A debt has a default probability of less than one-tenth of one percent over a one year time horizon. So the banker sets an internal corporate goal to allocate enough capital so that the probability of losses exceeding capital is less than 0.1 percent. In the language of statistics  this means that allocated capital must “cover” 99.9 percent of the estimated loss probability distribution. Once the banker estimates risk and allocates capital to that risk  the internal capital allocations can be used in a variety of ways -- for example  in so-called RAROC or risk-adjusted return on capital models that measure the relative profitability of bank activities. If a particular bank product generates a return to allocated capital that is too low  the bank can seek to cut expenses  reprice the product  or focus its efforts on other  more profitable ventures. These profitability analyses  moreover  are conducted on an “apples-to-apples” basis  since the profitability of each business line is adjusted to reflect the riskiness of the business line. What these bankers have actually done themselves  in calculating these internal capital requirements  is something regulators have never done -- defined a bank soundness target. What regulator  for example  has said that he wants capital to be high enough to reduce to 0.1 percent the probability of insolvency? Regulators have said only that capital ratios should be no lower than some number (8 percent in the case of the Basle standards). But as we should all be aware  a high capital ratio  if it is accompanied by a highly risky portfolio composition  can result in a bank with a high probability of insolvency. The question should not be how high is the bank’s capital ratio  but how low is its failure probability. In sharp contrast to our 8 percent one-size-fits-all capital standard  the internal risk-capital calculations of banks result in a very wide range of capital allocations  even within a particular category of credit instrument. For example  for an unsecured commercial credit line  typical internal capital allocations might range from less than 1 percent for a triple-A or double-A rated obligor  to well over 20 percent for an obligor in one of the lowest rating categories. The range of internal capital allocations widens even more when we look at capital calculations for complex risk positions such as various forms of credit derivatives. This great diversity in economic capital allocations  as compared to regulatory capital allocations  creates at least two types of problem. * When the regulatory capital requirement is higher than the economic capital allocation  the bank must either engage in costly regulatory arbitrage to evade BIS Review 1/1997 - 5 - the regulatory requirement or change its portfolio  possibly leading to suboptimal resource allocation. * When the regulatory requirement is lower than the economic capital requirement  the bank may choose to hold capital above the regulatory requirement but below the economic requirement; in this case  the bank’s nominally high capital ratio may mask the true nature of its risk position. Measuring bank soundness and overall bank performance is becoming more critical as the risk activities of banks become more complex. This condition is especially evident in the various nontraditional activities of banks. In fact  “nontraditional” is no longer a very good adjective to describe much of what goes on at our larger institutions. Take asset securitization  for example. No longer do our largest banks simply take in deposit funds and lend out the money to borrowers. Currently  well over $200 billion in assets that  in times past  have resided on the books of banks  now are owned by remote securitization conduits sponsored by banks. Sponsorship of securitization  which is now almost solely a large bank phenomenon  holds the potential for completely transforming the traditional paradigm of “banking.” Now  loans are made directly by the conduits  or are made by the banks and then immediately sold to the conduits. To finance the origination or purchase of the loans  a conduit issues several classes of asset-backed securities collateralized by the loans. Most of the conduit’s debt is issued to investors who require that the senior securities be highly rated  generally double-A and triple-A. In order to achieve these ratings  the conduit obtains credit enhancements insulating the senior security holders from defaults on the underlying loans. Generally  it is the bank sponsor that provides these credit enhancements  which can be in the form of standby letters of credit to the conduit  or via the purchase of the most junior/subordinated securities issued by the conduit. In return for providing the credit protection  as well as the loan origination and servicing functions  the bank lays claim to all residual spreads between the yields on the loans and the interest and non-interest cost of the conduit’s securities  net of any loan losses. In other words  securitization results in banks taking on almost identically the same risks as if the loans were kept on the books of the bank the old-fashioned way. But while the credit risk of a securitized loan pool may be the same as the credit risk of holding that loan pool on the books  our capital standards do not always recognize this fact. For example  by supplying a standby letter of credit covering so-called “first-dollar” losses for the conduit  a bank might be able to reduce its regulatory capital requirement  for some of its activities  by 90 percent or more compared with what would be required if the bank held the loans directly on its own books. The question  of course  is whether the bank’s internal capital allocation systems recognize the similarity in risk between  on the one hand  owning the whole loans and  on the other hand  providing a credit enhancement to a securitization conduit. If the risk measurement and management systems of the bank are faulty  then holding a nominally high capital ratio -- say  10 percent -- is little consolation. In fact  nominally high capital ratios can be deceiving to market participants. If  for example  the bank’s balance sheet is less than transparent  potential investors or creditors  seeing the nominally high 10 percent capital  but not recognizing that the economic risk capital allocation should  in percentage terms  be much higher  could direct an inappropriately high level of scarce resources toward the bank. Credit derivatives are another example of the evolution. The bottom line is that  as we move into the 21st century  traditional notions of “capital adequacy” will become less useful in determining the safety and soundness of our largest  most sophisticated  banking organizations. This growing discrepancy is important because “performance-based” solutions BIS Review 1/1997 - 6 - likely will continue to be touted as the basis for expanded bank powers or reductions in burdensome regulation. For example  the Federal Reserve’s recent proposed liberalization of procedures for Regulation Y activities applies to banking companies that are “well-capitalized” and “well-managed.” Similarly  the OCC’s recent proposed liberalization of rules for bank operating subsidiaries applies to “well-capitalized” institutions. Also  industry participants continue to call for expanded powers and/or reduced regulatory burden based on “market tests” of good management and adequate capital. It will not be easy reaching consensus on how to measure bank soundness and overall bank performance. It cannot simply be done by observing market indicators. For example  we cannot easily use the public ratings of holding company debt. The ratings  after all  are achieved given the existence of the safety net. The ratings are biased  therefore  from the perspective of achieving our stated goal -- to impose prudential limits on banks as if there were no net. In addition  I am sure that there would be disagreement between market participants and regulators over what should be acceptable debt ratings. The solution may be for the regulators to use the analytical tools developed by the market participants themselves for risk and performance assessment. Regulators already have begun to move in this direction. For example  beginning in January 1998  qualifying large multinational banks will be able to use their internal Value-at-Risk models to help set capital requirements for the market risk inherent in their trading activities. The Federal Reserve is also conducting a pilot test of the pre-commitment approach to capital for market risk. In this approach  banks can choose their own capital allocations  but would be sanctioned heavily if cumulative trading losses during a quarter were to exceed their chosen capital allocations. These new and innovative methods for treating the age-old problem of capital adequacy are likely to be followed by an unending  evolutionary flow of improvements in the prudential supervisory process. As the industry makes technological advances in risk measurement  these advances will become imbedded in the supervisory process. For example  the banking agencies have announced programs to place an increased emphasis on banks’ internal risk measurement and management processes within the assessment of overall management quality -- that is  how well a bank employs modern technology to manage risk will be reflected in the “M” portion of the bank’s CAMEL rating. In a similar vein  now that VaR models are being used to assess regulatory capital for market risk  it is easy to envision that  down the road  banks’ internal credit risk models and associated internal capital allocations will also be used to help set regulatory capital requirements. Regulation and supervision  like industry practices themselves  are continually evolving processes. As supervisors  our goal must be to stay abreast of best practices  incorporate these practices into our own procedures where appropriate  and do so in a way that allows banks to remain sufficiently flexible and competitive. In conducting prudential regulation we should always remember that the optimal number of bank failures is not zero. Indeed  “market-based” performance means that some institutions  either through poor management choices  or just because of plain old bad luck  will fail. As regulators  we must carefully balance these market-like results with concerns over systemic risk. And  as regulators of banks  we must always remember that we do not operate in a vacuum -- the activities of nonbank financial institutions are also important to the general well-being of our financial system and the macro economy. Regulators  of course  can only work with the framework laid down by Congress. Let me conclude with the hope that this Congress will build on the experience of the last few years  including the experience with FDICIA  and take the next steps toward creating a structural and regulatory framework appropriate to the 21st century. BIS Review 1/1997
r970108c,1997-01-08,https://www.bis.org/review/r970108c.pdf,Mr. Davies gives his personal view of EMU (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  16 Dec 96),Speech by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England  Mr. Howard Davies  at the EFMA Conference on the Single Currency in Brussels on 16/12/96.,"Mr. Davies gives his personal view of EMU Speech by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England  Mr. Howard Davies  at the EFMA Conference on the Single Currency in Brussels on 16/12/96. Like many British men of my generation  I spent a good part of my spare time as a boy involved with the Scouting movement  first as a Wolf Cub  then as a Boy Scout. I have to confess that I have forgotten many of the useful things I learned in the Boy Scouts. I can no longer light a camp-fire using only two sticks. I can no longer tie a clove hitch. But I can remember the Boy Scout’s motto - ‘Be Prepared’. And that motto strikes me as a useful injunction to bear in mind  as we approach the D-Day for Economic and Monetary Union of 1 January 1999. It applies  I think  just as much to those who may  for one reason or another  find themselves outside the first group of EMU countries  as it does to those who firmly intend to surf on the first wave. The preparations  though  may be slightly different in each case. Now some of you may think  if you read the British press  or hear echoes of the British political debate on EMU through the media elsewhere in Europe  that in present circumstances one of the other pieces of advice which Lord Baden-Powell handed down to Boy Scouts who followed him would be more appropriate. I am thinking particularly of the injunction to smile and whistle through all difficulties. Certainly I am sometimes tempted  when asked to explain the state of opinion in London  to take refuge in a cheery smile  and to begin to whistle a mournful tune (not easy to do at the same time  you will find). Fortunately  it is not my responsibility to discuss the politics of EMU in the United Kingdom. Another good reason for me not to do so is that I would like to keep my job. As a humble central banker  a mere technician  it is more appropriate for me to focus on the economic dimension of EMU and to say something  also  about the financial market implications which concern us  particularly given the Bank of England’s position at the heart of the City of London. In both these areas - economic and financial - the Boy Scout motto is particularly apposite today. Let me explain why. At the Bank of England we have always held the view that Economic and Monetary Union is a momentous enterprise  with huge consequences for European economies. The act of irrevocably fixing exchange rates  between economies which have in many cases been managed separately for centuries  is not a step to be undertaken lightly. It is an exciting venture  almost too exciting for some  perhaps. Those who have operated for decades with a regime of low inflation  interest rates set by a strong independent central bank  and a strong and appreciating currency  may rightly think they have little to fear from the disciplines implied by EMU. Others will find EMU more bracing  particularly those whose inflation record has been poor  whose currency has undergone successive devaluations  and whose fiscal position is less than robust. For those countries  the EMU mission is potentially dangerous. Joining EMU would for them be to embark on a stiff mountain ascent  in weather which might be colder and less forgiving than one is used to. In those circumstances  the Boy Scout ensures that he is well prepared. He equips himself with waterproofs in the event of rain  with thick pullovers for the cold  with stout boots and  probably  a Swiss army knife in case it should prove necessary  at some point on the journey  to extract a stone from a horse’s hoof. He would also  I think  wish to ensure that he was fit  and had undertaken some strenuous rambles BIS Review 1/1997 - 2 - in the foothills before making an assault on the mountain range. At this point you may be tired of hearing about Boy Scouts  and be ready to accuse me of the typical British trick of hiding behind down-home metaphors  and reducing topics of high seriousness to wry jokes. So let me be entirely clear about what I mean. We fully appreciate the great potential advantages of EMU for Europe’s economies. The Chancellor of the Exchequer  Kenneth Clarke  described them in the House of Commons on Wednesday of last week. As he said then ""if EMU can be made to work it would eradicate exchange rate movements which can disrupt trade and have disrupted trade in our recent history. EMU would also reduce transaction costs  making it easier for smaller businesses to enter into and compete in the European market. The members of a strong euro zone could also expect to enjoy lower interest rates . . . countries with a history of devaluation or bursts of inflation pay a lasting premium in terms of higher interest rates  as we in Britain know only too well!"" And in his response to the debate Gordon Brown  the Shadow Chancellor  said that he was in principle in favour of a single currency for the United Kingdom. So the attractions of EMU are well understood in Britain. They were in the minds of the architects of the Maastricht Treaty five years ago. But those architects also knew that the advantages would only be accessible to those countries whose economies were equipped to accept the disciplines which go alongside. If that were not true  then the EU would have discovered the economic equivalent of alchemy. We are convinced that if a single currency is to be a success  then all the participants must be satisfied that they can survive within the EMU disciplines in the long term  as well as the short. This applies to the 1997 convergence criteria themselves  of course. It also applies to performance against those criteria in later years. And  in our view  perhaps more controversially  it applies to other aspects of the real economies of applicant countries  particularly to the structures of their labour markets. In the case of the convergence criteria  our attitude is straightforward. They must be rigorously respected. And that applies to the substance  as well as the form. So it would be unwise for a country to seek to qualify in 1998 by massaging down its 1997 public sector deficit through artificial  unrepeatable devices  even if those devices are not technically disallowed. It would be unwise  because the deficit limit is not a one-off requirement. Continued discipline on individual member states’ budget positions is a crucial element of EMU in the future. Friday’s agreement at Dublin provides for such discipline  albeit with an element of political judgement over the way that discipline will be exercised in certain circumstances. But the general conclusion is clear. Member states will need to live with continued fiscal discipline. In our view  unless a country can show that its fiscal position is structurally sound - in other words that in mid-cycle  with the economy growing at trend on its potential growth path  the budget of the government would tend to be close to balance - then it may find the fiscal discipline of EMU difficult to sustain. That is both a long-term point  and one relevant to the transition period. It would be potentially destabilising of the whole project if countries found themselves obliged to take extremely difficult political decisions in the early years because their fiscal positions had not been properly corrected beforehand. Of course it goes without saying that if a country’s outstanding debt burden is well above the Maastricht guideline it will be much more difficult to achieve a sustainable BIS Review 1/1997 - 3 - deficit position  since it will be necessary to run sizeable primary surpluses at high points in the cycle. It is worth recalling that when the Treaty set a figure of 60 per cent of GDP the EU average was 55 per cent. This year it will be over 73 per cent  and only Luxembourg  France and the UK will be below 60 per cent. Any country with a very large outstanding debt to GDP ratio will find the going particularly tough. As far as the UK is concerned  our debt to GDP ratio is relatively low at 56 per cent  but while we have made considerable progress towards fiscal consolidation in recent years  our deficit remains above the Maastricht guideline  even after almost five years of growth. A UK government of any political colour  as it comes to make a decision on our readiness for EMU membership next year  will be bound to take that into consideration. The latest government forecast  after the recent Budget  shows us achieving a figure of a touch below 3 per cent in calendar 1997. I could make similar points about the exchange rate criterion where  once again  we believe it is important to focus on the substance rather than on the form. Has a country shown that its anti-inflation discipline  over a lengthy period  has allowed its currency to hold its own without generating significant current account imbalances? For some applicant countries  the answer is evidently yes; for others  no. Once again  that is an issue which we will have to consider carefully as we assess the position of the United Kingdom next year. I imagine that these points would be very widely accepted across the EU  certainly by my central banking colleagues. But our view of the optimal state of preparedness for EMU is rather broader than this. And  here - as I said earlier - we may be less obviously in the mainstream of European opinion. Because we have concerns about the sustainability of an Economic and Monetary Union in which there is too little flexibility in product and labour markets  particularly the latter. Is the monetary union being designed one which retains sufficient flexibility to cope with the kind of differential shocks which may affect different countries within it? This point is  I think  not the same as asking whether the EU is an optimal currency area. I suspect the answer to that question would be no. But one might well give the same answer in relation to the United States  or even to the United Kingdom itself. The question is whether there is sufficient flexibility within the proposed currency union to cope with asymmetric shocks. We know that  in the United States  there is considerable fiscal flexibility  some through automatic stabilisers  like federally-funded welfare benefits  and some through direct transfer payments from prosperous to less prosperous states. We also know that there is considerable labour mobility in the United States  and that wages vary widely from region to region. In Europe  the central EU budget is very small  less than 1.5 per cent of European GDP  and there is no strong current of opinion in favour of expanding it significantly. It is also the case that labour mobility is low  for linguistic and cultural reasons  which cannot easily be overcome by government fiat. Now I would certainly not argue that an EMU could not be attempted without a huge central EU budget  or without teaching everyone commercial German. But we need to make sure that labour markets are as prepared as they can be for the future  a future in which there will be no possibility of the use of the exchange rate to cope with changes in competitiveness  from country to country  whether driven by supply-side shocks or by differential rates of productivity growth. Our concern is that  unless EMU is accompanied by BIS Review 1/1997 - 4 - measures to free up Europe’s labour markets  existing high rates of unemployment in disfavoured regions will be ossified  with unpredictable and possibly unpleasant social consequences in the long term. Looking at Europe’s regional economies  it is striking that relativities between them have remained so stubbornly large for so long  even within individual member states. Indeed only in the UK have there been some recent signs that relative unemployment rates  from prosperous to less prosperous regions  have begun to converge. That appears to be related in changes in relative wages which have come about as a result of the dismantling of centralised pay bargaining  and of other labour market restrictions  in the 1980s. Elsewhere in Europe those changes have not been made; without them we would have to enter a reserve on the preparedness of some European economies for the rigours of a single currency. That is another point which  I am sure  any British government will wish to take into account in making its final decision. And we would feel more comfortable about the likely success of EMU as a whole - and I emphasise that the success of EMU is strongly in the British national interest  whether we are in or out - were we to see faster progress towards greater labour market flexibility elsewhere in Europe. It may be argued that EMU itself will act as a stimulus to reforms needed in fiscal policy  and in labour markets; indeed that the prospect of EMU is already doing so. We - cautious  pragmatic  non-visionary people that we are - would like to see the needed reforms implemented first. These preparations  both in the financial and the real economies  are the preparations which prospective ‘ins’ need to make  in particular. But there are of course preparations in financial markets which apply to everyone. We are in no doubt that the introduction of the euro in 1999  if the current timetable is maintained  will have profound consequences for financial markets  initially for wholesale markets  and later for the retail financial sector too. It is incumbent on all central banks to seek to ensure that the financial markets in which they sit are as well prepared as they can be for this momentous change. We must also ensure that the central banks themselves are well prepared. At the Bank of England we now have a steering group  which I chair  focused on preparing the Bank itself. We have made a clear decision that the Bank will be ready for UK membership of EMU in January 1999  if a future government decides that that is the right course for the country. But our more important work in the short term is focused on preparing the City of London and on preparing the financial infrastructure which the City will need to maintain its position as the most innovative and dynamic financial market in Europe. I should emphasise that we see the City as a financial market for the whole of Europe  not just for the United Kingdom. That explains why we are always ready to welcome overseas financial institutions to London  why we rigorously avoid discrimination on grounds of nationality in our financial market dealings  and why we have greatly welcomed the decisions by German  French and Swiss banks in particular to concentrate many of their wholesale market activities in London in recent years. Europe needs a broad and deep market like London to rival those in Tokyo and New York. I would not wish  today  to talk at length about the preparations being made in the City for EMU. Partly because this afternoon  in London  we shall be releasing our latest quarterly report on Practical Issues Arising from the Introduction of the Euro  which sets out in some detail the progress that has been made over the last three months  and how we propose to take things forward. In short  we are confident that London will be as well prepared for EMU as BIS Review 1/1997 any market  when the time comes. - 5 - As we say in that paper  we are fully involved in preparing the wholesale financial sector of the economy for the euro and  of course  in the extensive work being undertaken at the European Monetary Institute. For the most part that work is proceeding successfully and we are happy with the decisions made. Some are  inevitably  compromises. But that is what building Europe is all about  and we are always ready to seek compromise solutions. We understand that to build one European wholesale financial market will require a staple diet of solid Bundesbank fare  seasoned with a soupçon of Banque de France  a ración of Banco de España  and so on  as well as a couple of pints of Bank of England pragmatism. There is one important area  I think  in which it has not so far been possible to reach an agreed solution  and one on which I might just conclude with one or two observations. That is the question of TARGET  the inter-linking of real time gross settlement systems across Europe. There are two issues of interest  here. First  pricing policy. We have argued that the pricing of the national element of cross-border payments should relate to national costs  rather than being set uniformly. So far we have not prevailed on that point and  as long as the competition authorities approve  it is likely that there will be a common price within the TARGET system for cross-border transactions. Unfortunately  some of our colleagues do not believe this is an area in which competition should intrude. The second important question relates to the terms on which ‘out’ central banks might link to TARGET in the future. We can see no reason why out central banks should not be able to link to TARGET on the same terms as those which apply to the ins. We accept  of course  the need in both in and out countries for rigorous policing to prevent unintended spill- over of intra-day credit into the overnight market. That policing can be achieved through penal interest rates. But we can see no monetary policy issue in relation to intra-day credit. The extension of sterling intra-day liquidity in our present domestic RTGS system is of no interest to  and never considered in the context of  monetary policy decisions. The same holds for all other countries. Indeed we could go further and say that denying even-handed access to TARGET through out central banks will negate one of the main purposes of the whole exercise  to reduce the risk inherent in systems in which banks are exposed to each other for a period of hours. Banks would find other ways round the restriction which would be more risky. So central banks across Europe will have scored an own goal. We shall need to look carefully at this issue as we move towards 1999. If restrictions were to be applied to out central banks which made TARGET unattractive to banks in London  thereby encouraging them to use less secure cross-border mechanisms for euro payments  then we shall need to think about the other options we could adopt. One possible option might be to develop our own euro RTGS arrangements to allow quick  efficient and safe euro payments within the UK which would not rely on access to intra-day credit from the euro area. We would prefer a pan-European solution which  we strongly believe  would be in the interests of the EU as a whole in the long run. But one thing is clear. Safe  efficient and competitive payment and settlement systems must be available in our own marketplace  and they will be. London has huge advantages as a strong and competitive financial centre in or out BIS Review 1/1997 - 6 - of EMU. We are confident that those advantages will remain. The fact that more and more banks are centring their foreign exchange  corporate finance and investment business in London suggests that they share our confidence in the future of London. In these matters it always seems to me to be best to take one’s cue from ‘revealed preferences’ - where financial institutions choose to base themselves  taking account of all the uncertainties. Those revealed preferences remain strongly in London’s favour. The preparations for EMU are now hotting up. All over Europe  Boy Scouts are packing their rucksacks with the kit they will need for this determined assault on what  in deference to its German roots  we should perhaps call the Magic Mountain  with apologies to Thomas Mann. The Magic Mountain is perhaps a more tactful title to choose than The Confessions of Felix Krull  Confidence Man  or Death in Venice  as some others in London might suggest. I hope that this morning I have given you some insights into what we think should be in the central banker’s rucksack  and how the United Kingdom will assess its own preparedness next year  when the time comes.

Trichet presents the monetary policy guidelines of the Bank of France for 1997 (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  17 Dec 96),BANK OF FRANCE  PRESS RELEASE  17/12/96.,M. Trichet presents the monetary policy guidelines of the Bank of France for 1997 BANK OF FRANCE  PRESS RELEASE  17/12/96. 1. The ultimate goal of monetary policy is to ensure price stability  as required by legislation. The objective of the Monetary Policy Council is that the increase in prices  as measured by the consumer price index  should not exceed 2% in 1997  as in the medium term. 2. To meet this ultimate goal  the Banque de France uses two intermediate objectives  one of which is external and the other internal: The objective of a stable external value of the currency: as it has been for ten years  the stability of the franc will be maintained against the group of the most credible currencies in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. An intermediate internal growth target for the money supply as assessed by the development of the narrow and broad monetary aggregates: in 1997  the money supply should be able to show a medium-term growth trend of 5%. This figure is consistent with price inflation of no more than 2% and non-inflationary real GDP growth of about 2.5%  which could be exceeded  in view of the potential for growth to catch up in the medium term. The Monetary Policy Council has decided to simultaneously monitor the main narrow and broad money aggregates in order to obtain a concise estimate of all monetary developments. 3. Total domestic debt is an important indicator. It helps the Banque de France make sure that the economy is supplied with enough financing to grow  and it enables us to track developments in financing for businesses  households and general government simultaneously. The Monetary Policy Council will keep a close eye on other indicators  including all leading indicators of changes in prices  such as capacity utilization rates  production costs  developments in incomes and commodity prices. The Monetary Policy Council will also monitor long-term interest rates and the current account balance. Before announcing the Council's monetary policy decisions for 1997  I would like to discuss the results achieved in 1996. 1. The 1996 results are in line with the targets we set. The ultimate monetary policy goal  which is price stability  was met. Businesses delayed passing on part of the August 1995 two-point increase in the standard rate of VAT until the beginning of 1996. The twelve-month rise in consumer prices was equal to and then above 2% during the first seven months of 1996  but subsequently fell back to 1.ó% in August and September  once the VAT effect had disappeared. The twelve-month increase stood at 1.5% to 1.ó% in November and the latest forecasts predict a price rise of close to 1.5% for the end of 1996. The twelve-month price increase thus resumed its pre-August 1995 trend and will be less than 2% at the end of 1996  in line with the objective set by the Monetary Policy Council. The objective of a stable external value of the French franc vis-à-vis the most credible currencies in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was met. BIS Review 2/1997 - 2 - Since the beginning of 1996  the franc has continued to move gradually closer to its central rates against the other currencies in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. This firmness of the franc has gone hand in hand with the continuing overall competitiveness of the French economy. The real effective exchange rate of the French franc has improved and exports  as in previous years  helped to boost activity. The seasonally-adjusted current account surplus for the first nine months of 1996 stood at almost FRF 84 billion. This was much greater than the FRF 64 billion surplus posted for the same period of 1995. On the basis of current forecasts  France will record the third largest current account surplus in the world for 1996. Growth in the M3 reference aggregate  which is the reference for our internal intermediate objective  showed a reversal in its trend. The expansion of M3 at the end of the third quarter of 1995 was close to its medium-term growth target path of 5%  but subsequently slowed sharply. The twelve-month increase of 4% in December 1995 gave way to a contraction of 0.4% in October 1996  the last month for which figures are available. This reversal in the growth of M3 was to a very great extent the result of a large-scale reallocation of investment flows stemming from the fall in short-term interest rates since autumn 1995  which has been of unprecedented magnitude and rapidity. The M3-M2 aggregate  which includes assets paying money market rates of interest  posted a twelve-month fall of 10.1 % at the end of October 1996. In response to the fall in short-term interest rates and also a heavier tax burden on money market mutual funds  economic agents reallocated their portfolios towards assets covered by the investment aggregates  and particularly the Pl aggregate covering contractual savings products  including housing saving plans. Year-on-year growth in P1 accelerated from 12.3% in December l995 to 18.5% in October 1996. The rate of interest paid on housing savings plans has remained unchanged at 5.25% since February 1994  whereas comparable market rates have fallen sharply. This gave a strong boost to the reallocation of investment flows. Year-on-year growth in housing savings plans accelerated significantly  rising from 14.1% at the end of 1995 to almost 26% in October 1996. In addition  twelve-month growth in the P2 aggregate covering investment in bonds and life insurance products remained buoyant. It stood at 12.3% in June 1996  with new investment accounting for 9%. At the same time  formation of liquidity was dynamic. The narrow money aggregates M1 and M2  which cover transaction balances and liquid savings  showed annual growth trends in October 1996 of around 5.8% and 7.5%  respectively. In particular  the growth of M2-M1  covering passbook savings deposits  accelerated from 7.6% in December 1995 to 9.6% in October 1996. In such a context  it is important to monitor closely the investments which  within the P investment aggregates  constitute fairly close substitutes for monetary assets in the strictest sense. M3 + P1 posted significant annual growth of around 4%. On the financing side  total domestic debt showed a yearly growth trend of around 3.3%. Total domestic debt incorporates the debt financing obtained by resident non-financial agents in the corporate  personal and public sectors  be it in the form of borrowing from credit institutions or debt issues on domestic or international markets  and is thus a valuable yardstick BIS Review 2/1997 - 3 - for analyzing the financing provided to the economy. Even though government debt continues to be the most dynamic component of total domestic debt  its twelve-month growth slowed sharply from 13.4% in December 1995 to ó.9% in September 1996. Outstanding lending by credit institutions to the private sector is practically stable  particularly owing to the corporate sector's sizeable cash surplus. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE)  the self-financing rate of companies and near-companies stood at around 114% in the second quarter of 1996. I shall now make a few comments concerning interest rates  which fell across the board in 1996. This decline in interest rates  which began in October 1995  corresponds to a considerable increase in confidence in the French franc and in the creditworthiness of France in connection with the policies set forth by the President of the Republic and the Government for the reduction of government deficits  the stability of the franc and Monetary Union in 1999. In 1996  the Banque de France's repurchase tender rate was cut from 4.45% to 3.2% today. It is one of the lowest rates in the G7 countries in both nominal and real terms. The five-to-ten-day repo rate fell from 5.85% to 4.75%. Short-term market rates eased substantially  with three-month rates shedding almost 400 basis points since October 1995 and currently standing at around 3.4%. The easing in short-term rates went hand in hand with a significant decline in long-term rates  which are the reference for a large share of lending to the private sector. Ten-year rates have fallen by more than 100 basis points since October 1995. Thanks to the credibility of every component of its economic policy  France today enjoys the lowest medium- and long-term market rates in the European Union  and the third lowest rates in the world  bettered only by Japan and Switzerland. This brings me to the monetary policy decisions for 1997. 1. The ultimate goal of monetary policy is to ensure price stability  as required by legislation. The objective of the Monetary Policy Council is that the increase in prices  as measured by the consumer price index  should not exceed 2% in 1997. as in the medium term. 2. To meet this ultimate goal  the Banque de France uses two intermediate objectives  one of which is external and the other internal: The objective of a stable external value of the currency: as it has been for ten years  the stability of the franc will be maintained against the group of the most credible currencies in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. An intermediate internal growth target for the money supply assessed by the development of the narrow and broad monetary aggregates: in 1997  the money supply should be able to show a medium-term growth trend of 5%. This figure is consistent with price inflation of no more than 2% and non-inflationary real GDP growth of about 2.5%  which could be exceeded  in view of the potential for growth to catch up in the medium term. The Monetary Policy Council has decided to simultaneously BIS Review 2/1997 - 4 - monitor the main narrow and broad money aggregates in order to obtain a concise estimate of all monetary developments. 3. Total domestic debt is an important indicator. It helps the Banque de France make sure that the economy is supplied with enough financing to grow  and it enables us to track developments in financing for businesses  households and general government simultaneously. The Monetary Policy Council will keep a close eye on other indicators  including all leading indicators of changes in prices  such as capacity utilization rates  production costs  developments in incomes and commodity prices. The Monetary Policy Council will also monitor long-term interest rates and the current account balance. These decisions call for two remarks. First  on a technical level  the Monetary Policy Council has decided to monitor several narrow and broad money aggregates simultaneously in order to obtain a concise estimate of all monetary developments. As we have seen  certain data  and particularly  but not exclusively  M3 data  have been severely disrupted recently by several factors  such as the very substantial fall in short-term rates and the ensuing large-scale reallocation of investment flows towards non-monetary assets  higher taxes on money market mutual funds  and the continuing very high level of interest paid on housing saving plans. We will therefore keep a very close eye on the M1  M2  M3  and M3+P1 aggregates as expressions of the underlying growth of the money supply. Particular attention will be paid to the growth of the M3+P1 aggregate covering monetary assets and contractual savings. A very large proportion of the outflows from M3 in the past year was directed towards investments covered by P1  and particularly housing savings plans with a residual maturity of one year or less. In fact  this type of investment at present constitutes a very close substitute for monetary assets. Second  the Monetary Policy Council has set monetary policy against the background of potential growth for the French economy of around 2.5% per year. We consider the average growth of our economy in the medium-term  and it could be exceeded given that we have a potential to catch up in the medium term. We reckoned with a maximum price increase of 2% and potential real growth of between 2.5% and 3% in the medium term to arrive at a figure of 5% for the medium-term growth trend of the money supply. BIS Review 2/1997 - 5 - It is very important to bear in mind the essence of the policy implemented by the Monetary Policy Council. Parliament confers on the Banque de France an objective  namely the objective of price stability. Maintaining the value of the currency preserves the purchasing power of the currency  and therefore that of French citizens. In addition  Parliament has sought to create the conditions for growth and for job creation  via the stability of the currency. This is also the goal of the Monetary Policy Council. To achieve this goal  we use two means. First  by preserving the value of the currency  we enhance its credibility in France  in Europe and in the world and allow our economy to benefit from financing at favourable market interest rates. It is very important for future French growth  for investment and for job creation that we have the lowest medium- and long-term market rates in the European Union today and the third lowest interest rates in the world. Second  price stability curbs cost increases in our productive sector. In doing so  the competitiveness of our economy—other things being equal—is preserved and enhanced. This is good for future French growth and for job creation. It is important to note that we currently have a dynamic export sector and  according to the latest forecasts for 1996  the third highest current account surplus in the world. One other indicator of competitiveness is encouraging  namely the flow of foreign direct investment into France. It stood at FRF 120 billion in 1995. The latest figures for the first nine months of 1996 show inward foreign direct investment totalling FRF 74 billion. In all  since the beginning of 1995  a total of FRF 194 billion  the equivalent of USD 39 billion  has been invested directly in France  making us the third-ranking industrialized economy in terms of inward foreign direct investment  behind the United States and the United Kingdom. Thus  when the Monetary Policy Council makes interest-rate decisions  it bears in mind first the objective of preserving the purchasing power of the currency  for and on behalf of all French people  and second  its corollary  namely the creation of monetary  financial and competitive conditions that will allow our economy to achieve its full potential for sound and sustained growth  for job creation and therefore for combating unemployment. Central Banks cannot “command” growth. Growth is the fruit of the labour of men and women  of the efficiency of employees  workers and engineers  of the imagination and skill of business leaders  and also  more broadly  of the influence of European and international business conditions. It is stimulated  in the medium and long term  by structural reforms that liberate initiative  strengthen the dynamism of the economy  combat unemployment effectively and encourage the creation of the greatest possible number of jobs for a given level of wealth and growth. However  it is up to Central Banks to create the best possible monetary and financial conditions  through the credibility and stability of the currency. These conditions now exist in our country and the Monetary Policy Council is convinced that the time has come for firms and households to invest. In many sectors and firms  the financing exists. The self-financing rate of the entire French productive sector is above 100% overall. Interest rates as a whole are at historic lows. The French economy has substantial BIS Review 2/1997 - 6 - potential for growth in the medium term. In the last three years  potential growth has averaged a little more than 2% a year for the years 1994  1995 and 1996. We can do better. We believe that our economy's potential non-inflationary growth is around 2.5% in the medium term  and this can be exceeded given the capacity for growth to catch up. The requirements for investment are financing terms  self-financing  competitiveness  and medium-term growth. We believe these requirements exist today. If I had to sum up briefly the message of the Monetary Policy Council  I would say: “The investment plans exist. The time has come today to implement them. Let us invest. It is the surest way for us to contribute to non-inflationary growth that creates jobs and thus to help in the fight against unemployment.” French monetary policy is in line with the European strategy of the President of the Republic and the Government  and therefore with the creation of an economic and monetary union on 1 January 1996. The advance towards the single currency was decisively confirmed at the European Summit in Dublin  where an agreement was reached on the legal status of the euro  on the new European Monetary System and on the stability and growth pact intended to guarantee fiscal discipline in the Monetary Union. The Banque de France's monetary policy contributes directly to our country's success in meeting three of the five criteria for entry into Monetary Union: the criterion of price stability  which is the ultimate goal of our monetary policy; that of the stability of the franc vis- à-vis the most solid European currencies  which is an intermediate objective to which the Banque de France is steadfastly committed  and that of the level of long-term interest rates  which is a result and an important indicator of our monetary strategy. l) Today  the Monetary Policy Council is happy to note that we fully meet these three entry criteria. The Council will continue to make sure that we abide by them throughout 1997 so that the Heads of State and Government can draw up the list of countries eligible for the euro in the best possible conditions  in accordance with the terms of the Dublin decision of the Heads of State and Government  “as soon as possible in 1998”. The euro will be created on 1 January 1999. Our market interest rates on maturities of more than two years already incorporate the credibility and soundness of the euro  the future single currency of European citizens. The agreement on the stability and growth pact drawn up in Dublin is a decisive element in inspiring confidence in the euro in French citizens and investors from around the world that is at least equal to the confidence in the French franc. This will give us low market interest rates in the euro area  which is good for growth  job creation and the fight against unemployment. BIS Review 2/1997

PRESS RELEASE  10/1/97.,Dr. Hämäläinen reviews developments in the Finnish economy in 1996 Review by the Governor of the Bank of Finland  Dr. Sirkka Hämäläinen  in connection with the Bank of Finland’s Annual Accounts. PRESS RELEASE  10/1/97. Coherent economic policies and a stable international environment provided the appropriate conditions for steady growth and balanced performance of the Finnish economy in 1996. The rise in the price level was moderate and exchange rates remained fairly stable. For these reasons  it was possible to lower the instrumental interest rates of monetary policy to levels that were low by both historical and international standards. Long-term market rates followed the downward trend in short-term rates. Positive outcomes included a reduction in the central government deficit  the end of the banks' protracted series of financial losses and a noticeable improvement in the economy's external indebtedness. High unemployment continued to pose a serious problem. The consumer price index rose by about 1 per cent in 1996  and the indicator of underlying inflation  which serves as a basis for monetary policy  was even more subdued. During the summer and autumn months  a lively public discussion ensued on the possibility of deflation. There were however no signs of a general decline in the price level  and the entire configuration of asset prices  for example trended upward. Exports and investment provided less-than-expected stimulus to economic growth in 1996  but owing to a healthy rise in private consumption expenditure  total output is estimated to have grown by nearly 3 per cent. The market outlook for exports improved in the latter part of the year. Investment expenditure was buoyed mainly by previously started large-scale investment projects in the manufacturing sector  but construction activity picked up sharply in the latter part of the year. Because of a recovery in the service and construction sectors  the employment situation improved slightly  which had a salutary effect on expectations and demand in the household and corporate sectors. The growth in domestic demand helped to constrain the general government deficit  i.e. the combined deficit of central and local governments and social security funds. Nonetheless  the central government deficit remained large by both historical and international standards. The indebtedness of households and firms again eased considerably and the external indebtedness of the total economy continued to improve. The Bank of Finland continued to relax monetary policy in 1996. In the course of the year  the tender rate was lowered from 4.25 per cent to 3.0 per cent and the financial markets remained calm. The external value of the markka fluctuated to some extent but on the whole remained relatively stable. As the year progressed  the long-term interest rate moved considerably closer to the comparable German rate  and by the final months of the year the differential had stabilized at about ½ percentage point. One significant development in 1996 was the continued strengthening of the banks and the termination of a period of several years of negative financial results. The aggregate result turned positive largely because of reduced loan losses and lower cost levels. Nonetheless  domestic banks' profitability and capital adequacy have still not reached levels that can be considered good by international standards. Improved economic balance and steady economic policy enabled the Bank of Finland to make a proposal in October to the Government concerning the joining of the markka to the EU's Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). The proposal was approved and negotiations BIS Review 2/1997 - 2 - with other EU countries led to an agreed ECU central rate for the markka of FIM 5.80661  corresponding to a central rate against the Deutschemark of FIM 3.04. The agreed markka exchange rate configuration vis-à-vis major ERM currencies corresponds to the average level of recent years. After Italy joined the ERM in November  the markka's ECU central rate became FIM 5.85424. Bilateral central rates against other ERM currencies were not affected. Finland's purpose in joining the ERM was to ensure its eligibility to be among the first group of countries to move into Stage Three of EMU. According to the text of the Maastricht Treaty  the exchange rate convergence criterion requires exchange rate stability for two years prior to the examination and participation in the ERM. It now appears that the final decision on eligibility for Stage Three of EMU is slated for spring 1998. As the Bank of Finland reaffirmed in connection with the ERM linkup  the monetary policy objective remains that of keeping the inflation rate at about 2 per cent  which accords with the major EU countries. Although the inflation objective is consistent with the stable exchange rate objective  in the event of a disturbance  ERM participation would imply precedence of the exchange rate objective. The ERM's wide (± 15 per cent) fluctuation margins provide a good buffer against speculative activity  but clearly the need to meet the EMU exchange rate criterion and to maintain economic balance requires a much more stable course for exchange rates. Continuing progress in balancing central government finances and maintenance of the moderate cost trend are key factors as regards exchange rate stability. It is apparent that the easing of monetary policy and confidence in improving economic prospects will provide support for domestic demand over the future. With exports also picking up again  the growth of total output could reach 4 per cent in 1997. It appears that the rise in the price level will stay near the targeted level. The decline in unemployment should continue but again at a very sluggish pace. In order to accelerate the decline in the unemployment rate  the tax wedge should be narrowed further and the social security and tax systems should be made more work-friendly. It appears that Finland will be able to meet all the economic convergence criteria for EMU  i.e. those pertaining to inflation  exchange rates  the long-term interest rate  and the public sector deficit and debt. The decision on which countries are to participate in Stage Three of EMU is to made in spring 1998  only a little over a year from now  and before that time the Act on the Bank of Finland should be amended so that the EMU requirement regarding central bank independence can be fulfilled. Practical preparations within the EU for Economic and Monetary Union have progressed according to plans. The Bank of Finland has participated in the work of creating the European System of Central Banks  in both the European Monetary Institute (EMI) and the EU's Monetary Committee. The preparatory work involves inter alia strategy and instruments for the conduct of a single monetary policy as well as detailed planning of the payment system. Progress has also been made in specifying the legal status of the single currency - the euro - as well as in the design of euro notes and coins. Much work has also been required in the development of an exchange rate system covering both EMU participants and other EU states. The Bank of Finland's own preparations for Stage Three of EMU have intensified. The adoption of a single currency requires broad changes in the payment systems of the banks and the Bank of Finland. One major change will be the fusion of national payment systems into an EU-wide payment system. The Bank of Finland supports efficient and secure solutions  which will at the same time provide the best possible environment for Finnish banking and securities BIS Review 2/1997 - 3 - markets. Cooperative efforts between the banks and the Bank of Finland have intensified in all areas of concern  and the Bank of Finland is participating in the national EMU project of the Ministry of Finance. The Bank of Finland's financial result for 1996 marked a significant improvement over the last several years  which had resulted in an erosion of the Bank's capital position. The primary reason for the improvement was the sale to the state of the Sponda group  which had fallen to the Bank in the wake of the banking crisis. In this connection  the Bank received repayment of a loan to Sponda and partial compensation for forgone interest income. Final losses in connection with the takeover of Skopbank were included in the Bank's balance sheet in 1996: the loss of equity capital amounted to about FIM 5 billion. The Bank of Finland's result for 1996 after capitalization of prior years' losses not previously recorded in the balance sheet was FIM 3 754 million  which was added to the reserve fund in the balance sheet  thus strengthening the Bank's capital position.

Mr. Prime Minister  Minister of Finance  Minister of Budget  Rector Oosterlinck  Professor Peeters  ladies and gentlemen  it is a distinct honor  and a great personal pleasure  to be here today to receive this degree from such a distinguished and historic university. Central bankers  because of the continuity of our institutions and the nature of our responsibilities  typically are said to take a long-term view. By that  I mean we try to look beyond the current calendar quarter to the next year or maybe even a few years beyond. Standing here in this university  which was founded more than 500 years ago and had already become a leading university in Europe by the 16th century  gives a meaningful perspective to what central bankers consider the longer term. Today  I shall address the various roles of a central bank encompassing: bank supervision  the provision of financial services  and  of course  monetary policy. I recognize that not all central banks are the same  and in particular that the central bank’s role in bank supervision varies considerably from one country to another. However  I view these three elements of a central bank’s responsibilities as closely interrelated and mutually supporting  in ways that I will endeavor to elaborate. Before doing so  I might note that the global financial environment in which central banks operate has become an increasingly important factor in carrying out our responsibilities. This is obviously true of smaller and more open economies like Belgium  but it is true also of countries like the United States that are sometimes thought to be self-contained. Monetary policy in all countries must take account of its effects on  and feedback from  the rest of the world. Many financial services provided by central banks involve cross-border transactions of one kind or another. These international relationships add still one more degree of complexity to the already complex lives of central bankers. That is one of our challenges. One of the rewards is the international cooperation that these complexities have spawned. That process of cooperation has been especially deep and long-standing among central banks of the G-10 countries  but it involves finance ministries and officials from other agencies and other countries  as well. I call this one of the rewards not just because it has enhanced the policy process but also  on a more personal level  because it has enabled me to develop good friendships with many of my counterparts  including Alfons Verplaetse of the National Bank of Belgium. Let me begin with the fundamental observation  that a nation’s sovereign credit rating lies at the base of its current fiscal  monetary  and  indirectly  regulatory policy. When there is confidence in the integrity of government  monetary authorities -- the central bank and the finance ministry -- can issue unlimited claims denominated in their own currencies and can guarantee or stand ready to guarantee the obligations of private issuers as they see fit. This power has profound implications for both good and ill for our economies. Central banks can issue currency  a non-interest-bearing claim on the government  effectively without limit. They can discount loans and other assets of banks or other private depository institutions  thereby converting potentially illiquid private assets into riskless claims on the government in the form of deposits at the central bank. BIS Review 3/1997 - 2 - That all of these claims on government are readily accepted reflects the fact that a government cannot become insolvent with respect to obligations in its own currency. A fiat money system  like the ones we have today  can produce such claims without limit. To be sure  if a central bank produces too many  inflation will inexorably rise as will interest rates  and economic activity will inevitably be constrained by the misallocation of resources induced by inflation. If it produces too few  the economy’s expansion also will presumably be constrained by a shortage of the necessary lubricant for transactions. Authorities must struggle continuously to find the proper balance. It was not always thus. For most of the period prior to the early 1930s  obligations of governments in major countries were payable in gold. This meant the whole outstanding debt of government was subject to redemption in a medium  the quantity of which could not be altered at the will of government. Hence  debt issuance and budget deficits were constrained by the potential market response to an inflated economy. It was even possible in such a monetary regime for a government to become insolvent. Indeed  the United States skirted on the edges of bankruptcy in 1895 when our government gold stock shrank ominously and was bailed out by a last minute gold loan  underwritten by a Wall Street syndicate. There is little doubt that under the gold standard the restraint on both public and private credit creation limited price inflation  but it was also increasingly perceived as too restrictive to government discretion. The abandonment of the domestic convertibility of gold effectively augmented the power of the monetary authorities to create claims. Possibly as a consequence  post-World War II fluctuations in gross domestic product have been somewhat less than those prior to the 1930s  and no major economic contraction of the dimensions experienced in earlier years has occurred in major industrial countries. On the other hand  peace-time inflation has been far more virulent. Today  the widespread presumption is that  as a consequence of expectations of continuing inflation over the longer run  both nominal and real long-term interest rates are currently higher than they would otherwise be. Arguably  at root is the potential  however remote  of unconstrained issuance of claims unsupported by the production of goods and services and the accumulation of real assets. Pressures for increased credit unrelated to the needs of markets emerge not only as a consequence of new government debt obligations  both direct and contingent  but also because of government regulations that induce private sector expenditure and borrowing. All of these government-derived demands on resources must be satisfied. Hence  when those demands increase  interest rates tend to rise to crowd out other types of spending. Any employment of the sovereign credit rating for the issuance of government debt  the guaranteeing of the liabilities of depository institutions  or the liquification of assets of depository institutions enables the preemption of real private resources by government fiat. Increased availability of a central bank credit facility  even if not drawn upon  can induce increased credit extension by banks and increased activity by their customers  since creditors of banks are more willing to finance banks’ activities with such a governmental backstop available. If that takes place in an environment of strained resource availability  expanded subsidies to depository institutions -- which are often referred to as the “safety net” -- can only augment the pressures. An accommodative monetary policy can ease the strain  but only temporarily and only at the risk of inflation at a later date unless interest rates are eventually allowed to rise. This dilemma is most historically evident in its extreme form during times of war  when governments must choose whether to finance part of the increased war outlays BIS Review 3/1997 - 3 - through increased central bank credit or depend wholly on taxes and borrowing from private sources. Accordingly central banks  and finance ministries  must remain especially vigilant in maintaining a proper balance between a safety net that fosters economic and financial stabilization and one that does not. It is in this context of competing demands for resources and the government’s unique position that we should consider the role of the central bank in interfacing with banks  and in some instances with other private financial institutions  as lenders of last resort  supervisors  and providers of financial services. Relationship to banks and bank supervision It is important to remember that many of the benefits banks provide modern societies derive from their willingness to take risks and from their use of a relatively high degree of financial leverage. Through leverage  in the form principally of taking deposits  banks perform a critical role in the financial intermediation process; they provide savers with additional investment choices and borrowers with a greater range of sources of credit  thereby facilitating a more efficient allocation of resources and contributing importantly to greater economic growth. Indeed  it has been the evident value of intermediation and leverage that has shaped the development of our financial systems from the earliest times -- certainly since Renaissance goldsmiths discovered that lending out deposited gold was feasible and profitable. Central bank provision of a mechanism for converting highly illiquid portfolios into liquid ones in extraordinary circumstances has led to a greater degree of leverage in banking than market forces alone would support. Traditionally this has been accomplished by making discount or Lombard facilities available  so that individual depositories could turn illiquid assets into liquid resources and not exacerbate unsettled market conditions by the forced selling of such assets or the calling of loans. More broadly  open market operations  in situations like that which followed the crash of stock markets around the world in 1987  satisfy increased needs for liquidity for the system as a whole that otherwise could feed cumulative  self-reinforcing  contractions across many financial markets. Of course  this same leverage and risk-taking also greatly increase the possibility of bank failures. Without leverage  losses from risk-taking would be absorbed by a bank’s owners  virtually eliminating the chance that the bank would be unable to meet its obligations in the case of a “failure.” Some failures can be of a bank’s own making  resulting  for example  from poor credit judgments. For the most part  these failures are a normal and important part of the market process and provide discipline and information to other participants regarding the level of business risks. However  because of the important roles that banks and other financial intermediaries play in our financial systems  such failures could have large ripple effects that spread throughout business and financial markets at great cost. Any use of sovereign credit -- even its potential use -- creates moral hazard  that is  a distortion of incentives that occurs when the party that determines the level of risk receives the gains from  but does not bear the full costs of  the risks taken. At the extreme  monetary authorities could guarantee all private liabilities  which might assuage any immediate crisis but leave a long-term legacy of distorted incentives and presumably thwarted growth potential. Thus  governments  including central banks  have to strive for a balanced use of the sovereign credit rating. It is a difficult tradeoff  but we are seeking a balance in which we can ensure the desired degree of intermediation even in times of financial stress without engendering an unacceptable degree of moral hazard. BIS Review 3/1997 - 4 - The disconnect between risk-taking by banks and banks’ cost of capital  which has been reduced by the presence of the safety net  has made necessary a degree of supervision and regulation that would not be necessary without the existence of the safety net. That is  regulators are compelled to act as a surrogate for market discipline since the market signals that usually accompany excessive risk-taking are substantially muted  and because the prices to banks of government deposit guarantees  or of access to the safety net more generally  do not  and probably cannot  vary sufficiently with risk to mimic market prices. The problems that arise from the retarding of the pressures of market discipline have led us increasingly to understand that the ideal strategy for supervision and regulation is to endeavor to simulate the market responses that would occur if there were no safety net  but without giving up the basic requirement that financial market disruptions be minimized. To be sure  we should recognize that if we choose to have the advantages of a leveraged system of financial intermediaries  the burden of managing risk in the financial system will not lie with the private sector alone. With leveraging there will always exist a remote possibility of a chain reaction  a cascading sequence of defaults that will culminate in financial implosion if it proceeds unchecked. Only a central bank  with its unlimited power to create money  can with a high probability thwart such a process before it becomes destructive. Hence  central banks will of necessity be drawn into becoming lenders of last resort. But implicit in the existence of such a role is that there will be some sort of allocation between the public and private sectors of the burden of risk of extreme outcomes. Thus  central banks are led to provide what essentially amounts to catastrophic financial insurance coverage. Such a public subsidy should be reserved for only the rarest of disasters. If the owners or managers of private financial institutions were to anticipate being propped up frequently by government support  it would only encourage reckless and irresponsible practices. In theory  the allocation of responsibility for risk-bearing between the private sector and the central bank depends upon an evaluation of the private cost of capital. In order to attract  or at least retain  capital  a private financial institution must earn at minimum the overall economy’s rate of return  adjusted for risk. In competitive financial markets  the greater the leverage  the higher the rate of return  before adjustment for risk. If private financial institutions have to absorb all financial risk  then the degree to which they can leverage will be limited  the financial sector smaller  and its contribution to the economy more limited. On the other hand  if central banks effectively insulate private institutions from the largest potential losses  however incurred  increased laxity could threaten a major drain on taxpayers or produce inflationary instability as a consequence of excess money creation. In practice  the policy choice of how much  if any  of the extreme market risk that government authorities should absorb is fraught with many complexities. Yet we central bankers make this decision every day  either explicitly or by default. Moreover  we can never know for sure whether the decisions we made were appropriate. The question is not whether our actions are seen to have been necessary in retrospect; the absence of a fire does not mean that we should not have paid for fire insurance. Rather  the question is whether  ex ante  the probability of a systemic collapse was sufficient to warrant intervention. Often  we cannot wait to see whether  in hindsight  the problem will be judged to have been an isolated event and largely benign. Thus  governments  including central banks  have been given certain responsibilities related to their banking and financial systems that must be balanced. We have the responsibility to prevent major financial market disruptions through development and enforcement of prudent regulatory standards and  if necessary in rare circumstances  through BIS Review 3/1997 - 5 - direct intervention in market events. But we also have the responsibility to ensure that private sector institutions have the capacity to take prudent and appropriate risks  even though such risks will sometimes result in unanticipated bank losses or even bank failures. Our goal as supervisors  therefore  should not be to prevent all bank failures  but to maintain sufficient prudential standards so that banking problems that do occur do not become widespread. We try to achieve the proper balance through official regulations  as well as through formal and informal supervisory policies and procedures. To some extent  we do this over time by signalling to the market  through our actions  the kinds of circumstances in which we might be willing to intervene to quell financial turmoil  and conversely  what levels of difficulties we expect private institutions to resolve by themselves. The market  then  responds by adjusting the cost of capital to banks. Throughout most of this century  we central bankers have made our decisions largely in a domestic context. However  in recent decades that situation has changed markedly for many countries and  obviously  is changing rapidly here in Europe. While failures will inevitably occur in a dynamic market  the safety net -- not to mention concerns over systemic risk -- requires that regulators not be indifferent to how banks manage their risks. To avoid having to resort to numbing micromanagement  regulators have increasingly insisted that banks put in place systems that allow management to have both the information and procedures to be aware of their own true risk exposures on a global basis and to be able to modify such exposures. The better these risk information and control systems  the more risk a bank can prudently assume. The revolution in information and data processing technology has transformed our financial markets and the way our financial institutions conduct their operations. In most respects  these technological advances have enhanced the potential for reducing transactions costs  to the benefit of consumers of financial services  and for managing risks. But in some respects they have increased the potential for more rapid and widespread disruption. The efficiency of global financial markets  engendered by the rapid proliferation of financial products  has the capability of transmitting mistakes at a far faster pace throughout the financial system in ways that were unknown a generation ago  and not even remotely imagined in the 19th century. Financial crises in the early 19th century  for example  particularly those associated with the Napoleonic Wars  were often related to military and other events in faraway places. Communication was still comparatively primitive. An investor’s speculative position could be wiped out by a military setback  and he might not even know about it for days or even weeks. Similarly  the collapse of Barings Brothers in 1995 showed how much more rapidly losses can be generated in the current environment relative to a century earlier when Barings Brothers confronted a similar episode. Current technology enables single individuals to initiate massive transactions with very rapid execution. Clearly  not only has the productivity of global finance increased markedly  but so  obviously  has the ability to generate losses at a previously inconceivable rate. Whether we think about risk in financial markets from a national or  increasingly  international perspective  we should recognize that  if it is technology that has imparted occasional stress to markets  technology can be employed to contain it. Enhancements BIS Review 3/1997 - 6 - to financial institutions’ internal risk-management systems arguably constitute one of the most effective countermeasures to the increased potential instability of the global financial system. Because the evolution of new technologies takes time  I suspect that we have tended to exaggerate the negative effects of information and data processing technologies on financial markets. We have focussed on the ability of financial market participants to increase their leverage beyond the elusive optimum point. That is  some have voiced concern that the subsidy embodied in the safety net has supported a greater degree of risk-taking than might be appropriate. This is obviously a legitimate concern. Nonetheless  although we may not yet fully appreciate the benefits of recent technological advances  the availability of new technology and new derivative financial instruments already has facilitated more rigorous approaches to the conceptualization  measurement  and management of risk by financial institutions. There are  of course  limitations to the statistical models used in such systems owing to the necessity of overly simplifying assumptions. Consequently  human judgments  based on analytically less precise but far more realistic evaluations of what the future may hold  are of critical importance in risk management. Although a sophisticated understanding of statistical modeling techniques is important to risk management  an intimate knowledge of the markets in which an institution trades  and of the customers it serves  is turning out to be far more important. The diminishing of legal  institutional  and now technological barriers to international financial activities has provided strong impetus to the process of cooperation I referred to earlier. The efforts of bank supervisors meeting at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel have been especially prominent  and deservedly so. They have set minimum standards for sound banking for the world’s major banks and have sensitized all of us to the risks that banks must manage. However  their work is not done. Our concepts of appropriate standards continue to evolve just as the technology of risk management evolves. In addition  supervisors from the G-10 countries must continue their efforts to bring supervisors from other countries  including the emerging and transition economies of Asia  Latin America  and Eastern Europe into the process of cooperation -- both to learn from their experiences and to encourage other countries to strengthen their own supervisory systems. Financial services While I do not intend to say much about the provision of financial services by central banks  I might distinguish -- in an oversimplified fashion -- two types of functions. One includes issuing currency  acting as fiscal agent for the government  and other functions that are reasonably straightforward and primarily  though not exclusively  domestic in character. I say straightforward  although I recognize that central bankers in Europe are devoting an extraordinary amount of effort to making sure that such functions will be performed well even as the monetary side of the European Union evolves. These are crucial functions that central banks naturally perform. Nevertheless  one should consider from time to time the extent to which the private sector could perform some of these functions more effectively. The other type of function relates more closely to the principal thrust of my remarks today and involves the need to ensure that the global financial system operates smoothly. What I have in mind specifically is a central bank’s role in large value or interbank payment systems: on the one hand  setting standards for risk controls and monitoring the systems; on the other hand  providing certainty  or “finality ” to payments made among BIS Review 3/1997 - 7 - participants in the system and  when necessary and appropriate  providing liquidity to participants. Any private bank  or for that matter any private business organization  can provide payment services with final settlement. The difficulty is that the final claim on the books of any private institution is not risk-free. Only a central bank is in a position to perform these functions under all circumstances. That  of course  is an element of the safety net  and it therefore raises the same issues of moral hazard and potential abuse of a nation’s sovereign credit rating. To be sure  private financial institutions themselves must work to develop the infrastructure for ensuring that payments and settlements can take place with reasonable confidence and that the risks other than those absorbed by the central bank are well understood and properly managed. Those risks will not be eliminated entirely; reducing “float” in the payment system to zero  which would eliminate settlement risk  must be balanced by the capital costs of doing so. It has been just in the last year or so that the risks associated with settlement of the enormous volume of foreign exchange transactions have been fully appreciated  more than 20 years after an incident involving Bank Herstatt in Germany brought this issue to international attention. A report produced last year by a G-10 central bank committee elaborated on these risks and urged the private sector to respond with appropriate institutions and risk controls. I am encouraged that much progress seems to be underway in this area  as in others. Monetary policy This brings me  finally  to the area of monetary policy -- the fundamental responsibility of a modern central bank. In this area  I am pleased to say  there have been positive developments  especially with regard to inflation. The recent record on inflation reduction in industrial countries has been impressive. Measured consumer price inflation in G- 10 countries averaged only about 2-1/4 percent last year  down more than 3 percentage points from what it was in 1990. Consumer price increases on average in the G-10 have been kept under 3 percent for the past five years -- the longest such period of sustained low inflation in more than three decades. Inflation performance in developing countries also has improved substantially. This success reflects in large part a thorough conceptual overhaul of economic thinking and policymaking. A consensus gradually emerged starting in the late 1970s that inflation destroyed jobs  or at least could not create them. This view has become particularly evident in the communiques that have emanated from the high-level international gatherings of the past two decades. We should take care  however  that our recent success not make us complacent. It is becoming increasingly evident that a key ingredient in achieving the highest possible levels of productivity  real incomes  and living standards over the long run is maintenance of price stability. But to sustain good inflation performance  we need to understand the other factors that lie behind our recent success  in addition to the policy consensus of governments  which must not be allowed to ebb as memories of the stagflation in the 1970s fade. Internally  various steps are being implemented that free up markets and intensify competition  not just in product markets  but in labor markets and financial sectors as well. On the external side  emerging nations  especially in Asia and Latin America  have become increasingly important as production sites and markets and thus as competitors. Faced with this broadened foreign competition  firms in many countries now find it less easy than in the past to raise prices during periods of rising demand at home. BIS Review 3/1997 - 8 - The process of adjustment has not been entirely painless. Industrial economies in particular are going through an extended period of economic and financial restructuring that has hit some sectors  firms  and groups of workers particularly hard. The fact that in the past these groups may have felt insulated from such forces probably heightened the consequent stress  and may have contributed to some general uncertainty and insecurity. As a result  workers at present  to a greater extent than usual  trade aspirations for higher levels of earnings for job security. Clearly it takes some time for an economy to realize the full benefits of transition from a high- or even moderate-inflation environment -- with associated uncertainties about future inflation -- to one where inflation is low and under control. Inflation expectations throughout the economy must fall  and financial-market premia related to inflation uncertainty have to dissipate. I doubt the tasks of central bankers will become any easier as we move into the 21st century. Clearly price stability should and will remain the central goal of our activities. But we are having increasing difficulty in pinning down the notion of what constitutes a stable price level. When industrial product was the centerpiece of the advanced economies during the first two-thirds of this century  our overall price indexes served us well. Pricing a pound of electrolytic copper presented few definitional problems. The price of a ton of cold rolled steel sheet  or a linear yard of cotton broad woven fabric  could be reasonably compared over a period of years. But as the century draws to a close  the simple notion of price has turned decidedly ambiguous. What is the price of a unit of software or a legal opinion? How does one evaluate the change in the price of a cataract operation over a ten-year period when the nature of the procedure and its impact on the patient has changed so radically. Indeed  how will we measure inflation  and the associated financial and real implications  in the 21st century when our data -- using current techniques -- could become increasingly less adequate to trace price trends over time? So long as individuals make contractual arrangements for future payments valued in dollars  or marks  or francs  there must be a presumption on the part of those involved in the transaction about the future purchasing power of money. No matter how complex individual products become  there will always be some general sense of the purchasing power of money both across time and across goods and services. Hence  we must assume that embodied in all products is some unit of output and hence of price that is recognizable to producers and consumers and upon which they will base their decisions. Doubtless  we will develop new techniques of price measurement to unearth them as the years go on. It is crucial that we do  for inflation can destabilize an economy even if faulty price indexes fail to reveal it. However such conceptual and technical issues are resolved  central bankers need to err on the side of caution. Working in the context of our individual political environments  we are the ultimate protectors and preservers of the value of our currencies. A central banker cannot be exempted from one very basic fact: In the long run inflation is essentially a monetary phenomenon. Accordingly  the best approach is to maintain a steady course with an appropriate level of restraint. Countries whose currencies are widely used internationally  like the United States  have a special responsibility to provide an anchor of stability for themselves and the world at large. BIS Review 3/1997 Conclusion - 9 - together let me bring In conclusion  three aspects of central bank responsibilities. Monetary policy must aim to provide a stable macroeconomic environment  to promote sustainable long-term economic growth without inflation and to allow financial markets to operate without excessive uncertainty. Central banks provide direct support to financial markets through their role in the safety net  that is  the extension to the financial system  under certain circumstances  of the nation’s sovereign credit rating. This element of subsidy requires a degree of supervision and regulation to ensure that the safety net is not abused. The payment system  and the central banks’ involvement in it  is a key element of the safety net and is  as well  at the core of the financial system through which monetary policy is implemented. Central banks  like everyone else  operate in a global financial market. I can say with some confidence that everywhere  not just in Europe  the concept of a domestic market will have even less meaning in a decade than it does today. It is much more difficult to predict what the world will look like in all its dimensions  but my hope and expectation is that central banks will play a positive part. As all industrial countries are likely to experience similar forces  cooperation is key to our continued success. BIS Review 3/1997

Meyer  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the Charlotte Economics Club  Charlotte  North Carolina on 16/1/97. 1996 was an extraordinarily good year for the economy. Measured on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis  it appears that GDP advanced around 3% and prices  measured by the chain price index for GDP  increased just above 2%. A little historical perspective will help us further appreciate recent economic performance. Inflation in 1996  measured by the chain price index for GDP or the core CPI  was the lowest in 30 years. And this was not a one-year fluke. Last year was the fifth consecutive year that inflation  measured by the chain GDP price index  was 2.6% or lower and the 5-year compound annual inflation rate is now 2.5%  the lowest since 1967. The extraordinary achievement of 1996  of course  was reaching such low levels of unemployment and inflation at the same time. The 5.4% unemployment rate in 1996 was the lowest annual rate since 1988 and before that since 1973. Specifically  the surprise was a decline in measures of core inflation for consumer and producer goods and in the inflation rate for the GDP price index during a year when the unemployment rate declined and averaged more than ½ percentage point below levels that in the past had been associated with stable inflation. In the second half of the year  growth slowed  the unemployment rate stabilized  and inflation remained well contained. There is little evidence of imbalances that would jeopardize the expansion. As a result  the consensus forecast projects growth near trend and relatively stable inflation and unemployment rates. We should not  however  let ourselves be overcome by our good fortune. The business cycle is not dead and monetary policy is certain to be challenged again. At the moment  trend growth near full employment appears to be a reasonable prospect in the year ahead. Still we want to remain alert for challenges that might lie just over the horizon. In particular  there remains some uncertainty as to whether the current unemployment rate will prove consistent with stable inflation over time and we need to pay some attention to the challenge of how we approach our longer-term goal of achieving and maintaining price stability. First I will discuss the risks in the outlook. Next I will consider some explanations for the surprisingly good recent inflation performance and implications for inflation going forward. I’ll end with a discussion of challenges for the Federal Reserve: three it has faced and met in this expansion  one still in play  and one that may deserve further attention. Balanced Risks Going Forward When I arrived at the Board in late June of last year  the risks appeared to be one-sided. The economy was near capacity and growing above trend. There was a clear risk of overheating  and monetary policy was poised to tighten if necessary. But the forecast was that growth would slow toward trend and  given how well behaved inflation remained  we believed we could afford to be patient and give economic growth a chance to moderate and  so far at least  that patience appears to have been justified. BIS Review 4/1997 - 2 - During the second half of 1996  the risks in the outlook became more balanced. The most recent data suggest stronger growth in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter  but growth in the second half of 1996 seems to have been slower than in the first half of the year  and the recent data have not altered my expectation that the economy will grow near trend over the next year. What factors might disturb this benign picture? I want to focus on two basic risks in the outlook – what I will refer to as utilization risk and the growth risk. Let’s start with the utilization risk. There is a risk that the current unemployment rate is already below its critical threshold  the full employment unemployment rate  also known as the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment  or NAIRU. In this case  trend growth would sustain the prevailing unemployment rate and would therefore be accompanied by modest upward pressure on the inflation rate. Compensation per hour has been edging upward  consistent with the unemployment rate being slightly below NAIRU; on the other hand  core measures of inflation have been trending lower  with the opposite implication. This contrast has kept the Federal Reserve alert  but on the sidelines. But it would be unwise to ignore this risk factor. The growth risk is the risk that growth will be above or below trend. Higher trend growth is unquestionably desirable and should  of course  be accommodated by monetary policy. But above-trend growth implies rising utilization rates. Given that the economy is already near capacity  such an increase in utilization rates would raise the risk of higher inflation. When you are near full employment with stable inflation and growing at trend  both higher and lower growth become risk factors. Another way of making this point is that the downside of such excellent economic performance is that virtually any alternative scenario will represent a deterioration. It’s like being at the top of a mountain. There is an exhilaration from getting there and the view is great  but all paths are downhill. Still  history suggests that expansions do not usually end because aggregate demand spontaneously weakens  but rather as a result of excessively buoyant demand  resulting in an overheated economy and an associated acceleration of inflation. On balance  taking into account the possibility that we are already slightly below NAIRU and historical precedent  I have slightly greater concern that inflation will increase than that the economy will lapse into persistent below trend growth and face rising unemployment and further disinflation. This modest asymmetry relative to the base forecast suggests that we need to balance our celebration over recent economic performance with a vigilance with respect to future developments to ensure that the progress we have made with respect to inflation over the last fifteen years is not eroded. The Inflation - Unemployment Rate Puzzle The recent surprisingly good inflation performance challenges our understanding of inflation dynamics. The equation relied on in most structural macro models to explain inflation  the Phillips Curve  has recently been over-predicting inflation. Some will no doubt argue that there should be no great surprise here because the Phillips Curve regularity between short-run movements in inflation and unemployment was long ago theoretically discredited and historically repudiated. When I hear such remarks  and I often do  I know I am listening to someone who has not bothered to look at the data and probably has never estimated a Phillips Curve nor tried his or her hand at forecasting inflation. The truth is that the Philips Curve  in its modern  expectations-augmented form  was the single most stable and useful econometric tool in a forecaster’s arsenal for most of the last fifteen years. BIS Review 4/1997 - 3 - During this period at Laurence H. Meyer & Associates  our excellent inflation forecasting record was based on one simple rule: don’t try to outguess our Phillips Curve. We did not always  of course  religiously follow our own rule. I remember vividly one episode when inflation accelerated early in the year and I convinced my partners to adjust our inflation forecast upward by add-factoring our Phillips Curve. One of our clients called to brag that he was going to make a better inflation forecast for the year than we were. His secret: he was going to ignore our judgment and listen to our model instead. He suggested we do likewise. He was right. Our equation once again distinguished itself. Over the last couple of years  however  estimated Phillips Curves have generally been subject to systematic over-prediction errors; that is  the inflation rate is lower than would have been expected based on the historical relationship and given the prevailing unemployment rate. One possibility is that the equilibrium unemployment rate  or NAIRU  has declined. The estimated value of NAIRU is generally determined in the process of estimating the Phillips Curve; it is the value of the unemployment rate consistent with equality between actual and expected inflation where expected inflation is typically proxied by lagged inflation. Historically  NAIRU has been estimated as a constant  or as a time-varying series that changes over time only due to demographic changes in the labor force. Recently  several studies have used time-varying parameter estimation techniques to look for evidence of a recent decline in NAIRU. Bob Gordon  for example  finds that  based on time-varying parameter estimates  NAIRU has declined from a relatively constant value of 6% over the previous decade to near 5 ½% recently. If the claim that NAIRU has declined recently is correct  it would obviously help explain why we were able to achieve simultaneously low rates of inflation and unemployment in 1996. But  to build confidence in this result  we would like to be able to tell a qualitative story that explains why NAIRU may have declined and find evidence in labor markets  beyond the time varying parameter estimates of NAIRU  that is consistent with it. The source of the decline in NAIRU will  hopefully  help us to answer a very important related question. To the extent that there has been a decline in NAIRU  is it likely to be permanent or transitory? This may have important implications for the inflation forecast over the coming year. I am going to develop two sets of explanations for the surprisingly good performance of inflation relative to unemployment. The first is that there have been a series of favorable supply shocks that have temporarily lowered inflation  for a given unemployment rate  resulting in the appearance of a decline in NAIRU. In this case  absent further favorable supply shocks  inflation performance will not be as favorable for any given unemployment rate as we return to the historical relationship between inflation and unemployment. Second  there may have been a longer-lasting change in the bargaining power of workers relative to firms and/or in the competitive pressure on firms that has resulted in unusual restraint in wage gains and price increases. One explanation in this genre is the “job insecurity” hypothesis and a second is the “absence of pricing leverage” hypothesis. Both are consistent with anecdotal accounts we read about almost daily in the newspapers and hear from businesses  but both of these explanations are difficult to quantify and therefore to test. Let’s begin with the favorable supply shock story. We start with a simple version of the Phillips Curve which relates inflation to expected inflation and the gap between unemployment rate and NAIRU. Estimated versions of such a Phillips Curve typically also take some supply shocks into account. Supply shocks refer to exogenous changes in sectoral prices (or wages) which may affect the overall price (or wage) level and  at least temporarily  the overall inflation rate. The classic examples would be legislated changes in the minimum wage  BIS Review 4/1997 - 4 - weather-related movements in food prices  and politically inspired changes in energy prices. An adverse supply shock -- an increase in oil prices  for example -- would raise the rate of inflation at any given unemployment rate. Traditionally  NAIRU is estimated assuming an absence of supply shocks. It is the unemployment rate that is consistent with stable inflation in the long run  or  alternatively  is consistent with stable inflation in the absence of supply shocks. We can also calculate a short-run or effective NAIRU as the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation given whatever supply shocks are in play at the moment. In the case of an adverse supply shock  for example  the short-run or effective NAIRU would be higher than the long-run NAIRU. This simply means that the unemployment rate required to hold overall inflation constant in the face of an increase in oil prices has to be high enough so that inflation in the non-oil sectors will slow on average. Before we can tell the story about favorable supply shocks  I should note that 1996 featured an unusual coincidence of adverse supply shocks. First  the minimum wage was increased; this should boost overall wage gains  labor costs and hence prices. Second  both food and energy prices increased faster than other prices. As a result of the food and energy price increases  there were wide gaps between overall and core measures of inflation for both the PPI and the CPI. The overall CPI increased about ¾ percentage point more than the core CPI and overall PPI increased more than two percentage points faster than core PPI. However  because minimum wage increases  food and energy price increases are routinely included as shock terms in estimated Phillips Curves  these adverse shocks should not result in a systematic under-prediction of inflation and hence any sign of a change in NAIRU. But  despite the acceleration in the overall CPI from 2.5% over 1995 to 3.3% over 1996  the inflation performance was judged to be extraordinarily good because core measures of inflation declined. The core CPI fell  for example  from 3% to 2.6%. Even the overall GDP price index declined  reflecting the combination of a decline in core inflation  a larger weight for computer prices  different treatment of medical costs  and a smaller weight for food and energy in the GDP price index compared with the CPI. It is this well-contained behavior of the core CPI and the GDP price index that is not predicted by typical Phillips Curves and therefore suggests a decline in NAIRU. One explanation of this decline in core inflation is a series of favorable supply shocks in play over the last year or two. The key is that these supply shocks are generally not included in estimated Phillips Curves  so that Phillips Curves missed their effects and over-predicted inflation. The first favorable supply shock is the widely celebrated decline in health care costs  associated with the movement of firms to managed care plans and changes in the medical care market which lowered medical price inflation; this reduced benefit costs to firms  lowered the increase in overall labor costs  and reduced the pressure to raise prices. The second favorable supply shock is the especially rapid decline in computer prices over the past year or two. Third  import prices declined over 1996  due to both lower inflation abroad and the recent appreciation of the dollar. The decline in import prices has a direct effect on the core CPI through the lower cost of purchasing imported goods and an indirect effect on the GDP deflator through the restraint of lower import prices on pricing decisions by U.S. producers. I am not going to support this discussion today with a full recitation of the data. However  each of these developments can be measured  each works to lower “core” inflation over the last year or two  and  collectively  these favorable supply shocks explain at least some BIS Review 4/1997 - 5 - portion of the apparent decline in NAIRU. Because the supply shocks are likely to be temporary  part of the apparent decline in NAIRU is likely to be transitory and we may therefore see some gradual increase in core inflation this year  depending to be sure  on what happens to computer prices  benefit costs  and import prices. On the other hand  any resulting increase in core inflation may be more than offset in 1997 by a slowing of the increase in food prices and a partial reversal of the recent increase in energy prices. Let me now turn to the more challenging stories  job insecurity and absence of pricing leverage. The anecdotal “evidence” in each case is impressive  but it is  nevertheless  difficult to quantify these forces and therefore test their significance and measure their importance. But let’s at least make an effort to understand the stories. The worker insecurity hypothesis seeks to explain the recent favorable inflation performance as a labor market event  in which workers have been cowed by the recent spate of job losses (or threats of job losses) and  as a result  are less likely to push for additional wage increases  even in tight labor markets. Two issues have to be addressed relative to this hypothesis. Is there evidence in labor market data  other than via Phillips Curve equations  to support this hypothesis? Is the decline in NAIRU resulting from worker insecurity permanent or temporary? There are two types of evidence supporting the hypothesis that workers have become less secure about their jobs. The first is that the proportion of workers who have suffered a permanent job loss in recent years looks high relative to the late 1980s when the aggregate unemployment rate was similar to its current level; this is consistent with the increased reports of corporate downsizing we’ve seen in this decade. For example  according to data BLS released this past fall  the percent of workers who were displaced from their job between 1993 and 1995 was nearly as high as in the previous recession  and well above the displacement rates seen in the late 1980s. Similarly  the percentage of unemployed who were permanently separated from their job has continued to trend up. These surveys also suggest that a broader spectrum of workers have been affected by permanent job losses. The idea that unskilled blue-collar workers are the only group with significant risk of a permanent job loss is no longer valid. Job displacement rates are up for white-collar workers  more educated workers  and those with greater tenure. The second piece of evidence supporting the job insecurity story is that workers appear reluctant to voluntarily leave their jobs because of an increased apprehension about the difficulty in finding a comparable new job. Although there is anecdotal evidence that fears about skill obsolescence and loss of health insurance are important factors influencing worker concerns  the sources of worker anxiety are difficult to measure with any accuracy. Nonetheless  there does appear to be a smaller flow of quits into unemployment than would be expected at this stage of the expansion. In a sense  the deterioration in workers’ perception of their job security can be viewed as an outward shift in their labor supply schedule -- a decline in the reservation wage  if you will. The result of this shift in the supply curve is a decline in the real wage to a new equilibrium level. And during the transition to this new equilibrium  nominal wage growth will fall short of its normal relationship to prices and the unemployment rate  appearing as transitory decline in NAIRU. Whether the decline in job security also leads to a permanent decline in NAIRU is a more difficult issue to assess. BIS Review 4/1997 - 6 - An alternative or complementary explanation for the surprising inflation performance is the perception of an absence of pricing leverage on the part of firms. In this story  the dynamics of the inflation process seem almost reversed from the way I have traditionally modeled them. The traditional econometric model specifies prices as set in relation to costs. The mark-up may vary cyclically  but the major source of cyclical rise in inflation is via a cyclical rise in costs  primarily through cyclical increases in wage costs  in turn due to demand pressure in the labor market. The firm passes forward such increases in costs. The real action is in the labor market. Today  by contrast  it appears that the dynamics have been reversed. The point of departure is the perceived inability of firms to pass forward increases in costs. That dictates an obsession by firms with containing costs. That means bargaining aggressively to avoid increases in wage costs  intensive efforts to offset any wage increases with productivity gains  and the necessity of absorbing in profit margins increases in costs that cannot be offset. The absence of pricing leverage is generally attributed to a perception of increased competition. Every firm fears being the first to raise prices and suffer  as a consequence  an increase in its relative prices and a decline in market share. There are at least two problems with this explanation. First  we have to identify the source of the fundamental change in competitive pressure. Second  an exogenous increase in competitive pressure should initially compress profit margins  whereas firm profitability has remained very high. The absence of pricing leverage may simply reflect the fact that product markets are not tight  compared to labor markets. There may be some excess demand in labor markets  but the effect on wages and prices is being offset for the moment by favorable supply shocks. On the other hand  capacity utilization rates show no signs of excess demand in product markets. It is excess demand that gives pricing leverage to firms. The absence of pricing leverage by firms  as a result of an absence of demand pressure  induces firms to work hard to restrain wage increases or to offset them with productivity gains. Let me sum up my interpretation of the recent unemployment and inflation experience. Economic performance has truly been excellent over the past year with a particularly impressive combination of low core inflation and low unemployment in 1996. But this performance does not suggest that the business cycle is dead or that the Phillips Curve is no longer relevant. The decline in core inflation during 1996 most likely reflects the role of a coincidence of favorable supply shocks. Developments in labor markets over the last few years do provide a hint of a modest decline in NAIRU  but the evidence is not definitive and it remains uncertain whether any decline in NAIRU is temporary or permanent. Consequently  a prudent monetary policy would be based on a working assumption that the underlying trend of inflation has been stabilized in the past couple of years and that we shall have to maintain a close watch for signs that inflationary pressures are mounting. Challenges for Monetary Policy Let me turn now to the implications of the economic outlook for challenges to monetary policy. I’ll discuss five challenges  three faced and met earlier in the expansion  one currently in play  and a fifth that deserves attention. The first challenge was the more erratic and  on average  slower pace of recovery following the last recession. This was due  in large measure  to the weight of a series of structural imbalances inherited from the previous expansion. In response to the unique features of the recovery  monetary policy remained unusually stimulative long into the expansion  with BIS Review 4/1997 - 7 - the Federal Reserve maintaining a 3% nominal federal funds rate and near-zero real federal funds rate for three years into the current expansion. The next challenge came when the “headwinds” began to abate and the economy was poised to move to more robust growth in 1994  at a time when the unemployment rate had already declined from its cyclical high to closer to estimates of full employment. The timing and aggressiveness of Federal Reserve tightening over 1994 met the second challenge  preventing overheating. The third challenge was to adjust monetary policy  once the economy showed signs of slowing in early 1995  to avoid overkill and set the foundation for trend growth near full employment with stable inflation. The two most common errors in cyclical monetary policy are  first  waiting too long to tighten and then not tightening aggressively enough in the initial stages; and  second  eventually overdoing tightening as a result of the lags in monetary policy. When monetary policy moves to tighten  the effects are initially  because of lags  small and hard to detect. So the temptation is to continue to tighten until the economy does slow. By this time the delayed effects of past tightening are building and threaten a sharper than desired slowdown. In late 1995 and early 1996  monetary policy reversed a small measure of the tightening over the previous year  preventing the sharp rise in interest rates over 1994 from producing a more persistent period of below-trend growth or even a recession. The fourth challenge  which we continue to face  is to preserve the expansion without allowing an acceleration in inflation. This challenge is heightened by uncertainty about the level of NAIRU and about the permanence of an apparent recent decline in NAIRU. Because of the lags  it is widely appreciated that it is desirable for monetary policy to be forward looking. But forward looking policy is predicated on confidence in a model that can predict how current and prospective economic conditions will affect inflation going forward. Uncertainty about NAIRU has  in my view  made monetary policy more cautious in responding to forecasts of inflation that depend on the relationship between the current unemployment rate and some estimate of NAIRU. At the prevailing unemployment rate  the challenge is to be especially watchful for early signs of mounting price pressures and  if necessary  to be at least swiftly reactive to limit and then reverse any acceleration of inflation that might occur. If the unemployment rate declines  however  a more forward-looking approach may quickly become appropriate. The fifth challenge is to embed what has  to date  clearly been excellent short-run adjustments of policy to sustain the expansion and prevent an acceleration of inflation in an overall approach that will achieve the Federal Reserve’s long-run objective of price stability. Achieving price stability is in our legislative mandate because it is the contribution we can make over the long run to enhancing economic efficiency and setting the foundation for sustainable growth. Perhaps  this would be a good place for me to stop and you to register your opinions on some of the issues I have covered here. BIS Review 4/1997

In December  according to the business leaders surveyed by the Banque de France  industrial activity increased in all sectors  except in the intermediate goods sector  where it remained stable. The food processing and consumer goods sectors were the most buoyant. The capacity utilization rate remained virtually unchanged. Overall demand firmed on both the domestic market and the export market  where the strongest flow of orders continued to come from the United States and Asia. The competitiveness of French products was bolstered by the recovery of currencies that had weakened earlier  including the United States dollar  sterling and the Italian lira. Order books approached normal levels in all sectors  except in the intermediate goods sector  where they remained too low. Inventories decreased with the end of the lorry drivers’ strike  and now appear to be normal in the capital goods and automobile sectors. In the coming months  most sectors are expected to continue to show moderate growth. Commodity prices as a whole showed practically no change. Finished product prices held up overall  despite the continuing high level of competition. Investment programmes were limited to renewing obsolete equipment or to meeting the desire to increase firms’ productivity in an intensely competitive international environment. There were few plans for output capacity increases and in all cases were dependent on stronger growth in demand. Retail sales in November and December posted a slight decline compared with the corresponding period of 1995. Activity in the construction sector fell back in the fourth quarter and posted a sharp twelve-month drop. Employment levels varied little in industry  with the exception of the automobile sector  where they posted a further substantial decline. They remained stable in the market services and retail sectors  but fell sharply in the building industry. BIS Review 4/1997

Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee  I am pleased to appear here today. In just a few weeks the Federal Reserve Board will submit its semiannual report on monetary policy to the Congress. That report and my accompanying testimony will cover in detail our assessment of the outlook for the U.S. economy and the challenges facing monetary policy. This morning  I would like to offer some personal perspectives on the current economic situation. I think it is fair to say that the overall performance of the U.S. economy has continued to surpass most forecasters’ expectations. The current cyclical upswing is now approaching six years in duration  and the economy has retained considerable vigor  with few signs of the imbalances and inflationary tensions that have disrupted past expansions. Although the data for the fourth quarter are still incomplete  it is apparent that real gross domestic product posted an increase in the neighborhood of 3 percent over the four quarters of 1996. This increase may seem quite moderate compared with the gains registered in some earlier years of the postwar period; however  at a time when the working-age population is expanding relatively slowly and unemployment is already low  this economic growth is appreciable indeed. It was enough to generate more than 2½ million new payroll jobs last year and to cause the unemployment rate to edge down to 5¼ percent -- a figure roughly matching the low of the last cyclical upswing  in the late 1980s. But  in contrast to that earlier period  we have not experienced a broad increase in inflation; in fact  by some important measures of price trends  inflation actually slowed a bit in 1996. The balance and solidity of the expansion last year can be seen in the composition of the growth. Notably  consumers appear to have been rather conservative in their spending. In some instances  they may have been constrained by the debt-service burdens accumulated over the previous few years; but in the aggregate  households experienced an enormous further accretion of net worth as the stock market continued to climb at a breathtaking rate. Judging from historical patterns  such an increase in wealth might have inspired households to spend an enlarged share of their current income; but  if we take the available data at face value  households appear instead to have set aside a greater share of their income for financial investment. Perhaps Americans are finally becoming conscious of the need to accumulate additional assets to ensure not only that they can handle temporary interruptions in employment but also that they will have the wherewithal to enjoy a lengthy retirement down the road. Be that as it may  the increased flow of private savings -- and a reduced call upon those savings by the Treasury -- helped to fund substantial increases in fixed investment last year. Homebuilding activity was up considerably; notably  single-family housing starts were robust once again and helped to push the nation’s homeownership rate to a fifteen-year high. In addition  business fixed investment posted another strong advance. Firms acquired large amounts of computing and telecommunications equipment in particular  seeking to enhance the efficiency of their operations as well as their overall productive capacity. At the same time  they accumulated inventories rather cautiously: Stock-to-sales ratios  which had risen in 1995  were in many cases near historic lows as of November 1996  the most recent month for which statistical information is available. The growing economy had beneficial effects on the finances of many states and localities  which consequently could spend more on needed infrastructure and vital services and  BIS Review 5/1997 - 2 - in some instances  trim taxes. Of course  overall government sector purchases were held down by the ongoing efforts to reduce the federal deficit. It clearly was private demand that drove economic growth last year. To be more specific  it was domestic private demand that did so  for net exports fell  on balance  in 1996. The volume of goods and services we sold abroad grew appreciably  despite moderate economic expansion by our major trading partners  but our imports continued to grow at a rapid clip. In fact  imports provided a safety valve in a U.S. economy marked by a high degree of resource utilization. I’ve already noted that our unemployment rate reached the lowest level in some time. Moreover  throughout the year  we heard reports from around the country that qualified workers were in tight supply. Although increases in hourly compensation remained relatively subdued -- an important fact to which I shall return in a few moments -- they did become more sizable  and they raised unit costs when employers were unable to enhance productivity commensurately. Thanks to the very substantial additions to facilities in the past few years  physical capacity in the manufacturing sector was not greatly strained. The question is  of course  where do we go from here? Can we continue to achieve significant gains in real activity while avoiding inflationary excesses? Because monetary policy works with a lag  it is not the conditions prevailing today that are critical but rather those likely to prevail six to twelve months  or even longer  from now. Hence  as difficult as it is  we must arrive at some judgment about the most probable direction of the economy and the distribution of risks around that expectation. Fortunately  economic events are not wholly random and unforecastable. There are certain principles  and certain empirical regularities in behavioral relations  that we can follow with some degree of confidence. For example  capital investment responds in a predictable way to the rate of growth of the economy  expected profitability  and the cost of capital. Similarly  housing activity  with some qualifications  moves inversely with mortgage rates. And the largest component of final demand  personal consumption expenditures  generally follows income over time. Many of these relationships are embedded in the traditional notion of the business cycle developed by Wesley Clair Mitchell three-quarters of a century ago and worked out with Arthur F. Burns  one of my predecessors  in the definitive tome  Measuring Business Cycles. Their insights remain relevant today. Even so  each cycle tends to have its own identifying characteristic. For example  in the late 1980s and the recessionary period of the early 1990s  the economy was dominated by the sharp fall in the market value of commercial real estate; because such real estate served as a major source of loan collateral  the drop in its value had a profoundly restrictive influence on the willingness and ability of commercial banks to lend. As you may recall  at that time  I characterized the economy as trying to advance in the face of fifty-mile-an-hour headwinds. The severe credit restraint was only grudgingly responsive to the extended efforts of the Federal Reserve to ease monetary conditions. Similarly  the dramatic rise of inflation and of inflation expectations in the 1970s was key in shaping the cyclical patterns of that period. One manifestation was the impetus to spending on houses  cars  and other consumer durables from buyers’ efforts to beat future price increases. Countering this inflation required a major monetary tightening  which moved both nominal and real interest rates up sharply and led to substantial contractions in housing and other interest-sensitive sectors in the early 1980s. BIS Review 5/1997 - 3 - In contrast  as I’ve mentioned several times to the Congress over the past few years  perhaps the dominant characteristic of the current expansion is low inflation and quiescent inflation expectations  which have helped create a financial environment conducive to strong capital spending and longer-range planning generally. I emphasized this point in our Humphrey- Hawkins testimony of a year ago. Since then  increases in hourly compensation as measured by the employment cost index have continued to fall far short of what they would have been had historical relationships between compensation gains and the degree of labor market tightness held. Reaching some judgment about the reasons for this departure from past patterns is important. As I see it  heightened job insecurity explains a significant part of the restraint on compensation and the consequent muted price inflation. Surveys of workers have highlighted this extraordinary state of affairs. In 1991  at the bottom of the recession  a survey of workers at large firms indicated that 25 percent feared being laid off. In 1996  despite the sharply lower unemployment rate and the demonstrably tighter labor market  the same survey organization found that 46 percent were fearful of a job layoff. The continued reluctance of workers to leave their jobs to seek other employment as the labor market has tightened provides further evidence of such concern  as does the tendency toward longer labor union contracts. For many decades  contracts rarely exceeded three years. Today  one can point to five- and six-year contracts -- contracts that are commonly characterized by an emphasis on job security and that involve only modest wage increases. The low level of work stoppages of recent years also attests to concern about job security. Thus  the willingness of workers to trade off smaller increases in wages for greater job security seems to be reasonably well-documented for this particular business-cycle expansion. The unanswered question is why this insecurity has persisted even as the labor market has  by all objective measures  tightened considerably. One possibility is the ongoing concern of workers about job skill obsolescence. The reality of this obsolescence is evidenced by the marked expansion of on-the-job training programs  especially in technical areas  in many of the nation’s corporations. No longer can one expect to obtain all of one’s lifetime job skills with a high-school or college diploma. Indeed  continuing adult education is perceived to be increasingly necessary to retain a job. Certainly  there are other possible explanations of the softness in compensation growth in the past few years. The sharp deceleration in health care costs  of course  is cited frequently. Another possibility is the heightened pressure on firms and their workers in industries that compete internationally. Domestic deregulation has had similar effects on the intensity of competitive forces in some industries. In addition  the continued decline in the share of the private workforce in labor unions has likely made wages more responsive to market forces -- indeed  the converse is also true in that the new competitive realities have in many instances undermined union strength. In any event  although I do not doubt that all these explanations are relevant  I would be surprised if any were dominant. Another potential explanation is that persistently is constraining wage increases. Historical evidence clearly indicates that price inflation is a factor in wage change. But  if the causation is running mainly from product markets  where prices are set  to labor markets  where wages are set  then we would expect to see some squeeze on profit margins. Clearly  this is not the case at present. Rather  owing in part to the subdued behavior of low price inflation BIS Review 5/1997 - 4 - wages  profits and rates of return on capital have risen to high levels. The high rates of return  in turn  seem to be inducing competitive pressures that limit the ability of firms to raise prices relative to their underlying cost structures because they fear that competitors anxious to capture a greater share of the market will not follow suit. Thus  the evidence seems more consistent with the view that wage restraint is damping price increases than the other way around. If the job insecurity paradigm that I have outlined is the key  then we must recognize that  as I indicated in last February’s Humphrey-Hawkins testimony  “suppressed wage cost growth as a consequence of job insecurity can be carried only so far. At some point in the future  the trade-off of subdued wage growth for job security has to come to an end.” In short  this implies that even if the level of real wages remains permanently lower as a result of the experience of the past few years  the relatively modest wage gains we’ve seen are a transitional rather than a lasting phenomenon. The unknown is how long the transition will last. Indeed  the recent pickup in some measures of wages suggests that the transition may already be running its course. If so  the important question from a monetary policy point of view is whether prospective labor market conditions will be consistent with the maintenance of satisfactory price performance. I would like to conclude with a brief discussion of some issues of measurement and economic data that may be useful as you begin your deliberations on the 1998 budget. One issue you will have to grapple with is the growing consensus that the consumer price index -- and other broad price measures that rely heavily on CPI data in their construction -- are substantially overstating changes in the true cost of living. From your perspective  one important implication of the CPI bias is that it creates an automatic and presumably unintended real increase in social security and other indexed federal benefits and a real cut in indexed individual income taxes each year. Less widely recognized is the fact that  for a given level of nominal spending  the upward bias in the CPI in many cases is mirrored in a downward bias in estimates of real spending; this muddies the interpretation of both recent economic developments and longer-run trends in our economic performance. Several researchers have attempted to quantify the bias in the CPI and other broad measures of prices. One set of studies has examined the detailed microstatistical evidence on price measurement. The Boskin Commission drew heavily on these studies and concluded that the CPI is currently overstating changes in the true cost of living by approximately 1 percentage point per year. In addition to some technical factors associated with its construction  the CPI overstates inflation because of the slow introduction of new products and inadequate adjustment for quality improvements. Recently  researchers at the Federal Reserve Board have looked at the measurement issue from a macroeconomic perspective. This analysis  which questions whether the pattern implied by the published price  output  and productivity statistics makes sense  also suggests that the inflation rate is overstated. In particular  the research finds that measured real output and productivity in the service sector of the economy are implausibly weak  given that the return to the owners of these businesses that is implicit in our aggregate statistics on GDP apparently has been well-maintained. The published data indicate that the level of output per hour in several service-producing industries has been falling for more than two decades -- that is  that firms in these industries have been getting less and less efficient for more than twenty years. This pattern is highly unlikely. Price mismeasurement seems to be the most probable explanation of the data anomalies  and the order of magnitude appears consistent with the microstatistical results. BIS Review 5/1997 - 5 - The evidence that inflation has been slower and that real growth has been faster than the official measures indicate is welcome  in part because it suggests that the nation’s current level of economic well-being is higher than we had thought. But I want to make clear that revising our historical estimates of real growth to incorporate better price data would have no material effect on measures of the degree of resource utilization  because such a revision implies faster growth in potential output  as well as actual output; accordingly  it does not alter the relationship between resource utilization and inflation. Nor does it change the outlook for the federal budget deficit  apart from any modifications to the indexing formulas for entitlements and income taxes. Certainly  the judgment that aggregate productivity has been growing faster than indicated by the official statistics seems reasonable in light of the significant business restructurings and extraordinary improvements in technology in recent years. I do not mean to imply  however  that we should assume that the full productivity gain from information technology has already been reaped. Clearly  it takes some time for firms to adopt production techniques that translate a major new technology into increased output. In an intriguing parallel  electric motors in the late nineteenth century were well-known as a technology but were initially integrated into production systems that were designed for steam-driven power plants. Not until the gradual conversion of previously vertical factories into horizontal facilities  mainly in the 1920s  were firms able to take full advantage of the synergies implicit in the electric dynamo and thus achieve dramatic increases in productivity. Analogously  not all of today’s production systems can be easily integrated with new information and communication technologies. Some existing equipment cannot be controlled by computer  for example. Thus  the full exploitation of even the current generation of information and communication equipment may occur over quite a few years and only after a considerably updated stock of physical capital has been put in place. While such a scenario is quite plausible  we cannot be certain when  or if  it will occur. Thus  we must be vigilant to ensure that our economy remains sufficiently flexible for entrepreneurial initiatives. And we must continue our efforts to further enhance productivity growth by raising national saving and spurring capital formation. Attaining a higher national saving rate quite soon is crucial  particularly in view of the anticipated shift in the nation’s demographics and associated pressures on federal retirement and health programs in the first few decades of the next century. Reducing the size of the federal budget deficit  and over time moving the unified budget into surplus  would go a substantial way in that direction. BIS Review 5/1997

George  at the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland Biennial Dinner in Edinburgh on 20/1/97.,Mr. George assesses how sustainable the current rate of growth of the UK economy is Speech given by the Governor of the Bank of England  Mr. E.A.J. George  at the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland Biennial Dinner in Edinburgh on 20/1/97. Mr. Chairman  the last time we came together for this great occasion  two years ago  I was pleased to be able to report to you that the British economy was making encouraging progress. We had  already then  seen very nearly three years of continuous and reasonably steady economic growth  which had produced a gradual fall in unemployment. And this steady expansion had brought few of the usual tell-tale signs of emerging imbalance between overall demand in the economy and our supply-side capacity to meet that demand. Our external current account was close to balance. And underlying retail price inflation was then lower than it had been for a generation. Even so  we had - as you will recall - begun to apply a touch on the monetary policy tiller to avoid being blown off course by rising world commodity prices at a time when domestic activity had already gathered pace. I am delighted to be with you again this evening and to be able to report that this encouraging progress continues. Output has now been growing  continuously and reasonably steadily - at an annual rate of 2.2% - for very nearly five years. Unemployment has continued to fall  almost without interruption month by month  and is now down to 1.9 million (or 6.7% of the workforce) compared with nearly 3 million (or 10.5%) at its peak  and 2.5 million (or 8.6%) two years ago. It is of course still intolerably high - we are talking about people here not just numbers. But unemployment is at least a great deal lower than in any other major country in Europe; and it is falling in the UK whereas elsewhere it is all too often still rising. Our external current account remains close to balance. And although our rate of inflation has edged up since we were last together  from below 2½% to just over 3%  and is  it must be said  somewhat higher than in most of the rest of the industrialised world  it is still relatively low by our own standards of the past 30-odd years. The key question now - as it was last time - is can we keep it going? Things have moved on over the past two years. We did in fact successfully weather the commodity price squall  which blew itself out quite quickly - though oil prices have recently been something of an exception. And the economy slowed during 1995. But we are now seeing a new and freshening wind blowing in particular from the household sector of the domestic economy. A sharp pick-up in the rate of growth of the money supply in 1995 provided an early indication that demand growth was likely to accelerate. And money supply growth has remained strong throughout the whole of the past year. Faster growth of consumer spending became evident in the first half of 1996 and has been sustained. And from the middle of last year this began to feed through into output - which was initially held back  and is possibly still being affected by a run-down of stocks. Now the fact is that no-one can tell you with any great confidence just when the increase in demand is likely to begin to create economic imbalance and spill over into rising inflation. But we can be reasonably certain that money supply growth at around 9-10% a year  as we have seen it now since the beginning of last year  and growth in consumer spending at nearly 4% a year  as we have seen over the last year  cannot be sustained for long consistently with the Government’s inflation target in the medium term. And there are signs - in the recently more rapid tightening of the labour market and in the gathering recovery in the housing market  for example  that demand may be strengthening. BIS Review 5/1997 - 2 - That  essentially  is why the Bank has been arguing that we will need at some early stage a modest pre-emptive tightening of monetary policy. It is true that there is no immediate sign of cost or price inflation at the early stages of the production-distribution chain; and it is true in particular that the tightening labour market has not yet resulted in an acceleration of pay settlements or earnings. But these are backward- looking data. If we are to maintain that happy position  we need to anticipate what is to come  and begin to moderate the pace of the upswing before the evidence of imbalance comes through into the statistics. Two years ago my message to you was that we needed a stitch in time to save nine  which indeed we did. I bring you the same message again this evening. The position is however complicated on this occasion by the recent strength of the exchange rate. Since the summer sterling has appreciated by just over 13% in effective terms - by rather more against the major European currencies and the yen (+15-16%) but rather less against the dollar (+7%). The speed and the size of sterling’s appreciation is  of course  causing understandable anxiety  particularly for those sectors of manufacturing industry exposed to international competition. Already this is beginning to affect export orders. Given that those sectors account for perhaps half of total manufacturing  which in turn accounts for nearly a quarter of total output  it is clearly a serious issue. This creates a tension between the domestic and the external  or exchange rate  dictates of policy - a dilemma which  in one direction or the other afflicts most countries from time to time  and which we ourselves have experienced at times in the past  though not during the past few years. The trouble in this instance is that the stronger exchange rate does not directly affect the build-up of domestic demand pressure  which is the problem we start with. It will  if it persists  have a one-off downwards effect (directly or indirectly) on the prices of perhaps a quarter of all goods covered by the retail price index  which will reduce the RPI during the course of this year; but this effect will gradually drop out of the 12-month calculation during 1998. The stronger exchange rate will also  if it persists  cause the external trade balance to weaken  and by relieving to this extent the pressure of overall demand  that may have a more lasting effect on the rate of inflation. We  of course  take these factors into account as best we can in making our forecasts of future inflation and in giving our policy advice  though there is inevitably a great deal of uncertainty over the timing and scale of their effects. That can  nevertheless  still leave room for tension between the need to moderate the upswing in domestic demand in order to meet the Government’s inflation target (of 2½% or less) not this year  but in 1998 and beyond on the one hand  and unwanted strength of the exchange rate on the other. There is no easy monetary policy answer to this dilemma. How far it persists depends upon just why the exchange rate suddenly strengthened as it has; and that is not easy to explain in terms of developments in the UK alone. Some of the suggested influences may well prove to be exaggerated or indeed reversible. This may be true  for example  of the rise in the oil price. It may be true  that expectations about a prospective relative rise in UK  and US  interest rates  reflecting the relative strength of our cyclical positions compared with those in Japan or continental Europe  are overdone  and they should in any event reduce as recovery takes hold in those other countries. And present market perceptions of the euro as a potentially weak currency if the Maastricht convergence criteria are not rigorously enforced  may also come to be seen to be exaggerated. There is in fact some suggestion  in currency options prices  that markets see a larger downside than upside risk to sterling against the DM in the course of this year. In the meantime  policy judgments are likely to remain unusually difficult. When we confronted a similar dilemma in the 1980s  the domestic expansion was allowed for some time to continue unchecked  but in the end we were driven to bring it to a jarring halt. I do not suggest for a moment that we are anywhere close to that situation now. Our aim is precisely to avoid that. But that experience does illustrate that  in the final analysis  there could be real dangers in allowing justified concern about the exchange rate to deflect us for too long from moving gradually to moderate the upswing. I emphasise the words “gradually” and “moderate”. The choice ultimately in this situation is not whether or not; it is sooner or later  less or more. BIS Review 5/1997 - 3 - Our present dilemma - and it is a real dilemma - serves to illuminate the debate about the economics pros and cons of European Monetary Union  and the difficult decisions that will face all EU countries in little over a year from now. On the one hand  the real attractions - to manufacturers in particular - of exchange rate fixity within the euro area  are amply apparent. On the other hand  our dilemma - and we are not alone in this dilemma within Europe - points up the problem that would arise if the single European monetary policy - the single interest rates - does not meet the domestic monetary policy needs of all the euro-member countries. This could happen for a number of reasons - related to different cyclical positions  different fiscal positions  or as a result of external shocks or structural changes. The famous Maastricht criteria for sustainable convergence that are to be met  according to the Treaty  before a country qualifies for the Single Currency were designed precisely to reduce the risks of tensions of this sort arising after the start. I should like to think that the political leaders across Europe  who will take the decisions  all really appreciate the crucial importance of sustainable convergence to the success of the venture and that they do not see it just as a technical obstacle to their wider aspirations - I should like to think that. So  Mr. Chairman  some difficult decisions lie ahead. The period up to your next biennial dinner will be momentous. But that should not obscure the fact that our immediate economic prospects remain encouraging. I do not know of any serious economic forecaster who does not expect the economy to continue to grow over the next two year  or unemployment to continue to fall. The challenge is to ensure that we can still say that in two years’ time. BIS Review 5/1997

Meyer  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the 99th Assembly for Bank Directors  Southwestern Graduate School of Banking  Westin Regina Resort  Puerto Vallarta  Mexico on 24/1/97. My topic this morning is financial modernization. Financial modernization today refers to legislative and regulatory reform to remove limitations on permissible activities for banking  securities  and other financial services firms. Financial modernization in the United States is sometimes used to refer specifically to the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act which limits banks’ involvement in security underwriting and dealing. I will use a broader interpretation that includes  in addition  the revision of the Bank Holding Company Act to allow banks to engage in insurance and other financial activities  the establishment of a two-way street that allows banks to affiliate with securities and insurance firms and insurance and security firms to affiliate with banks  a rationalization of the regulatory framework for banks and other financial services firms appropriate to the expanded powers and structural reforms  and at least a careful consideration of a common charter for commercial banks and thrift institutions and the mixing of banking and commerce. The financial services industry is moving in the direction of expanded activities and increased competition  with or without Congressional action  driven by market realities  financial innovations  technological change and global competition. Federal banking regulators are cooperating in this process  often reluctantly  but recognizing already existing erosions to regulations. Their ability to do so is often limited by statutory constraints  however  and  as a result  a clean and full rationalization of the structure of the financial services industry cannot be achieved without Congressional action. Nevertheless  what lies ahead is less a revolution than the completion of an ongoing process of financial market evolution. There are important disagreements about the breadth of expanded activities appropriate in banking organizations  the costs and benefits of structural restrictions to protect banks from added risks  and the appropriate regulatory framework for the reformed financial services industry. Nonetheless  I believe that policy makers have come to the conclusion that  while their hand may be forced by events  there are significant benefits from expanding the permissible activities of banks and other financial services firms. These benefits include increased competition in the financial services industry  and increased efficiency and consumer convenience in the provision of financial services. Allowing securities firms to compete directly with banks and banks with securities firms and each to compete with insurance firms will clearly enhance competition in the financial services industry. Economic theory and historical experience suggest that competition lowers costs  increases pressure for innovation  and increases attentiveness to the needs and convenience of customers. Financial modernization would allow financial services firms to serve better the needs and convenience of their customers both by lowering the costs of financial services and by facilitating one-stop shopping. The Edge Act already permits U.S. banks to compete on more equal terms outside the U.S. by permitting the Federal Reserve to authorize U.S. banks to do abroad certain activities  e.g.  securities underwriting and dealing  not authorized directly to U.S. banks in the U.S. Moreover  U.S. banks are consistently evaluated by foreigners as the most innovative in the world. Nonetheless  easing of regulations would enhance marginally the international competitiveness of U.S. banks. Financial modernization also promotes efficiency in the production of financial services by allowing increased diversification of income sources by BIS Review 6/1997 - 2 - financial services firms and by allowing such firms to take advantage of economies of scope  that is  efficiencies that arise from producing related products. Think of financial modernization as a puzzle involving domestic and foreign financial service providers and consumers  the permissible activities  the organizational structures  the safeguards  the regulators  the legislators  and the Administration. The Administration and the legislators  with input from the regulators  have to decide which activities go to which providers in what organizational structures subject to what safeguards  under the oversight of which regulators  all for the maximum benefit of consumers. It may not be quite as simple as it sounds! The providers are the institutions whose future hangs in the balance: thrifts  banks  and nonbank financial services firms. Banks and thrifts may be combined and thrifts may therefore not survive as a separate entity. And  once the legislation is passed  affiliations may occur across commercial banks  investment banks  and insurance firms. In any case  only a subset of providers would be allowed to participate in this game. For example  only banking institutions that were found to be well capitalized and well managed and had adequate internal controls would be allowed to engage in the expanded activities. This is part of the trend to incentive-based regulation in which expanded activities and more streamlined regulation are confined to banking firms whose strength and performance suggest they can handle the increased risk. The permissible activities include those that banks are currently allowed to engage in directly; the somewhat broader and evolving set of financial activities that bank holding companies have been allowed to engage in through their subsidiaries; additional activities that fill out the spectrum of financial activities; and finally  possibly  commercial activities. The choices for organizational structures include a universal banking model  where all activities are conducted inside the bank; the operating subsidiary model  favored by the Comptroller of the Currency  in which some activities are restricted to operating subsidiaries of banks; and the bank holding company model  the traditional preference of the Board of Governors  in which some activities are restricted to subsidiaries of the bank holding company. Safeguards refer to prudential limitations on activities between the bank and its subsidiaries (and affiliates) in order to protect the public from conflicts of interest and other abuses  but primarily to limit the risks to the bank from the activities in the subsidiaries as well as to limit the transfer of the subsidy inherent in the safety net to bank subsidiaries and affiliates. The most widely enforced prudential limitations are those associated with sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which limit financial transactions between a bank and its affiliates. Such transactions must be at arms-length and collateralized and  except for those collateralized by U.S. government securities  are subject to quantitative limits based on bank capital. In addition  banking regulators have sometimes imposed firewalls (including  for example  physical separation of banks and their affiliates and limitations on employee and director interlocks) to provide further protection and insulation of the bank from activities conducted by subsidiaries. The regulators include the three federal banking agencies (OCC for national banks  the FDIC for state nonmember banks  and the Federal Reserve for state member banks and all bank holding companies)  the OTS (the regulator of thrifts  other than credit unions)  and the regulators of nonbank financial services activities (e.g.  the SEC for securities and state insurance authorities for insurance). BIS Review 6/1997 - 3 - The legislators include the members of the House and Senate  with special focus on the Senate and House Banking Committees where financial modernization legislation will be written. The Administration effort is led by Treasury. Before I identify the key issues that have to be settled before the puzzle can be addressed  it will be useful to set the stage by explaining why banks are regulated. This will help motivate why bank activities have traditionally been restricted and why restrictions and prudential limitations are generally imposed when expanded activities are allowed in banking organizations. This will also help to motivate my subsequent discussion of the Board’s views on expanded power and structural restrictions. Two special characteristics of banking are critical to understanding why banks are regulated. First  banks have access to a government safety net through deposit insurance  the discount window  and payment system guarantees. Because deposit insurance can never be fully and accurately priced  it is necessary to monitor and sometimes to act to control bank risks in order to protect the potential call on taxpayers. The result is that banks are  in effect  subsidized by the government. This subsidy  in turn  creates incentives for banks to take more risk. That is  the safety net creates moral hazard incentives for risk-taking  because the safety net -- and potentially taxpayers -- may absorb most of the losses if the gamble fails. In effect  the incentive for the creditors of the bank to monitor banks’ risk taking -- the kind of monitoring that goes on for  say  finance companies -- and the market pressures to have high capital to absorb losses are simply blunted for entities with access to the safety net. That monitoring and pressure for capital has been taken over by the grantor of the safety net: the government. The second characteristic of banking is that banks -- especially large ones -- are capable of being the conduits of systemic risk and crisis in financial markets. A breakdown of the payments system or other contagion effect that hampers the ability of banks to intermediate credit flows could have serious consequences for the economy. The challenge is to maintain sufficient regulation to protect taxpayers  avoid unnecessary extensions of the safety net  and mitigate moral hazard incentives without undermining the competitiveness of the banking industry and its ability to take risk. Some have suggested that the government safety net  instead of being a subsidy to banks  has become a weight around their neck in the form of burdensome regulation that makes it difficult for banks to compete successfully against less regulated financial services firms. A solution might therefore be to limit or even eliminate the government safety net or at least charge deposit premiums that better price the risks involved. But the safety net has effectively eradicated the threat of runs on banks  has become capitalized in the value of bank equity  and in any case is so politically popular as to be unassailable. Our point of departure is therefore to assume that the government safety net will remain in place and will not be priced high enough to make it moot. Indeed  none of the legislative reform proposals in Congress would alter the access of banks to the government safety net. There will no doubt be continued efforts to reduce the net subsidy of the safety net. In addition to efforts to price insurance and access to central bank credit and the payments system more “accurately ” I anticipate that the government will continue other efforts. For example  I think the correct way to read prompt corrective action and high capital requirements is as an offset to safety net incentives that create moral hazards. BIS Review 6/1997 - 4 - More generally  we can discern five regulatory approaches that traditionally have been employed to limit the extension of the subsidy  control moral hazard incentives  and limit the risk to the taxpayer associated with access by banks to the government safety net. First  banks can be required to hold enough capital in relation to risks so that moral hazard incentives are minimized. Second  supervision and examination of banks by their regulators can insure that banking organizations maintain effective internal controls and implement an effective risk management process so that the safety and soundness of banks is protected and the risk to taxpayers minimized. Third  banks can be restricted to activities that do not present undue risks. Fourth  banking organizations can be required to conduct their riskier activities outside the bank itself  so that the bank is insulated from those greater risks. Fifth  prudential limitations can be enforced to reduce the prospect that transactions between the banks and their affiliates housing riskier activities could threaten the safety and soundness of banks. Financial modernization represents a reconsideration of these regulatory approaches in the context of reform intended to reduce the segmentation of the financial services industry and increase competition. The regulatory approach to maintaining the safety and soundness of banks has evolved over the period beginning from the banking and financial market reforms of the Great Depression era through today. From the 1930s through most of the 1970s  regulators focused on keeping the banking industry safe and sound by insulating banks from competition and limiting the activities in which they could compete. As a result  the financial services industry became highly segmented into separate entities providing commercial banking  investment banking  insurance services  etc. By the late 1970s  the changed economic environment along with advances in technology  financial innovation  and globalization were presenting U.S. banks with increased competition from not only foreign banks  but from domestic thrifts  nondepository financial institutions  and the securities market as well. Banks responded by replacing lost business and lower margins with expanded off-balance sheet activities such as securitization  back-up lines of credit and guarantees  and derivatives. These responses helped banks to substitute fee and trading income for some of the interest income lost through competition with other financial intermediaries. Moreover  the larger banks generally sought expanded securities powers  so that they could stem the loss of customer business to capital markets. Regulators responded by reducing  in so far as they could under the law  the regulatory limits on banks and creating a more level playing field for banks and nonbanking firms. Financial modernization would further advance this process that has already blurred the distinction among financial services firms. Next the puzzle of powers  structures  and regulators must be solved. We need some guiding principles. The primary standard by which all modifications should be measured is the benefit to consumers of financial services. Would it make such services cheaper  more easily available  more convenient? Would it facilitate and foster innovation and competition? Modernization reforms that only increase provider profits -- say  by eliminating outdated and costly regulation -- are desirable  but only if  at a minimum  they do not reduce competition and consumer service. Given that primary principle  a second standard is to rely  in so far as compatible with the other goals  on the market. Thus  within such constraints  the scope of financial activities of banking organizations should be decided by the organizations themselves. When the special nature of banking makes reliance on the market impossible  the regulator should try to simulate market responses. Prompt corrective action is an example. BIS Review 6/1997 - 5 - Third  we should not lose sight of the special characteristics of banking that dictate regulation. These continue to suggest that there must be appropriate capital requirements  structure  supervision  and examination in banking organizations. Fourth  at the same time  the regulatory framework for financial services should be simplified and refined. In resolving the key regulatory issues  we should address three questions: First  what expanded activities should banks be allowed to conduct? Second  what organizational restrictions  if any  should be imposed on these new activities? The task here is to balance the benefits from achieving potential synergies among related activities and efficiencies from diversification and economies of scope  on the one hand  with the need to protect the safety net  that is  the taxpayer  on the other. Third  what regulatory framework most appropriately accommodates expanded activities  while also adequately protecting the safety and soundness of banks  controlling systemic risk  and promoting effective monetary policy? I will outline the key issues each question raises  beginning in each case with the Board’s position. Activities The discussion of expanded activities centers really on securities and insurance. I will therefore begin by setting out the current limitations on such activities in banking organizations  explain the Board’s position on expanded powers  and then turn to unsettled substantive issues. The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 prohibits banks from underwriting or dealing in securities  with the exceptions of U.S. government and agency issues  and municipal general obligation bonds. Nonbank affiliates of Federal Reserve member banks are also prohibited from being “principally engaged” in underwriting or dealing in non-exempt securities. Since 1987  the Board has allowed member banks to conduct limited non-exempt securities activities through subsidiaries of a bank holding company  referred to as section 20 affiliates  because section 20 of Glass-Steagall prohibited affiliation on the “principally engaged” criterion. In the 1980s  the Board initially determined that an affiliate was not “principally engaged” in prohibited activities if no more than 5% of its revenues came from non-exempt sources. That limit was subsequently raised to 10%  and in December of 1996  the Board expanded the non-exempt revenue limit to 25%. Most major U.S. banks  I might add  have had experience in securities activities through their foreign affiliates. Most of these foreign activities  in turn  are conducted  subject to certain percentage and dollar limitations  through their Edge corporations  which are generally subsidiaries of the bank. By statute  Edge corporations are permitted to engage in activities abroad not permitted in the U.S. if necessary to compete on an equal basis with local rivals. The Board has concluded that eligible securities activities  section 20 experience with ineligible securities  and activities through Edge corporations  have provided banks with considerable experience with securities activities. In addition  banks have been permitted to conduct private placements  provide discount and full service brokerage services  offer financial advisory services  and broker proprietary mutual funds. The repeal of the statutory limitation on securities activities by a bank affiliate would only extend an already significant presence of banks in securities activities and build upon a base of existing experience. In addition  it would provide increased competition without -- by the record -- increasing bank risks significantly. Moreover  the Glass-Steagall restrictions on securities activities were motivated by concern that abuses of such powers had contributed to the banking crises of the great Depression era. Subsequent BIS Review 6/1997 - 6 - research  however  has found that these concerns were greatly exaggerated and that there was no evidence that abuses in securities activities played a significant role in the banking crisis. As a result  there is little controversy about the merits of repeal of Glass Steagall. Bank holding companies have been prohibited from insurance sales and underwriting since 1982  although existing activities were grandfathered. National banks located towns with a population of 5000 or less are allowed to serve as a general insurance agent. The Comptroller  supported by recent court decisions  has allowed such banks to engage in national sales from offices located in such towns. A number of states allow banks they charter to engage in insurance agency activities quite broadly. At the same time  the FDIC Improvement Act in 1991 prohibits state banks insured by the FDIC from engaging in underwriting insurance beyond the extent permitted for national banks. As a result  banks are gaining some experience in insurance agency activities  but have quite limited experience with insurance underwriting activities. Nonetheless  there is a growing consensus that selling all types of insurance and possibly underwriting life insurance would not present undue risks to banks and would benefit consumers. It is important to note that securities and insurance activities are the only financial activities prohibited to banking organizations by statute. With the exceptions perhaps of property and casualty insurance  both activities seem to reflect manageable risks for banks. Consequently both activities would seem compatible with present organizational structures and prudential limitations. Indeed  the diversification of income sources might suggest that the extension of activities to include securities and insurance activities could  on balance  reduce the overall riskiness of the consolidated enterprise. However  commercial activities raise greater concerns. Think of a continuum of powers  including those currently permissible for banks and those under consideration with a ranking from low to greater risk. Where do securities underwriting and dealing and insurance agency and underwriting fall on this spectrum? While the answer may not be clear  I think that it is fair to argue that brokering  underwriting  and dealing in life insurance or securities are generally less risky than most of the credit risks banks have taken with their traditional lending activities. As we have seen in recent years with commercial real estate  energy  agricultural  and developing country loans  lending is hardly risk-free. Securities and insurance brokerage  in contrast  contain little risk  per se  and with their reliance on actuarial tables  life insurance underwriting activities would seem to present risks that banks could easily manage and control. Underwriting of casualty and property insurance  might  however  be beyond the higher end of the current risk spectrum. The Board of Governors has supported both a repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act to permit banking organizations to underwrite and deal in securities and also a reform of the Bank Holding Company Act to permit banks broader powers regarding insurance brokerage and underwriting. The possible exception involves casualty and property underwriting  which the Board historically has felt raised concerns about risk. The Board has not  however  supported affiliations between banking and commercial firms. While it does not object in principle to such affiliations  it has taken the position that it is perhaps best for banking organizations and their regulators to gain experience with new financial activities before considering broader combinations. The benefits simply appear less certain and the risks greater. The Board would therefore prefer to proceed with the expansion in financial services and to defer any discussion of commercial activities. Admittedly  such an approach could complicate the modernization process  since some unitary thrifts and insurance firms are already affiliated with commercial firms. Would they BIS Review 6/1997 - 7 - need to divest such activities  or could they be satisfactorily grandfathered if either the thrift and bank charters are combined or banks are permitted to affiliate with securities and insurance firms? Organizational Structure The Board’s position has been that any meaningful expansion of new activities should take place in nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies. In contrast  the Comptroller of the Currency has proposed allowing such activities in subsidiaries of national banks. Some have viewed this difference as simply a battle over turf. The Federal Reserve supervises bank holding companies and would therefore expand its regulatory reach if new powers were forced into the BHC model. The OCC supervises national banks and would potentially expand its influence relative to the Federal Reserve if nonbank activities were permitted in operating subsidiaries of banks. But much more is at stake here than turf. The location in the organizational structure of nonbanking activities raises fundamental questions about the safety net. Recall my earlier comments about the fundamental tension between risk-taking and market orientation  on the one hand  and the stabilization and moral hazard implications of the safety net  on the other. Such tensions focus  I submit  on the special benefits -- the subsidy  if you will -- that recipients of the safety net receive and the regulation that goes with it. We in the United States should be careful not to inadvertently extend the safety net -- and  almost for certain  bank-like regulations -- in the process of dealing with financial reform and organizational structure. This is a difficult issue  requiring balance and judgment  and I would hope that Congress would carefully review the options and their full implications. Regulatory Framework Currently  all bank holding companies are subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve; banks are regulated by state banking agencies  the OCC  the FDIC  and/or the Federal Reserve depending on their charter  and  for state banks  on their choice  and there is some functional regulation of specialized activities of holding company subsidiaries. Consolidated bank holding company supervision includes holding company capital requirements  examinations  and reporting requirements. Two substantive issues are important as we consider the regulatory framework most appropriate for accommodating financial modernization. First  to what degree is consolidated supervision and regulation appropriate? Second  what role should the Federal Reserve have in regulating banks and financial conglomerates that include banks? Both the operating subsidiary and bank holding company models facilitate functional regulation by putting specialized activities that might be subject to functional regulation into separate entities. For example  securities activities subject to SEC capital requirements and other regulations would be put into a separate subsidiary and similarly with insurance activities subject to regulation by state insurance departments. Under a pure functional regulation scheme  bank regulators would supervise only the bank  and there would be no consolidated supervision of the entire entity. This appears  on the surface  clean and efficient  reflecting the benefits of specialization and division of labor among regulators. But it is completely out of step with emerging risk management practices at financial services firms and with norms for global banks and financial services firms around the world. BIS Review 6/1997 - 8 - Banking organizations are increasingly managing risks without regard to legal entities. For them to do otherwise would ignore the powerful concepts of portfolio theory and the gains they can achieve both from diversification and from managing risks on a consolidated basis. If financial services firms engage in consolidated risk management  regulators must insist on some measure of consolidated regulation that permits effective oversight of the consolidated entity. The U.S. participates actively in world forums with regulators of banking and other financial services. There is a growing emphasis in these meetings on sharing information and clear recognition of the value of consolidated supervision. If there is consolidated regulation  it could be carried out by the Federal Reserve  in line with the system’s current role as regulator of bank holding companies. For example under Congressman Leach’s bill  the Federal Reserve would be the umbrella regulator for the financial services holding companies that replace bank holding companies. An alternative model  however  might be for the regulator of the lead bank to be the umbrella regulator of the consolidated entity. That approach has the advantage of limiting the number of separate regulators of a given entity. It has the disadvantage  though  that the regulation of financial services holding companies would be disbursed among several agencies and that each agency could adopt different policies. A third model would have a single bank regulator for financial services holding companies whose predominant activity is banking and the SEC where the predominant activity involves securities. The second issue is what role the Federal Reserve should have in banking regulation. You may recall that the Administration proposed in 1993 a consolidation of banking regulation that would have taken all regulatory  supervisory  and examination responsibilities away from the Federal Reserve and consolidated the current responsibilities of the OCC  and the supervisory and regulatory responsibilities of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve into a new federal banking commission. The Federal Reserve opposed consolidated supervision and regulation and strongly asserted the importance of maintaining a hands-on supervisory role for the Federal Reserve. That role is especially critical for large  global banking organizations  but also for at least a cross section of smaller banks. The Federal Reserve believes that such an active supervisory role is essential for it to conduct monetary policy and prevent or manage financial crises most effectively. For example  the information examiners developed about the severity of the credit crunch in the early 1990s contributed to the Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain an unusually stimulative monetary policy well into the current expansion. That policy  in turn  helped to support the economy while banking institutions were returning to health and reestablishing their ability to provide credit to support a healthy expansion. As the nation’s central bank  the Federal Reserve also has critical responsibilities to prevent or resolve major problems in financial markets that cannot be adequately met without timely and in-depth knowledge of the operating practices  risk-management procedures  and financial exposures of the banking system. In conclusion  the case for expanded financial activities for banks and other financial services firms is compelling. But it is important that differences in opinion about structural and prudential safeguards and the resulting regulatory framework be resolved  so that these disagreements do not block financial modernization efforts.

Hannoun discusses issues relating to financial markets and European Monetary Union Article by M. Hervé Hannoun1  a Deputy Governor of the Bank of France  published in the autumn 1996 issue of “revue d’économie financière no. 38”. What impact will Monetary Union have on the financial markets? I should preface any attempt to answer that question by saying that the financial markets have already been affected by Monetary Union  even though 1 January 1999 is still in the future. The interest rates on the French-franc market for maturities of 3  5  10 and 30 years already incorporate 1  3  8 and 28 years in euro. this means that medium-term market rates for the French franc already depend on the soundness and the credibility of the euro. The first part of this article will deal with the changeover of the markets to the euro on 1 January 1999. The second part will discuss the more strategic issue of the new environment that will affect the leading European financial markets as a result of Monetary Union. 1. The technical preparations for the 1999 changeover of the markets to the euro are already well under way. 1.1. The Options Chosen 1.1.1. A Two-Stage Scenario The scenario adopted comprises two stages  with the changeover in wholesale transactions occurring in the first and the changeover in retail operations in the second. The changeover in the financial markets will occur rapidly because  starting on 1 January 1999  the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) will conduct its monetary policy in euro and the Monetary Union Member States will denominate their new government securities issues in euro. Then  by 1 January 2002  at the latest  when the euro bank notes and coins have been introduced and general government agencies have made the changeover to the euro  all retail banking activities will be conducted in euro. During the transitional period from 1999 to 2002  banks will be on the frontier between two spheres  with the euro-denominated markets on one side  and the world of retail transactions  where national currencies will continue to be used  on the other. At the place where the two spheres meet and overlap  banks will play the vital role of interface  making them an important driving force in the changeover of the markets to the euro. Converters will enable banks to meet the demand for euro from non-financial agents and let them integrate transactions on markets where the quotation  trading and settlement systems all operate in euro  into an economy where the national currency is bound to remain in widespread use. The converters will be located in the financial institutions. 1.1.2. The changeover will occur on 1 January 1999 for flows in the financial markets. It will be more gradual for the outstanding stock of securities and transactions. The objective of the Paris banking and financial community is for all of the markets to change over 1 This article was written with the help of Denis Beau  the head of the French-franc trading room and Yves Nachbaur  Deputy Manager of the Financial Markets Division. BIS Review 7/1997 - 2 - to the euro completely and for good on 1 January 1999. This applies to the foreign exchange  money  bond and equity markets. However  we must make a distinction between the flows  which are the market transactions  and the stock of outstanding securities and market instruments exchanged in these transactions or underlying them. The diagram below shows that the changeover in terms of flows will be complete and immediate  whereas technical considerations will make the changeover in terms of stock more gradual and  in some cases  the pace of the changeover may differ. The Changeover of the Markets to the Euro Markets Foreign Exchange Market Flows (transactions) Euro (1/1/1999) Stock (instruments) Euro Quotes Trading Immediate conversion of outstanding currency swaps  options and futures Money Market Euro (1/1/1999) Euro Quotes Trading Automatic denominated securities conversion of Ecu- Rapid conversion of outstanding French-franc securities and repos into euro New government securities issues in euro Bond Market Euro (1/1/1999) Quotes Trading Euro/Franc conversion Automatic denominated bonds of Ecu- Conversion of outstanding government bonds at the start of Stage 3 Gradual conversion of outstanding private-sector bonds New government bonds issued in euro Equity Market Euro (1/1/1999) Euro Quotes Trading Conversion of par values into euro on 1/1/2002 1.2. The Impact of the Changeover on the Ways Markets Work 1.2.1. The Foreign Exchange Market The foreign exchange markets are set to change over to the euro on 4 January 1999. In practical terms  this means that non-euro-area currencies will be quoted against the euro exclusively. BIS Review 7/1997 - 3 - Currency rates on the euro market could be quoted quite naturally as rates against the euro to ensure continuity with practices on the Ecu market  where the rates for all currencies  including sterling  are quoted as rates against the Ecu. At the same time  the institutions’ foreign exchange holdings of euro-area currencies must be converted into the single currency and settlements arising from the interbank foreign exchange market will be made in euro. Market professionals’ open interest in swaps  futures and options on euro-area currencies will automatically be converted  with the substitution of the euro for the national currencies of the euro area countries. The immediate changeover of the foreign exchange market will call for some operating rules to be worked out by 1 January 1999. Such rules should cover such matters as the way benchmark exchange rates are worked out. The Banque de France publishes daily benchmark rates for the franc against various other currencies. These rates are often used for valuation for tax  accounting and prudential purposes. Benchmark rates will still be needed after 1 January 1999 to give the euro price of non-euro-area currencies. We must make sure we know how this need will be met. Rules must also be defined to harmonize value dates. The creation of a unified foreign exchange market for the whole euro area will be an incentive for such harmonization. Other rules will be needed for dealing with open interest in currency futures and swaps on currencies from the countries entering Monetary Union. By 31 December 1998 at the latest  the final value of such contracts will be known for certain  and a cash settlement price can then be worked out on the basis of the difference between the rate originally contracted and the irrevocably-fixed conversion rate that is ultimately set. The questions that then arise are whether contracts should be liquidated early or whether they should continue to run until their originally agreed maturities. These are the kinds of questions that the working groups are studying at the moment. 1.2.2. Interest-Rate Markets The changeover to the euro on 1 January 1999 will not raise any problems for quotes on interest-rate markets  because they are given as rates or percentages of par values. Cash settlements arising from delivery-versus-payment securities transactions will be made exclusively in euro in the RGV and RELIT securities settlement systems. The Money Market The changeover in the money market should occur quickly for transactions in the interbank  negotiable debt securities and repo segments. On the interbank market  the changeover will be facilitated because  starting on 1 January 1999  monetary policy transactions will be conducted in euro  the banks’ accounts with the central banks will be held exclusively in euro and the large-value payment systems will operate in euro. The TARGET system  which will handle all monetary policy operations and many interbank payments  will be operational and should ensure perfectly smooth circulation of central money  thus enhancing the effectiveness of the changeover process. BIS Review 7/1997 - 4 - On negotiable debt securities market  the outstanding government bonds will be converted into euro immediately. The technical process of converting other debt securities will be facilitated by the fact that most of them are short-term securities issued or held by credit institutions. Nevertheless  the participants in these markets must define the technical procedures for converting securities of all maturities into euro so that they can be used as instruments in a broader euro money market. The repo market could  of course  operate in euro with securities denominated in francs at first. But outstanding repos must be converted into euro rapidly in 1999 so as to constitute a uniform euro money market in which the expertise and experience of operators in Paris should give them an important role. The Bond Market The technical problems involved in the changeover of the bond market are a more delicate matter. New State bonded debt will be issued in euro starting on 1 January 1999  and the French treasury has committed itself to converting its outstanding bonds into euro as soon as possible. This is bound to create a very favourable volume effect  but the conversion of other outstanding bond issues may occur more gradually. One of the difficulties arising in the changeover in bonds is how to convert par values. Because bonds carry set denominations  the conversion of par values raises the problem of rounding and fractional values. For example  how should a 2 000-franc OAT bond be converted into a euro-denominated bond  and what should the new denomination be  as the franc/euro conversion rate is unlikely to produce a whole number. One solution under consideration is to create bonds with a par value of one euro each. The feasibility of this solution is under study. Benchmark rates are another problem that requires further thought and it affects both the money and bond markets. Will the benchmark rates such as the average weighted money market rate (TMP)  the average bond yield (TMO) and the PIBOR still be in use after the changeover? Should we consider making some of them “European” rates? The dynamics of a single financial market obviously create an incentive to harmonize the market benchmark rates used in the various financial centres for the money market  and for the bond market as well. It is in everybody’s interest for the different financial centres to work together and with the monetary authorities on these issues  which the EMI will also study as part of its work on the harmonization of market standards. Interest-Rate Derivatives Markets On the interest-rate derivatives markets  the changeover to the single currency will lead to the constitution of a euro yield curve. Traders will be able to start trading on this curve immediately. Financial centres  such a Paris  must be prepared to: - offer a complete range of products covering all the strategic points on the new yield curve as soon as possible; - ensure that the liquidity of contracts denominated in national currency is transferred to euro contracts. Some 80% of the trading volume on the MATIF futures market in Paris involves interest-rate products  and all of them are to be converted into euro on 1 January 1999. BIS Review 7/1997 - 5 - With this in mind  MATIF SA  and the market players  have just presented a strategic plan aimed at providing participants with instruments covering the whole euro yield curve in 1999  and ensuring greater liquidity for the existing French-franc products  for example  by introducing a five-year contract. MATIF SA has also decided that PIBOR contracts maturing after 1999  will be traded in an environment of euro-denominated benchmark rates  and not French franc rates. 1.2.3. Equity Markets The banking and financial community opted for a simultaneous changeover for the monthly settlement  spot  and OTC equity markets on 1 January 1999. Starting on 1 January 1999  shares  profit-sharing certificates and convertible bonds will be quoted in euro. Credit institutions’ entire securities operations will change over to the euro all at once. The market intermediaries will install converters to provide the interface for customers holding French-franc denominated accounts during the transitional period up until 1 January 2002. The changeover in equity transactions will be a complex project that must reconcile the use of the euro for quotations and delivery-versus-payment settlements with the use of the French franc by issuers for their accounting. French-franc issuers will have to convert the par values of their shares at a later date. Thus  if we wish to limit the number of conversion operations that the intermediaries will have to carry out  we should examine which legal conditions would enable listed companies to express the financial flows relating to their securities issues and dividend payments in euro during the transitional period. Transactions with customers will continue to be dealt with in the national currency during the transitional period  particularly in the case of shares. On the other hand  the changeover to the euro in over-the-counter market transactions between professionals is unlikely to raise any special problems. Markets always adapt rapidly by nature. The work under way proves that market professionals are determined to be ready on time  but the legal framework defined for the use of the euro also has an important role to play. The options chosen in the draft European regulations on the status of the euro provide market participants with a clear-cut legal framework that will make the changeover easier. 2. European Financial Markets and Monetary Union: The New Environment The changeover of the financial markets to the euro on 1 January 1999 requires appropriate technical preparations to set the ground rules. But  within this carefully defined framework  the strategic responses of the participants and institutions involved will be vitally important. The Paris financial market should be able to build on its considerable advantages to flourish as the environment grows more competitive. 2.1. Expected Changes in the Competition between European Financial Centres 2.1.1. Short-term interest rates will be the same throughout the euro area. Entry into Monetary Union will be based on macro-economic convergence  irrevocable fixing of exchange rates  a single monetary policy and fiscal policies that are consistent with the Stability Pact. This means that the main macro-economic factors influencing the value of financial assets should become more uniform. BIS Review 7/1997 - 6 - Substitution between financial assets within the same categories should become easier  even though the issuers are still of different nationalities. This phenomenon is bound to have the greatest impact on interbank deposits  because the single monetary policy within the euro area will mean that banks with comparable credit ratings should logically pay the same rate of interest  no matter which country they are from. It follows that the prices of other categories of short-term securities  which are usually set with reference to interbank interest rates  should also start to show uniform yield curves. For example  the prices of French Treasury bills (BTFs) are set with reference to interbank rate expectations via the arbitraging mechanisms linking the interbank rates to their derivatives in the form of interest-rate futures and swaps. 2.1.2. At the long end of the yield curve there may be some residual differences between government bond markets in the euro area. 2.1.2.1. Entry into Monetary Union is a powerful factor for producing uniform yields on the participating countries’ government bonds. Traditionally  two essential factors are put forward to explain differences in government bond yields. These are the premiums to cover credit and exchange risks. As Monetary Union is based on macro-economic convergence and irrevocably fixed exchange rates for the countries taking part  these premiums should be greatly reduced  or even disappear. Theoretical Impact on the Credit Risk Premium Traders will distinguish between the creditworthiness of two sovereign issuers if they feel that the risk of default is not the same in both cases. The credit risk depends directly on the issuer’s debt servicing capacity. The assessment of a government as a credit risk is naturally based on an estimate of how sound its financial position is. The criteria that the major rating agencies and others usually apply relate to the main aspects of a country’s economy  such as growth  inflation  the balance of payments  fiscal balance and outstanding government debt. On the basis of these criteria  the countries in Monetary Union should  in theory  be given comparable credit ratings. Entry into Union requires strict adherence to the convergence criteria and compliance with the Stability Pact. These are serious guarantees of durable macro-economic convergence in the participating countries. The leading international agencies have already given comparable ratings to the countries with the most similar economies  which are also the ones most widely believed by the markets to be the first to enter Monetary Union on 1 January 1999. Theoretical Impact on the Exchange Risk Premium Operators will demand a higher yield before investing in a foreign market if they perceive an exchange risk. This extra yield  or premium  offsets the losses that could be incurred due to a change in the exchange rate. The exchange risk between the various countries entering Stage Three of Monetary Union will disappear on 1 January 1999. The yield differentials between these countries’ government securities reflecting the risk of variations in the exchange rates between their currencies should naturally cancel each other out. The euro is to be as strong and credible as the leading currencies in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism today. It will be a magnet for savings from non-euro area countries. A very large and BIS Review 7/1997 - 7 - liquid market of European government securities with fairly uniform features can be expected to emerge as an alternative to dollar-denominated investments. This is another factor contributing to uniform yields on bonds issued by the governments of countries in the euro area. 2.1.2.2. Some economic and technical factors could be an obstacle to uniform yields and residual differentials may persist. The logical conclusion of the theoretical considerations outlined above would be that there is no fundamental reason for the yields on government bonds in the euro area to diverge once Monetary Union has been achieved. However  not all analysts agree with this prognosis and major financial players are conducting intensive research to estimate the yield differentials on euro-denominated government securities and to identify the determinants. Three main types of factors could explain the persistence of residual yield differentials. Investor Behaviour in the New Euro Area The irrevocable fixing of the parities between the currencies participating in Monetary Union and the economic convergence requirements for entry will eliminate many sources of the market segmentation and have a twofold impact on the flow of investment into interest-rate markets. - There will be a reallocation of the savings invested in interest-rate products within the euro area; and - a greater share of the total savings is likely to be invested in interest-rate markets outside the euro area. These potential portfolio reallocations could be related to the fact that the range of assets on offer in the euro area countries will be less attractive once Monetary Union has been completed  because the variations in the exchange rates between their currencies  which can cause the value of the securities they issue to increase  will have been eliminated. The changes in the prices of interest-rate products in euro area countries will be increasingly similar  making these products less attractive for international portfolio managers  who use modern portfolio management strategies based on diversification to optimize the risks-rewards relationship. The disappearance of exchange risk will also lead to reallocation by inciting portfolio managers who had previously limited their activity to the domestic market to expand into the markets in other euro area countries. A major source of risk in investing in foreign markets within the euro area will have been eliminated and the factors affecting interest-rate product prices in two different Monetary Union currencies will become more and more similar. This restructuring of interest-rate product portfolios could actually help maintain yield differentials on various euro area government securities. Since the bond markets in the euro area would appear to be good substitutes for each other once Monetary Union looks like a viable proposition  there would be a risk that the reallocation of cross-border investment flows could favour the markets with the most attractive technical features. The substantial technical differences between markets in the euro zone could  all things being equal  introduce yield differentials on government securities. However  some major institutional investors in the euro area currently have management constraints  such as the matching principle for insurance companies  that limit their ability to buy securities denominated in other currencies. We cannot rule out the possibility that such investors may overlook the technical differences between national market segments in the euro area and BIS Review 7/1997 - 8 - increase their investment in securities carrying a premium. This would further contribute to a convergence of yields within the euro area. The Way Fiscal Policy is Implemented Article 104b of the Maastricht Treaty prohibits joint financial liability between the Member States. This means that when investors define and implement their portfolio strategies  they will still be just as sensitive to differences in fiscal policies as before  even though these policies will never be able to stray far or for long from the discipline laid down in the Stability Pact. Under these conditions  the slightest sign perceived by the markets as a loosening of fiscal policy will be penalized by a widening of the yield differential between the offending country and the other countries in the euro area. Technical Elements Technical differences between national bond markets that have not been ironed out by the start of Stage Three could also contribute to the persistence of yield differentials on government securities. The prime causes would be differences in the liquidity of government bonds stemming from the various governments’ issuance policies  unequal development in repo markets and whether stripped bonds are available for investors wishing to take more sensitive positions. Other causes could be differences in taxation and regulatory requirements affecting intermediaries and investors. 2.1.2.3. Sizeable yield differentials between different bond markets could have a big impact on market benchmarks and financial asset pricing techniques. Financial asset pricing techniques all rely on the riskless yield curve and this raises the question of which rates will constitute this curve in the euro area. It could be made up of the lowest rates at each point along the curve  in which case it would not be very uniform. Or else  it could be made up of the average yields on government bonds. The lack of an undisputed benchmark curve could lead to varying practices within the market. This problem could result in the interest-rate swap curve being taken as the benchmark curve  since the swap market is very wide and the technical conditions are the same everywhere. Indeed  we can see that the convergence process has already had a more pronounced impact on the interest-rate swap market. As this will continue after the start of Stage Three  the yield curve based on swaps can be expected to be more uniform than the government bond yield curve  thus prompting operators to use it as the benchmark for their pricing techniques. Up until now these techniques have been based on the riskless yield curve. They will have to adopt a new and radically different benchmark. 2.1.2.4. Certain measures can be considered to minimize yield differentials as far as possible. - Issuing strategies could be harmonized. Differences in issuing patterns relating to the range of securities on offer  the degree of fungibility and standardization of coupon payment dates  as well as issuing timetables can create liquidity premiums that vary from one country to the next on the same segment of the yield curve. For example  the differences in the yields on 2-year issues in France and Germany are amplified by the lesser liquidity of the German securities. Sweden has BIS Review 7/1997 - 9 - already started to standardize coupon payment dates by aligning that of its latest 10-year issue on the most liquid line of the 10-year French OAT bonds (25/10/2006). - Issuing techniques and market-making techniques on the secondary market could be harmonized. Here again  differences in the techniques used can create yield differentials between comparable securities. This type of phenomenon is undoubtedly at work for French and German bonds. The Bundesbank’s auction technique  which combines syndication  competitive bidding and tap issues  as well as its presence in the secondary market are in contrast to the mainly competitive procedures used for French Treasury issues with bid-price auctions and the marginal role played by the Treasury on the secondary market. - Taxation could be harmonized. Here  the priority should be on harmonizing taxes on income and capital gains from bonds. The example of municipal bonds in the United States  where tax exemptions lead to lower yields on these bonds than on federal government bonds  shows that tax considerations have a substantial impact on yields. It would also be a good idea to harmonize tax collection techniques  with the preference being given to withholding taxes on bonds. The Strengths of the Paris Market in the New Environment Created by Monetary 2.2. Union The Paris financial centre and its participants have substantial advantages to meet the new competitive challenges in financial markets. These advantages will enable them to seize the opportunities offered by Monetary Union for the development of their activities. 2.2.1. A Wide Range of Competitive Financial Services and Products Paris offers an array of financial services and products that enjoy a strong position in the international competition. - The regulated markets  SBF  Bourse de Paris and MATIF  rank among the world leaders. MATIF is Europe’s second largest derivatives market. The French equity market has surged ahead in recent years and attracts large numbers of foreign investors  who currently hold about a third of the total market capitalization. - Paris OTC markets  particularly for derivatives  are technically advanced and highly active. According to a Banque de France survey published in April 1995 as part of a coordinated project involving six financial centres under the aegis of the Bank for International Settlements  France’s derivatives markets rank fourth world-wide  accounting for 6.4% of world activity. The transactions are highly international  with 76% of the transactions in currency derivatives and 47% of the transactions in interest-rate derivatives involving non-resident counterparties. - France’s attractive money market is open to industrial and commercial companies  allowing them to issue negotiable debt securities. It is based on highly efficient repurchase agreements. The repo market has grown substantially in recent years. The volume of the main operators’ lending granted under repurchase agreements with delivery of the securities increased twelve fold between the fourth quarter of 1991 and the fourth quarter of 1994  and then it doubled again by the end of 1995. This form of repo accounted for only 3% of the main operators’ lending on the interbank market in 1991  but this figure increased to 37% in 1995. The Banque de France worked hard to achieve this increase. It helped eliminate legal risk with a market agreement introduced in September 1988  followed by a second version  backed up by a standard repo contract in July 1990. At the same date  the Banque de France also introduced Treasury bill repos for its bid tenders. This momentum was BIS Review 7/1997 - 10 - reinforced in 1994 and 1995 by an Act of Parliament defining the repurchase agreement with delivery of the securities. The Act cleared up the remaining uncertainties over the legal and tax status of repos. The Treasury also set up a circle of market-makers  creating a class of primary dealers in Treasury repos (SPVTs-Spécialistes en pensions sur valeurs du Trésor). - Paris has a large bond market driven by both public- and private-sector issuers. The overall value of outstanding issues on the French bond market stood at USD 1 011 billion at the end of 1995  which is 16% of the world total. This makes the French market the fourth largest in the world  behind the American  Japanese and German markets. - Paris offers fast and reliable delivery-versus-payment settlement systems. In 1997  the Transferts Banque de France  or TBF  real-time gross settlement system will be introduced as part of the risk-prevention programme. It will provide immediate finality of payment for large-value funds transfers throughout the day. At the same time  the delivery-versus-payment securities settlement system will be unified and provide same-day settlement as part of the Relit Grande Vitesse Project (RVG). 2.2.2. An Attractive Government Debt Market that will Set the Pace in the Euro Area The French government securities market is one of the key advantages that Paris enjoys in the run-up to the euro. It is based on a system of market-makers  where the primary dealers are known as SVTs  and offers a very large pool of securities covering the whole spectrum of the yield curve. It is one of the world’s most advanced and efficient bond markets. It benefits from the Treasury’s issuance policy  which currently offers three key advantages: simple products; highly liquid lines (many of which are fungible); and maximum regularity of issuance. The other advantages of the market include the group of specialized operators  who are the primary dealers in Treasury securities and the transparency of its organized procedures that are open to all investors. The market’s leadership is based on the high credit rating of the French State and the highly developed MATIF futures and options market  which is one of the top-ranking markets of the world. In a euro-denominated government debt market  where the yield differentials on bonds from the different sovereign issuers should be small  the advantages of the French debt market should attract investors to French government securities and should generate a great deal of business for all the related products  including derivatives and bonds from other French public-sector issuers. I will conclude by saying that the changeover to the euro will bring sweeping changes to the competitive environment in financial markets. But it will not necessarily lead to disruption  if the markets have prepared properly for the transition. The ESCB  with its multiple-based operations  will ensure equal treatment of the various financial centres. A key differentiation factor will be the skills and the expertise of the trading-room teams. This means Paris has everything it will take to flourish in the new competitive environment resulting from Monetary Union. BIS Review 7/1997
r970203a,1997-02-03,https://www.bis.org/review/r970203a.pdf,Mr. Bäckström explains why price stability ought to be a central bank's principle monetary policy objective (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  28 Jan 97),Address by the Governor of the Bank of Sweden  Mr. Urban Bäckström  at Handelsbanken seminar in London on 28/1/97.,Mr. Bäckström explains why price stability ought to be a central bank’s principle monetary policy objective Address by the Governor of the Bank of Sweden  Mr. Urban Bäckström  at Handelsbanken seminar in London on 28/1/97. For most central banks today the primary monetary policy objective is price stability. The situation is thus very different from that which prevailed in the earlier period of high inflation. The reorientation of monetary policy stems from people’s growing awareness of an inflationary economy’s harmful effects. The central banks  which are ultimately accountable to their countries’ citizens and the latter’s representatives  would otherwise not have been mandated to focus policy on price stability. In Sweden  for example  60 per cent of the population see 2 per cent inflation as an appropriate monetary policy objective and only 12 per cent are against this. In my country a low inflation policy therefore has broad political support. I shall be talking today about why price stability ought to be a central bank’s principal monetary policy objective and what this means for economic growth  employment and unemployment. From there I shall consider development in Sweden  the framework of our monetary policy and the current situation. Why price stability? Why should price stability be singled out as a central bank’s overriding objective? Why not attach equal importance to targets for growth  employment and unemployment  particularly as these factors have high priority for economic policy in general? The answer to these questions calls for an understanding of what monetary policy can and cannot do. In the long run monetary policy is only capable of influencing inflation; a systematically higher rate of inflation  however  would not lead to higher long-term growth. The level of long-term growth is determined instead by real economic factors such as demographic changes  technology  education and the efficiency of markets. In so far as a long-term relationship between inflation and growth does exist  most of the evidence suggests that  if anything  higher inflation impairs the workings of the economy and thereby weakens output. Today there is widespread - though not yet complete - agreement on this. What monetary policy can do  on the other hand  is influence the economy’s fluctuations around the long-term trend  albeit without any lasting effects on growth. This means that if resource utilisation is low or high  monetary policy can be used to stimulate or dampen activity temporarily  but not to fine-tune the economy. With an inflation target which applies downwards as well as upwards  so that deflation as well as inflation are avoided  monetary policy can then exercise a stabilising influence and help to smooth economic fluctuations around the long-term trend. Problems arise if resource utilisation becomes so high that inflation starts to accelerate and the central bank has not intervened. People may then begin to count on inflation remaining high in the longer run. A higher level of inflation may then be established  whereas the effects on production and employment will be only temporary. This is a reason why the central bank should act with foresight and be alert to the development of inflation expectations. BIS Review 8/1997 - 2 - The potential for influencing fluctuations in activity around the trend is dependent on people’s appraisal of the central bank’s determination and ability to maintain price stability. Central bankers talk of the importance of credibility  by which is meant the extent to which people expect inflation to be in line with its targeted rate. The degree of credibility is conditioned by  for example  the historical record of inflation and the existence of government financial deficits. Weak credibility calls for caution in monetary policy  just as higher credibility confers more room in which to manoeuvre. Experience has shown  moreover  that even in the shorter run  the possibility of influencing employment and unemployment via monetary policy is very limited. Limited fluctuations around the growth trend are by no means sufficient condition for a smooth development of employment and low unemployment. Comparisons between countries and regions reveal that a similar growth pattern  even over a considerable period  can involve markedly divergent effects on employment and unemployment. This highlights the function of the labour market. It is there that measures must be taken in order to tackle problems with employment and unemployment. I want to underscore some conclusions from this discussion. Monetary policy cannot have growth as the primary objective because it is not capable of influencing growth in the longer run. At the same time  monetary policy can be used to smooth fluctuations in activity around the growth trend. But I should emphasise that this presupposes that the central bank is committed to price stability and that its policy is perceived as credible. With low inflation  moreover  the economy will function more efficiently. It is important  I believe  to realise that price stability’s status as the monetary policy objective does not imply a lower priority for growth and employment as economic policy’s overall objectives. Rather than being an impediment  low inflation creates good conditions for growth. In order for this to be combined with low unemployment  the labour market must also function properly. Monetary policy with an explicit inflation target Since the move to a flexible exchange rate in the autumn of 1992  monetary policy in Sweden has been conducted with an explicit inflation target. The Swedish target for the rate of inflation  which is appraised in an annual perspective and expressed in terms of the consumer price index  is 2 per cent. The target is surrounded by a band of – 1 percentage point  which serves among other things as a buffer for temporary effects on inflation. I should like to mention some factors which illustrate how the Riksbank works on the construction of monetary policy with an inflation target. As monetary policy is characterised by long and variable lags  the policy needs to be forward-looking and based on an inflation forecast. In order to clarify our deliberations in the assessment of future inflation  the Riksbank presents an inflation report four times a year. A number of indicators are reviewed in these reports  together with an assessment of future tendencies and a discussion of risks and opportunities in the field of inflation. Simplifying somewhat  an inflation forecast can be said to rest on two factors in particular: one is the relationship between supply and demand and the other is expected inflation. The difference between the actual level of demand and the potential level of production that can be combined with an unchanged rate of inflation is commonly referred to as the output gap. As BIS Review 8/1997 - 3 - this gap is a notional variable  it is difficult to calculate exactly. We therefore use a variety of indicators to check for consistency of the assessments. The inflation target is symmetrical; that is  preventing inflation from falling below the target is as important for the Riksbank as stopping it from rising above the target. Over time  the economy will then expand at its potential rate. The inflation targeting approach accordingly has a built-in control mechanism. If the monetary stance is unduly tight  bringing economic activity below the potential level  inflation will decrease and sooner or later fall short of the target; and vice versa. This calls for a calibration of the output gap  a new inflation forecast and an adjustment of monetary policy. Factors that generate changes in ongoing rate of inflation must be distinguished from temporary effects on inflation due to once-and-for-all shifts in the price level. It is mainly variations in the output gap and in expected inflation which have an impact on the ongoing rate of inflation. Monetary policy accordingly focuses on these factors. Temporary effects on inflation may come  for example  from changes in indirect taxes and subsidies or from shifts in terms of trade. Monetary policy measures as such may likewise have temporary effects on inflation via changes in house mortgage costs  which are included in the measurement of consumer prices. This was the case in 1996  when the average rate of inflation fell below the lower band limit of 1 per cent mainly as a temporary consequence of the Riksbank’s reduction of its instrumental rate. Clearly  monetary policy should not respond to temporary effects on inflation from upward or downward movements in the instrumental rate; to do so would be to make interest rate policy procyclical and thereby destabilising. The monetary policy reaction to other temporary effects depends essentially on how these affect inflation expectations. If a temporary increase in the rate of inflation is taken  for example  to indicate a more lasting upward shift  so that people adjust their inflation expectations  monetary policy would have to respond in order to prevent the ongoing rate of inflation from increasing. If expectations are unaffected  on the other hand  temporary effects may be of secondary importance for monetary policy. Where  then  does the exchange rate come in? Apart from its short-run effects via import prices  the exchange rate features in our inflation assessments in two respects. One is that exchange rate movements affect demand in the internationally oriented sector and thereby in time the development of the output gap and ultimately inflation  too. The other is the information which the exchange rate may provide about the development of inflation expectations. While temporary exchange rate fluctuations hardly affect forecasts of inflation one to two years ahead  more lasting tendencies have an overall impact on demand and thereby on the output gap and consequently on the inflation forecast. Adjustment after the inflation era Sweden is one example of the numerous countries that in the 1970s and 1980s systematically aimed for higher growth and employment with the aid of expansionary economic policies  with less regard for the effects on long-term price stability. The outcome was very different from what had been intended. Compared with countries more devoted to stability  for example the Netherlands  Austria and Germany  macroeconomic development in Sweden was poorer in many respects. BIS Review 8/1997 - 4 - Inflation in Sweden moved up substantially from the late 1960s onwards  trend growth weakened and the period ended in the early 1990s with a dramatic fall in production  a sharp increase in unemployment and a serious crisis in the financial system. The tendencies in the latter part of the 1980s were not sustainable. The levels of growth  employment and prices for real and financial assets could not be maintained. Partly for these reasons  Sweden experienced a profound crisis. Had the adjustment been made earlier and resulted in stability  perhaps the crisis would have been less painful. In recent years  however  the process of adjustment in Sweden has come a long way. The economy is in the process of adjusting to the conditions that apply in a low inflation regime. This is being accompanied by an appreciable improvement in government finance  not least as a result of the extensive consolidation programme. From a two-digit level just a few years ago  for 1996 it seems that the government deficit has been reduced to between 3 and 3.5 per cent of GDP. Moreover  the improvement is expected to continue. That the consolidation of government finance proceeds successfully to the goal of balance in 1998 is of the utmost importance in that this lays a foundation for balanced  sustainable growth. With the new  globalised capital market  the need for discipline in economic policy soon makes itself felt  particularly for a country that has had a difficult period of deficits and has therefore become more dependent on domestic and foreign creditors. After all the experiences earlier in the 1990s  this is widely understood in Sweden. The resolution with which the consolidation is being achieved has been questioned from time to time. However  the six-monthly control stations that are an integral part of the Swedish consolidation programme have made - and continue to make - it possible for observers to monitor the political system’s determination in this respect to achieve the goal of balance in 1998. The current situation At the beginning of 1996  favourable prospects for inflation prompted a monetary policy realignment. Continuously falling inflation expectations  accompanied by subdued demand  improved the outlook for inflation in 1996 and 1997. At the end of 1996 underlying rate of inflation was about 1.5 per cent. The twelve-month rate of headline inflation  which was actually negative for some months in the latter part of 1996  was affected by temporary factors  above all as a result of the Riksbank’s interest rate cuts. The better prospects for inflation paved the way for a notable reduction of the repo rate during 1996  from 8.91 to 4.10 per cent  the latter being the lowest instrumental rate in Sweden for at least thirty years. Together with the impact of the exchange rate  the overall monetary conditions are accordingly contributing to a continued recovery in the real economy. A shift in the composition of demand began in the course of 1996. But although the contribution to GDP growth from net exports decreased  the effect of foreign trade remains positive. Private consumption is continuing to rise at a subdued but stable rate and its composition seems to be shifting in favour of durable goods  cars in particular. There are no signs that in the coming two years the economy will exceed the level of potential output at which inflation is liable to pick up. The level of inflation expectations is also compatible with the inflation target. BIS Review 8/1997 - 5 - The exchange rate has been weaker than assumed in the latest inflation report and the current level of the effective exchange rate does not mirror fundamental trends in the economy. This points to some future appreciation. Meanwhile  GDP growth in 1996 seems to have been somewhat lower than the Riksbank counted on  which implies a somewhat larger output gap. All in all  the picture of future inflation does not appear to have changed from the assessment in the December inflation report. The conclusion in that report - that monetary policy is relatively well balanced - therefore holds good. The Riksbank is continuing to evaluate effects of the interest rate cuts that were implemented during 1996  together with new information about real economic activity  inflation expectations and the exchange rate. This in turn will determine the future course of monetary policy  that is  whether the repo rate should be kept at its present level or whether there is any limited room for manoeuvre.

Rangarajan  at the Second Conference of the Econometric Society's Regional Chapter for India and South Asia in Delhi on 28/12/96.,Mr. Rangarajan examines the objectives of monetary policy and price stability in relation to the economy of India Address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India  Mr. C. Rangarajan  at the Second Conference of the Econometric Society’s Regional Chapter for India and South Asia in Delhi on 28/12/96. 1. It gives me indeed very great pleasure to be in your midst this morning. It is indeed very gratifying to note that the Second Conference of the Econometric Society’s Regional Chapter for India and South East Asia is being held in Delhi. 2. Econometrics as a discipline has come a long way. Enriched by the developments both in mathematical economics and statistical methods  econometrics has today become an indispensable tool to all practitioners. Without a numerical evaluation of economic magnitudes  economic theory would have been of little use in economic policy. The original motto of Cowles Foundation was ‘Science is measurement’. It used to be said that in economics the tendency of theory to lag behind observations seemed to be endemic. We have definitely moved away from that situation. While alternative theories to explain a set of phenomena are not necessarily a weakness and may even be regarded as a sign of vitality  the continued co-existence of alternative theories over a substantial period of time without being able to discriminate among them can result in the loss of credibility in the discipline itself. This in part is the present status of economics. The future scope of econometrics is thus immense. 3. I would like to take this opportunity given to me this morning to raise one issue in monetary policy that still remains contentious despite overwhelming agreement among policy makers in industrially advanced countries. The issue relates to the objective of monetary policy. The question is: What should be the objective or objectives of monetary policy and whether in the Indian context  maintenance of price stability should be the dominant objective of monetary policy? 4. The issue of objective has become important because of the need to provide clear guidance to monetary policy makers. Indeed this aspect has assumed added significance in the context of the increasing stress on autonomy of central banks. While autonomy has to go with accountability  accountability itself requires a clear enunciation of goals. 5. Monetary policy has now moved to the centre stage of economic policy-making the world over. In the 1930s and in the first two decades after the Second World War  monetary policy was relegated to the background. The ascendancy of fiscal policy during this period was due in part to the depression of the 1930s  and the process of reconstruction immediately after the Second World War and the acceptance of the Keynesian dictum that fiscal action was necessary to prevent deficiency in the aggregate demand. However  the 1970s saw the emergence of a combination of high inflation and low growth - ‘stagnation’ as it came to be called - and the standard Keynesian analysis was hard put to explain that phenomenon. Consequently  monetary policy re-emerged as an instrument of economic policy particularly in the fight against inflation. Issues relating to the conduct of monetary policy came to the forefront of policy debates in the 1980s. The relative importance of growth and price stability as the objective of monetary policy as well as the appropriate intermediate target of monetary policy became the focus of attention. Over the years  a consensus has emerged among the industrially advanced countries that the dominant objective of monetary policy should be price stability. Incorporation of this objective in the Maastrischt Treaty is indeed a reflection of this consensus. Differences however  exist among central banks even in industrially advanced countries as regards the appropriate intermediate target. While some central banks consider monetary BIS Review 8/1997 - 2 - aggregates and therefore monetary targeting as operationally meaningful  some others focus exclusively on interest rate even though the inter-relationship between the two targets is well recognised. 6. A similar trend regarding monetary policy is discernible in developing economies as well. Much of the early literature on development economics focused on real factors such as savings  investment and technology as main springs of growth. Very little attention was paid to the financial system as a contributory factor to economic growth. In fact  many writers felt that inflation was endemic in the process of economic growth and it was accordingly treated more as a consequence of structural imbalance than as a monetary phenomenon. However  with the accumulated evidence  it became clear that any process of economic growth in which monetary expansion was disregarded also led to inflationary pressures with a consequent impact on economic growth. Accordingly  importance of price stability and therefore the need to use monetary policy for that purpose also assumed importance in developing economies. Nonetheless  the debate on the extent to which price stability should be deemed to be the over-riding objective of monetary policy in such economies continues. 7. Monetary policy is an arm of economic policy and in that sense  the objectives of monetary policy are no different from the overall objectives of economic policy. The broad objectives of monetary policy in India have been a) b) to regulate monetary expansion so as to maintain a reasonable degree of price stability; and to ensure adequate expansion in credit to assist economic growth. The emphasis between the two objectives has changed from year to year depending upon the conditions prevailing in that and the previous year. 8. The question of a dominant objective arises essentially in view of the multiplicity of objectives and the inherent conflict among such objectives. Jan Tinbergen had argued decades ago that it was necessary to have at least one instrument for each target. In this regard  it must be recognised that certain objectives are better suited or more easily achieved with certain instruments than with others. This ‘assignment rule’ favours monetary policy as the most appropriate instrument to achieve the objective of price stability. 9. The crucial question that arises is whether the pursuit of the objective of price stability by monetary authorities undermines the ability of the economy to attain and sustain higher growth. A great deal of research effort has been spent on the examination of the trade-off between economic growth and price stability. 10. The well known Phillips curve showed that there was an inverse relationship between rate of change in wage rate and unemployment rate suggesting thereby a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. The original article of Prof. Phillips was published in 1958. The Phillips curve relationship has subsequently been challenged both from theoretical and empirical standpoints. The downward slope of the curve arises basically because of the presence of money illusion and expected inflation deviating from actual inflation. At present the controversy is centred around the possible short-run and long-run ‘trade-off’ between inflation and unemployment. This distinction primarily stems from 11. BIS Review 8/1997 - 3 - the assumption of ‘error-learning’ process in the determination of inflationary expectations - workers do have an anticipation on the inflation  but because they judge the inflation performance from the past data  the adjustment between the expected and actual inflation is slow. This implies that in the short-run  nominal wage rise will not fully absorb the actual inflation  and as such  it is argued  there is scope for reducing unemployment through inflation. As people adjust their expectations of inflation  the short-run Phillips curve shifts upward and the unemployment rate returns towards its ‘natural’ level. As the expected inflation catches up with actual inflation  the Phillips curve becomes vertical  denying thereby a ‘trade-off’ between inflation and unemployment in the long run. The Phillips curve thus provides at best a temporary trade-off between inflation and unemployment when the economy is adjusting to shocks to aggregate demand and as long as expected inflation is lower than actual inflation. The long-run Phillips curve becomes almost vertical at the natural rate of unemployment. 12. Of course  there is a possibility of lengthening the short-run ‘trade-offs’ indefinitely  since inflation surprises in each period can elongate the long-run perpetually. But  in that case the ‘trade-offs’ will become sharper in each successive period. In other words  to maintain the unemployment below the ‘natural’ rate  policy authorities will have to inflate the economy at higher rates in each successive period. This has a major policy implication even if the economy does not operate on the long-run vertical Phillips curve. Under the ‘rational expectations hypothesis’  as there are no deviations between ‘actual’  and ‘expected’ inflation  both in the short-run and long-run  Phillips curves are treated as being vertical with no trade-off between inflation and unemployment. 13. Another policy related question is the shape of the short-run Phillips curve itself. In the real world wages and prices remain sticky  as employment contracts are fairly long and there is also a cost in changing the individual prices too often  or renegotiating wages each time after a price rise. As argued by Fischer (1994)  the nature of stickiness in wages and prices could be different in different economies and this could also be a function of the inflation history of the country concerned. Countries with high inflation rates tend to find themselves on the steeper portion of the short-run Phillips curve than low inflation countries which are more likely to be on the flatter side. Therefore  ‘trade-off’ between price stability and employment or output even when it does exist  is sharper for countries with relatively high inflation rates than those with low inflation rates. 14. The case of price stability as the objective of monetary policy rests on the fact that volatility in prices creates uncertainty in decision making. Rising prices affect savings adversely while making speculative investments more attractive. The most important contribution of the financial system to an economy is its ability to augment savings and allocate resources more efficiently. A regime of rising prices vitiates the atmosphere for promotion of savings and allocation of investment. Apart from all of these  there is also a social dimension. Inflation affects adversely those who have no hedges against inflation and that includes all the poorer sections of the community. Of course  a critical question in this context is at what level of inflation the adverse consequences begin to set in. 15. Inflation affects fiscal balance in several ways. It adversely affects fiscal deficit when elasticity of expenditure to inflation is higher than that of revenue. A more significant impact of inflation arises from its effect on interest rate and the dynamic sustainability of the fiscal situation. High rates of inflation signal weak resolve to control inflation and imply higher expected inflation in future. This gives rise to upward rigidity in nominal interest and leads to high debt service burden on the budget  thus reducing the manoeuvrability of fiscal management. BIS Review 8/1997 - 4 - 16. It is well recognised that adverse implications of inflation are higher at high rates of inflation  while a moderate inflation rate could be manageable without implying severe costs. International evidence suggests that the costs of uncertainty tend to rise in a non-linear fashion with inflation rate exceeding a threshold. One important caveat in interpreting the threshold of inflation rate beyond which costs exceed benefit is the provision of inflation protection measures available in the economy  which tends to moderate the adverse implications to some extent. Countries with a moderate inflation rate but inadequate indexation provision may show a higher degree of sensitivity to inflation  than those with low inflation. Most of the industrialised countries in the recent years have moved into an inflation rate ranging between two to three per cent. Among the developing countries  some of the fast growing East-Asian economies have in recent years not only demonstrated low inflation rates ranging between three to five per cent  but the growth rate at these inflation rates has been fairly high at around eight per cent. 17. Empirical evidence on the relationship between the inflation and growth in cross-country frameworks is somewhat inconclusive because such studies include countries with inflation rate of as low as one to two per cent as well as countries with inflation rates going beyond 200 and 300 per cent. While a number of studies have concluded that the negative impact of inflation on growth is high at high rates of inflation  there is no consensus about the threshold inflation rate beyond which the negative impact becomes pronounced. A study by Bruno indicated that growth rates declined steeply as the inflation rate went beyond 25 per cent. Another study also based on cross section of countries reported that the negative effect of inflation was very pronounced and powerful at inflation rates exceeding eight per cent. What the appropriate inflation threshold beyond which costs tend to exceed benefits need to be estimated for each country separately. Nevertheless  people worry about even moderate inflation levels because if not held in check  a little inflation can lead to higher inflation and eventually affect growth. 18. A macro-econometric model of the Indian economy shows that a 10 per cent sustained increase in real public investment in non-agriculture sector  financed by money creation leads to an annual inflation rate of about 2.3 per cent and additional GDP growth of one percent  on an average  during the first two years  while in the span of 10 to 15 years  inflation rate rises to about 17 per cent per annum and additional output growth slows down considerably to average 2.7 per cent during this period. This implies that in the long run a sustained improvement in the growth scenario through monetary financing of the deficit could involve a severe trade-off in terms of inflation - every one per cent additional output growth implies nearly 6 to 6.5 per cent rise in inflation rate in the long run. 19. Obviously  there are some critics of price stability as the dominant objective of monetary policy. For example Prof. Paul Krugman writes ‘.....the belief that absolute price stability is a huge blessing  that it brings large benefits with few if any costs  rests not on evidence but on faith. The evidence actually points the other way: the benefits of price stability are elusive  the costs of getting there are large  and zero inflation may not be a good thing even in the long run.’ The observations of Prof. Krugman as they stand are not directed against price stability as an objective but are aimed against a policy which seeks ‘absolute’ price stability and attempts to bring down the inflation rate from around two per cent to almost zero. This is evident from what he himself advocates: BIS Review 8/1997 - 5 - ‘.....adopt as a long run target fairly low but not zero inflation  say three- four per cent. This is high enough to accommodate most of the real wage cuts that markets impose  while the costs of the inflation itself will still be very small. Interestingly  in India  the Chakravarty Committee (1985) treated an inflation rate of four per cent as ‘the acceptable rise in prices’ purported to reflect ‘changes in relative prices necessary to attract resources to growth sectors’. 20. We  in India  need to have an appropriate fix on the acceptable level of inflation rate. In the 1970s  the average annual inflation rate as measured by the wholesale price index was nine per cent. In the 1980s  it was eight per cent. However  in the period between 1990 and 1995  the average inflation rate has remained around 10 per cent. The objective of the policy should be to keep the inflation rate around six per cent. This itself is much higher than what the industrial countries are aiming at and therefore will have some implications for the exchange rate of the rupee. Monetary growth should be so moderated that while meeting the objective of growth it does not push the inflation rate beyond six per cent. 21. A question that arises in this context is whether monetary policy by itself is able to contain inflationary pressures particularly in developing economies like ours. It is true that developing economies like India are subject to greater supply shocks than developed economies. Fluctuations in agricultural output have an important bearing on the price situation. Nevertheless  continuous increase in prices which is what inflation is about cannot occur unless it is sustained by a continuing increase in money supply. Control of the money supply has thus to play an important role in any scheme aimed at controlling inflation. 21. The controversy over the objective of monetary policy has reached such a pitch that some have described central bankism as a religion with hard money as supreme god and inflation as devil. Let me however say that the commitment to a reasonable degree of price stability is not a dogma. It is good economics. BIS Review 8/1997
r970204,1997-02-04,https://www.bis.org/review/r970204.pdf,Mr. Heikensten discusses inflation and the interest rate in Sweden (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  29 Jan 97),Address by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden  Mr. Lars Heikensten  at a conference arranged by the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce and Veckans Affärer on 29/1/97.,Mr. Heikensten discusses inflation and the interest rate in Sweden Address by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden  Mr. Lars Heikensten  at a conference arranged by the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce and Veckans Affärer on 29/1/97. I should like to begin with a word of thanks for the invitation to talk about economic developments  inflation and the conditions for monetary policy. It is beginning to have the feel of a tradition. Today I shall start by considering the course of events since we met here a year ago. Then I intend to take a look at the future and paint a picture of the outlook not just for 1997 but for the somewhat longer perspective that is relevant for monetary policy. Finally I shall draw some policy conclusions. Growth but not employment Before considering 1996  however  I shall look further back. Since the summer of 1993  when the dramatic fall in production was broken  the annual growth rate in the Swedish economy has averaged about 2.8 per cent. This is considerably higher than the rates we were accustomed to in the 1970s and 1980s. In that capacity utilisation was so low initially  it is hardly surprising that growth as such has been high. What is surprising - and very troublesome - is the weak development of employment. Sweden is not alone in Europe in having problems with the creation of new jobs; rather the reverse. But in the United States the situation is very different and even in Europe there are exceptions; one is Holland in the past decade (Diagram 1). The differences from Sweden are appreciable. Today in Sweden the issue of unemployment is being discussed more and more. It is important that the premises for this discussion are correct. At the Riksbank we believe that in the coming two years production in Sweden will pick up again  although growth is unlikely to reach the average level of the past three to four years. This should generate some increase in employment. But a radical improvement in employment calls for more than economic growth; above all it requires that the labour market and wage formation function better. Markedly lower interest rates When I spoke at this conference a year ago the repo rate was 8.66 per cent. In the course of 1996 we lowered the rate 25 times. At the end of 1996 the repo rate was 4.10 per cent as against 8.91 per cent at the beginning. In the industrialised world  the Riksbank’s reduction of its instrumental rate is accordingly one of the largest and steepest. Moreover  the current level of the repo rate is the lowest in Sweden for more than thirty years. The cuts have been gradual and as far as possible predictable. As the outlook for inflation improved and interest rates declined  market perceptions of how far down the repo rate might move were also revised (Diagram 2). Our intention was to bring the repo rate down without any loss of confidence in monetary policy  as expressed in such price variables as the exchange rate and long bond rates. It worked; at no time did the market react so wildly as to disturb the picture. BIS Review 9/1997 - 2 - There are good reasons for underscoring that such a monetary policy realignment presupposes that many factors are favourable. That was the case in 1996. The conditions in international financial markets were stable and positive for Sweden. Economic activity abroad and in Sweden was comparatively weak and implied a good outlook for inflation. Sweden’s fiscal policy was perceived as increasingly credible as the budget outcome improved and both the Government and the Riksdag (Sweden’s parliament) demonstrated a determination to fulfil earlier commitments. Better outlook for inflation In Sweden the outlook for inflation improved on several counts: Economic activity became somewhat weaker. Export growth slackened as a result of the krona’s appreciation and slowdowns abroad. This was accompanied by a reduction of industrial stocks. The domestic economy was relatively weak  though activity does seem to have picked up  particularly last autumn. GDP growth probably amounted to between 1 and 1.5 per cent (Diagram 3). In terms of long-term balance  the composition of growth was favourable  with strong increases for net exports and industrial investment (Diagram 4). There was also a large surplus on current account. The inflation propensity seems to have decreased. The conditions for persistently low inflation improved in a number of respects. The expected rate of inflation fell from survey to survey (Diagram 5). Bond pricing shows a similar picture. Most of the surveyed groups now expect a rate of inflation  even in the longer run  that is well in line with the Riksbank’s target. In parts of the economy it also looks as though pricing behaviour has changed; conceivable explanations for this include increased competition as a result of deregulations and EU membership. These tendencies are difficult to confirm for certain but the indications are clear. Temporary effects have also been at work. The krona’s appreciation accounted for approximately 0.4 percentage points of the fall in inflation from 2.6 per cent in December 1995 to -0.2 per cent in December 1996. For the CPI  the part played by decreased interest rates has been even greater; the downward effect on the inflation from falling house mortgage rates totalled 1.4 percentage points. It is because of the temporary effects that the average level of the inflation in 1996 is outside the Riksbank’s target interval. As a rule  the interval surrounding the target figure should suffice to absorb changes of this type in the composition of inflation. That this was not the case in 1996 had to do with the marked reappraisal of the situation in Sweden. Both the rate of inflation generated domestically and the ways in which the Riksbank measures underlying inflation show a fall that is less dramatic (Diagram 6). Improvement in government finance Perhaps the most pronounced swing in the past year (actually since the summer of 1995) has occurred for government finance. Confidence grew in the ability of the Government and the Riksdag to reverse the crisis. A number of factors contributed to this. The budget outcome successively improved in relation to earlier official estimates (Diagram 7). As regards the budget deficit for 1997  current estimates suggest that BIS Review 9/1997 - 3 - Sweden will do well in a European context. And although Government debt is still high  here  too  the turn seems to be more distinct than expected. Another factor behind the swing is the Government’s clear adherence to the convergence programme from the summer of 1995. When it seemed that the budget target was in danger in the spring of 1996  additional measures were presented to fulfil the ambitions. This had favourable effects on interest rates and credibility. Developments in recent years prompt two distinct warnings. Building up the credibility which characterised the past year took a long time and was very costly. The announcement of extensive measures in the winter of 1994-95 did not suffice. It was not until the budget outcome started to turn that we could reap the positive effects on bond rates  etc. It must also be borne in mind that a part of the budget’s reinforcement is tied to the stronger exchange rate and the lower interest rates. Sustained confidence is therefore a sine qua non for budget consolidation. In view of the political debate  there may be cause to underscore fiscal policy’s importance for monetary policy. A tighter fiscal policy normally implies a better situation for inflation; it makes it easier for the Riksbank to fulfil the inflation target in conjunction with low interest rates. In addition  a fiscal policy that lacks credibility creates problems for monetary policy - as was the case during much of the period 1990-95. The radical lowering of interest rates during 1996 is something for which our thanks are very much due to fiscal policy. Continued economic upswing So much for history. In discussing tendencies for the coming years I shall start from our inflation report last December. In the report  conditions for exports in the coming years were judged to be good. Nothing has occurred to modify that assessment. Industry’s competitive position is favourable. To an increasing extent  export growth seems to be coming from rapidly expanding regions  not least Asia. The international upswing last autumn is expected to become somewhat stronger in both 1997 and 1998. Judging from order inflows and other business tendency figures  the growth of exports is likely to be modest. The most recent figures may perhaps indicate that international developments will generate somewhat weaker growth than expected  but the difference would be marginal. This is countered  moreover  by an exchange rate that  at present at least  is weaker. The conditions for increased demand for consumption were also judged to be favourable (Diagram 8). Neither has the picture in this respect changed at all substantially. Increased consumption is indicated by low interest rates and a level of household saving that  historically  is relatively high and is expected to show some fall. To this can be added an accumulated need to renew the stock of durable goods. The main factor in the opposite direction is unemployment  which is persistently high and even tended to rise in the autumn. Neither are the increments to household income in the period 1997-98 expected to be as large as in 1996. Then there is the uncertainty that stems from weak government finance and the changes that have been made and may be called for in the social security system  including pensions. All in all  however  it seems that the subdued but stable increase in consumption may continue. BIS Review 9/1997 - 4 - In view of the above  we adhere to the growth scenario that featured in the last two inflation reports. This implies an accelerating growth rate that for 1996 and 1997 combined totals almost 4 per cent. Development in 1996  however  seems to have been marginally weaker than we counted on. Some further acceleration of growth is then foreseen in 1998. The conclusion in the inflation report therefore holds good: it is not likely that in the coming two years economic activity will rise above the level of potential output at which inflation is liable to pick up (Diagram 9). Wage development a key factor The wage increases during 1996 exceeded what the Swedish economy can manage in the longer run. The underlying rate of wage increases moved up to more than 5 per cent. The rate of wage increases on top of collective agreements also accelerated in manufacturing. For price formation in 1996  the consequences of these tendencies were limited. As long as domestic demand remains subdued  firms have difficulty in passing through the increased wage costs to prices. The outcome is more likely to be rationalisation  increased productivity and  in certain cases  decreased employment. The starting point for the Riksbank’s assessment of the future rate of wage increases is that a downward adjustment will be achieved. At the time of the settlements that were reached in much of the labour market in 1994-95 the expected level of future inflation was considerably higher than it is today (Diagram 10). The present credibility of the inflation target did not exist. Moreover  employment was rising relatively fast in parts of the economy and profits were higher than they are today. The downward adjustment we foresee is  however  a gradual process and slower than would be desirable. As far as inflation in the next two years is concerned  the slow adjustment is not seen as a problem  at least as long as the situation agrees with the Riksbank’s main scenario  where the growth of consumption is subdued. For employment the problem is greater. Lower wage increases might be accompanied by a faster increase in labour demand. The new information about the rate of wage increases since the December report supports the assessment that some retardation should be feasible during 1997. The wage statistics for the most recent months show signs of some improvement. Future wage formation is being discussed by the labour market organisations. Apart from this  lower wage increases in future agreements are indicated by a number of factors. Profit levels in export companies are lower and there is little possibility of passing through costs to consumers. To date in the 1997 negotiations  wage demands have been lower than in the previous round  though still high in relation to the low inflation expectations. Inflation in line with the target Over the last six months  markets have tended to focus on the latest figures for inflation. In a way  this is hardly surprising - the figures during the autumn have been unexpectedly low. It should be emphasised  however  that the Riksbank’s policy refers to a BIS Review 9/1997 - 5 - longer period. Figures for “yesterday’s” inflation are therefore relevant only in so far as they say something about the future. To some extent that has been the case in the past six months; the figures have suggested a somewhat lower inflation propensity. In the main  however  they have reflected the strength of the transient effects. Inflation expectations  as measured in surveys and forecasts  have been stable  in some cases with a fall during the autumn and winter. The expected rate of inflation one year ahead is around 1.5 per cent and the average rate in the next five years is around 2 per cent. What about the inflation forecasts for the coming years? There are many indications that the 12-month change figure for the CPI reached a low in December  with the prospect of gradually rising figures during the spring as the transient effects that pushed price increases down last year come to an end. At the beginning of 1997  moreover  prices have also been affected by  for example  changes to indirect taxes and subsidies; these changes are expected to raise the price level by about 0.5 per cent. On the other hand  house mortgage interest costs should continue to have a downward effect on prices  at least during 1997. An upward tendency in inflation is therefore something that the Riksbank counts on in the next two years. Consequently it will not come as a surprise  at least as long as it is moderate. In the inflation report we envisaged that during 1997 the CPI would rise by an average of just under 1.5 per cent. For 1998 it was considered that inflation would be somewhat higher  around 2 per cent  which included an increase in the price level of about 0.5 per cent from further changes in taxes and subsidies (Diagram 11). The assessment accordingly pointed to a rate of inflation that would be in line with the Riksbank’s target. Same conclusion The picture I have outlined does not warrant any change in the conclusions presented in the December inflation report. Our main scenario suggests that at present the monetary stance is relatively well balanced. The new information about economic activity and price movements points to a picture of inflation in 1997 that is marginally more positive. In the opposite direction  the exchange rate has been somewhat weaker than we counted on. While this does not stem from what are commonly referred to as economic fundamentals  the fact remains that a weaker exchange rate - which Sweden has now had for a quarter or so - has effects on the picture of demand and inflation. The Riksbank will continue to evaluate the effects of the interest rate cuts that were implemented during 1996. As pointed out on many occasions in the past year  we will also be keeping a close watch on the future development of economic activity. The ongoing construction of monetary policy will depend on our assessment of inflation’s future course  for instance in the light of incoming information.

Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee  I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today. The Committee is faced with a number of complex policy issues that will have an important bearing on the fiscal health of the nation and the welfare of our people well into the next century. I will be happy to respond to questions relating to any of those issues  but in my formal comments this morning I intend to focus on the accuracy of the consumer price index. I would like to begin by commending this Committee for having done so much to bring the issue of possible bias in the CPI to the attention of the Congress and of the nation in general. The hearings conducted by this Committee in 1995  as well as the report produced by the advisory commission that was sponsored by this Committee  have advanced the discussion considerably. These efforts  along with the continuing contributions of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ research staff  have added importantly to our understanding of the sources of measurement error in the CPI. Any index that endeavors to measure the cost of living should aim to be unbiased. That is  a serious examination of all available evidence should yield the conclusion that there is just as great a chance that the index understates the rate of growth of the target concept as there is that it overstates the truth. The present-day consumer price index does not meet this standard. In fact  the best available evidence suggests that there is virtually no chance that the CPI as currently published understates the rate of growth of the appropriate concept. In other words  there is almost a 100 percent probability that we are overcompensating the average social security recipient for increases in the cost of living  and almost a 100 percent probability that we are causing the inflation-adjusted burden of the income tax system to decline more rapidly than I presume the Congress intends. A major reason for this is that consumers respond to changes in relative prices by changing the composition of their actual marketbasket. At present  however  the marketbasket used in constructing the CPI changes only once every decade or so. Moreover  new goods and services deliver value to consumers even at the relatively elevated prices that often prevail early in their life cycles; currently  that value is not reflected in the CPI. For that and other reasons outlined in the Boskin Commission report and other studies  we know with near certainty that the current CPI is off. We do not know precisely by how much  however. There is  nonetheless  a very high probability that the upward bias ranges between ½ percentage point per year and 1½ percentage points per year. Although this range happens to coincide with the one I gave two years ago  it does reflect both the improvements in the index that the BLS has implemented since then and the emergence of evidence suggesting that the initial problem was of a slightly greater dimension than had previously been estimated. This estimate is consistent with a number of microstatistical studies as well as an independently derived macroevaluation by staff at the Federal Reserve Board  which I will discuss shortly. In judging these evaluations  it is incumbent upon us to resist the evident strong inclination to believe that precision is the equivalent of accuracy in price bias estimation. If we cannot find a precise estimate for a certain bias  we should not implicitly choose zero as though that was a more scientifically supportable estimate. BIS Review 10/1997 - 2 - There is no sharp dividing line between a pristine estimate of a price and one that is not. All of the estimates in the CPI are approximations  in some cases very rough approximations. Further  even very rough approximations can give us a far better judgment of the cost of living  than holding to a false precision of accuracy. We would be far better served following the wise admonition of John Maynard Keynes that “it is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.” Estimates of the magnitude of the bias in our price measures are available from a number of sources. Most have been developed from detailed examinations of the microstatistical evidence. However  recent work by staff economists at the Federal Reserve Board has added strong corroborating evidence of price mismeasurement using a macroeconomic approach that is essentially independent of the exercises performed by other researchers  including those on the Boskin Commission. In particular  employing the statistical system from which the Commerce Department estimates the national income and product accounts  the research finds that measured real output and productivity in the service sector are implausibly weak  given that the return to owners of businesses in that sector apparently has been well-maintained. Taken at face value  the published data indicate that the level of output per hour in a number of service-producing industries has been falling for more than two decades. In other words  the data imply that firms in these industries have been becoming less and less efficient for more than twenty years. These circumstances simply are not credible. On the reasonable assumption that nominal output and hours worked and paid of the various industries are accurately measured  faulty price statistics are almost surely the likely cause of the implausible productivity trends. The source of a very large segment of these prices is the CPI. For this exercise  the study used the GDP chain-weight price measures. Although these price measures are based on many of the same individual price indexes included in the CPI  they do not suffer from upper-level substitution bias. Hence  the price mismeasurement revealed by this data system largely reflects shortcomings in quality adjustment and in the treatment of new goods and services. If  instead of declining  productivity in these selected service industries was flat  to up a modest 1 percentage point per year  the implicit aggregate price bias associated with these service industries alone would be on the order of 1/2 percentage point or so per annum in recent years -- very similar in magnitude to the Boskin Commission estimate of total quality adjustment and new products bias. To be sure  it is theoretically possible that some of the measured productivity declines in these service industries merely reflect mispricing of intermediate transfers among various industries. Such an occurrence would cause an understatement of productivity in some sectors  but a corresponding overstatement in others. But the available evidence suggests that for these particular service industries this theoretical possibility is not of a sufficiently large empirical magnitude to overturn the basic conclusion that there are serious measurement problems in our price statistics. Moreover  the study did not attempt to evaluate possible quality and new products bias in other industries. Some observers who are skeptical that the bias in the CPI could be very large have noted that the evidence on the magnitude of unmeasured quality change and the importance of new items bias is incomplete and inconclusive. Without a doubt  quality change and new items are among the most difficult of the problems currently confronting the BLS. But since I raised this issue two years ago in my testimony before this Committee  a number of studies have BIS Review 10/1997 - 3 - documented significant new examples of cases in which the current treatment in the CPI results in an overstatement of the rate of growth of the cost of living. There doubtless are certain components of the CPI that are biased downward because quality change is handled inappropriately. One instance in which there may well be a problem in this regard pertains to new vehicles  where it may be more appropriate to treat pollution control and mandatory safety equipment  at least in part  as raising price to a consumer rather than improving quality  as is the present practice. But the potential downward bias introduced by current methodology for such equipment can only be slight. We should be prepared to embrace credible new research on quality adjustment  regardless of whether that research points to additional sources of upward bias or previously undetected instances of downward bias. Nonetheless  currently available evidence very strongly supports the view that  on balance  the bias is decidedly toward failing to appropriately capture quality improvements in our price indexes. There is little reason to believe that this conclusion will change unless we alter our procedures. A more difficult quality related issue is whether to reflect changes in broad environmental and social conditions in price measures that are used for indexing various components of federal outlays and receipts. That is  should the CPI reflect the influence of factors such as the level of crime  air and water quality  and the emergence of new diseases  which are not specifically related to products that consumers purchase? There is little in the record to suggest that  when it enacted the indexation of social security benefits in 1972  the Congress intended for the beneficiaries of that program to be compensated for changes in such environmental and social factors. Nor do these issues appear to have been raised when Congress debated the indexation of various tax parameters during the 1980s. Taking account of such conditions  particularly those that lie outside of the markets for goods and services  would be an interesting exercise in its own right  but would appear to extend well beyond the original intent of the Congress. A considerable professional consensus already exists for at least two actions that would almost surely bring the CPI into closer alignment with a true cost-of-living index. First  we should move away from the concept of a fixed marketbasket at the upper level of aggregation  and move toward an aggregation formula that takes into account the tendency of consumers to alter the composition of their purchases in response to changes in relative prices. The BLS already calculates such an index on an experimental basis with a lag of about a year. If the Bureau adopts the Boskin Commission’s recommendation that it publish a “best practice” version of the CPI with a lag of a year  it should  without question  build that index on the foundation of a variable marketbasket. There is a somewhat more difficult issue as to whether the concept of a variable marketbasket can be applied in “real time ” that is  with the same degree of timeliness that characterizes the current CPI. It is not possible to implement the textbook versions of any of the so-called “superlative” those formulas require contemporaneous data on expenditures  and those data are not presently available until about a year after the fact. However  this hardly forecloses the possibility of implementing an approximation to a superlative formula  and work should continue on the development of such an approximation. index formulas time  because in real A second area that will require attention is the aggregation of prices at the most detailed level of the index. This is a highly technical area  and an important example of how research by the staff at the BLS has advanced our knowledge. Without going into the details of BIS Review 10/1997 - 4 - the matter  it is sufficient to say that a selective move away from the current aggregation formula is warranted  and would probably make a modest further contribution to bringing the index more in line with the concept of a cost-of-living index. Beyond these rather limited steps  most of the needed developments will require time  effort  and quite possibly additional resources. It is important that the Congress provide the Bureau with sufficient resources to pursue the agenda vigorously. These are difficult problems  and they cannot be solved tomorrow or next week. But with adequate support and diligent effort  the pace of improvement should quicken. Moreover  an accelerated pace of BLS activity  and heightened congressional interest should galvanize analysts outside the government to contribute to the research effort. Where will this longer-term effort be required? One of the key areas  by all accounts  is quality adjustment. As the Bureau has rightly noted  they do indeed already employ a variety of methods to control for quality change  but available evidence suggests that these are not sufficient to the task. Unfortunately  making improvements on this front will be difficult: Each item will have to be considered on its own  and there may well be limited transfer of knowledge from one item to the next. Another key area on the longer-term agenda will be the estimation of the value of new products to consumers. Significant innovations  such as the personal computer  the cellular telephone  and the heart bypass operation create value for consumers  even at their typically high initial prices; moreover  this value is even greater at the much lower prices that often prevail when new products are  in fact  introduced into the CPI. A true cost-of-living index would reflect this value and its implication for the true rate of growth of the cost of living. The CPI does not reflect it  and accordingly fails to capture a significant offset to price rises in other products. Deriving an estimate of this value and building it into the CPI will not be an easy undertaking. But conceptually  it is unquestionably the right direction to be heading  and some recent research suggests that it could measurably affect the index. Over time  we will need to investigate alternative sources of data. Already  there is interesting work being done to develop techniques for processing data collected from bar-code scanners at the check-out counter. Scanner data will allow the BLS to track not just a small sample of products  but virtually the entire universe of products in selected lines of business and  perhaps most importantly  virtually the universe of transactions  regardless of whether those transactions happen on a weekday  at night  or on a holiday. We should also move to improve our understanding of the value that consumers place on their own time. Absent such knowledge  it will be impossible for the BLS to estimate the value of many goods and services that mainly serve to enhance convenience and save time. Finally  we will have to attempt to build an understanding of why consumers shop at the places they do: What characteristics of an outlet are important  and how much so? Location  hours of operation  inventory  and quality of service all are likely influences on the value that consumers place on their shopping experience  and all will be important in helping the BLS to develop a more sophisticated statistical method for dealing with the appearance of new consumer outlets  including those that operate over the Internet. Even if the BLS moves aggressively  some upward bias will almost surely remain in the CPI  at least for the next several years. Two years ago  in testimony before this Committee  I suggested that a workable structure for dealing with this situation might involve a BIS Review 10/1997 - 5 - two-track approach. That suggestion still seems to me to make sense. The first track would involve action by the BLS to address those aspects of the bias that can be dealt with in relatively short order  say within the next year. The second track would involve the establishment of an independent national commission to set annual cost-of-living adjustment factors for federal receipt and outlay programs. The Commission would examine available evidence on a periodic basis  and estimate the bias in the CPI taking into account both the latest research on the sources and magnitudes of the bias  and any corrective actions that had been taken by the BLS. This type of approach would have the benefit of being objective  nonpartisan  and sufficiently flexible to take full account of the latest information. Moreover  there is no reason why the two tracks could not proceed in parallel. Without the second track  we are implicitly assuming  contrary to overwhelming evidence  that the most accurate estimate of the bias is zero. There has been considerable objection that such a second track procedure would be a political fix. To the contrary  assuming zero for the remaining bias is the political fix. On this issue  we should let evidence  not politics  drive policy. We have an overarching national interest in building a better measure of consumer prices and in implementing more rational indexation procedures. Through these efforts  we are most likely to ensure that the original intent of the relevant pieces of legislation will be fulfilled in insulating taxpayers and benefit recipients from the effects of ongoing changes in the cost of living. At present this objective is not being met. BIS Review 10/1997

A moderate economic recovery continues in Japan as private demand shows increasing firmness. Among final demand items  public-sector investment has begun to decrease while net exports have started to rise. Housing investment has remained at a high level and business fixed investment is also increasing steadily. While the increase in personal consumption has been moderate on the whole  passenger car sales have recently increased at a faster pace. Meanwhile  inventories are generally at appropriate levels. In these circumstances  industrial production is increasing and recently  in particular  the pace of growth has accelerated to some extent. Labor market conditions have continued to improve moderately. Prices have stopped declining on the whole. Domestic wholesale prices (adjusted for seasonal electricity rates) have almost stopped declining  reflecting the depreciation of the yen and the rise in oil prices to date as well as the moderate improvement in domestic supply and demand conditions  particularly in construction goods. The year-to-year decline in corporate service prices is narrowing gradually. Consumer prices (nationwide  excluding perishables) are marginally above the previous year’s level. Land prices continue to weaken on the whole  but there are some signs of improvement in the supply and demand conditions. On the balance of payments  the real trade surplus has recently started to increase and the nominal current account surplus is also rising moderately. 2. In the financial markets  the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) has stayed slightly below the official discount rate  and the 3-month CD rate has remained at 0.50 - 0.55 per cent since autumn 1996. The long-term government bond yield has been declining since July 1996  and it marked a record low of 2.3 - 2.4 per cent in early December and has recently remained at around 2.4 per cent. Stock prices have declined substantially since the end of 1996. The yen has been depreciating since the end of 1996  particularly against the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile  growth in lending by private financial institutions has continued to be slow  owing both to weak corporate demand for new funds and to an increase in capital market financing. Monetary aggregates in terms of M2 + CDs average outstanding  however  have continued to grow at over 3.0 per cent. 3. To gauge future developments of Japan’s economy in the context of individual components of final demand  public-sector investment is expected to show further declines in the coming months. Net exports are likely to continue to increase for some time despite the increase in imports caused by structural factors  as the effects of the yen’s depreciation since 1995 manifest themselves. As for the growth momentum of domestic private demand  corporate profits are increasing reflecting such factors as the depreciation of the yen and the rise in production. The recovery in corporate profits is gradually spreading to the whole corporate sector  including small firms. Reflecting conditions conducive to business fixed investment  such as the increase in corporate profits and progress in capital stock adjustments  business fixed investment on the whole is expected to continue a steady recovery for some time despite the influence of the slowdown in the market expansion in the mobile telecommunications industry. With respect to the household sector  housing investment is unlikely to show significant declines under the generally easy monetary conditions. Personal consumption on average is expected to continue its moderate recovery  reflecting the rise in household incomes and strong demand in areas such BIS Review 10/1997 - 2 - as passenger cars and information-related products  although the consumption tax rate hike will exert some negative influences on consumption growth. However  growth in business fixed investment is still checked as balance-sheet adjustment pressures remain strong. Also  the gains in household incomes are expected to be restrained to some extent as many firms still judge their work force to be excessive. 4. Turning to the outlook on prices  the deceleration in the declining tempo is expected to become more evident. Factors contributing to this include the rise in import prices to date owing to the effects of the yen’s depreciation and the rise in crude oil prices  as well as an improvement in domestic supply and demand conditions. However  prices are unlikely to follow a clear upward trend for some time because of the modest pace of improvements in supply and demand conditions and the intense global competition  but the influence of the accelerated rise in import prices requires careful monitoring. 5. In sum  recovery in private demand shows increasing firmness with a strengthened virtuous cycle that involves production growth. Net exports  which had been exerting a downward pressure on the economy until the middle of 1996  are beginning to support income formation mainly reflecting the yen’s depreciation to date. Considering that the restraining effects from fiscal policy on the economy are likely to strengthen  and that a setback in demand is expected following the surge in anticipation of the consumption tax rate hike  Japan’s economic growth is expected to slow down temporarily in the first half of fiscal 1997. Judging from the above developments  however  the economic recovery on the whole will most likely continue in the future. At the same time  there remain factors  such as balance-sheet adjustment pressures  which tend to keep private demand from gaining strength. Also  the influence of the recent plunge in stock prices on corporate sentiment requires careful scrutiny. In these circumstances  it is essential to promote necessary adjustments by such means as a swift implementation of effective reforms in Japan s economic structure. This is an important ingredient in the efforts to strengthen the basis for medium-term growth in Japan’s economy. BIS Review 10/1997

Introduction 1 The IPF has built up a significant and diverse membership in recent years and has deservedly become one of the most prominent and respected trade associations within your industry. I am delighted to have the opportunity to address you all this afternoon. 2 When Mark Burton suggested that I might look back at developments in the commercial property market during the eight years that I have been doing my present job  that appealed to me because I shall be retiring from the Bank next month. But I also like to look to the future and to identify coming issues and challenges. With that in mind  I will also pick out some of the factors relevant to the industry as it moves forward. The Past 3 My involvement with commercial property began in 1985  when plans for Canary Wharf were beginning to materialise. One of the questions put to the Bank by the developers was whether we would change our policy encouraging banks to have their offices close to the Bank. We recognised that our policy was distorting the market and we decided to make the change. I have followed the property story ever since. But  for today’s purposes  I shall take as my starting point a speech given by the previous Governor to the RICS in Paris in October 1989. You will recall that everything in the garden then seemed rosy. Cranes were everywhere on the horizon; there was an expectation that rents and capital values could only move upwards. Banks were developing innovative financing techniques and competing fiercely with one another to finance all this activity. Income returns were not out of the ordinary but the market was underpinned by the prospect of capital gain. 4 Yet some participants and commentators were beginning to have concerns about the scale of development. The Governor questioned whether there would be sufficient demand for the supply coming on stream. He noted too the banks’ rapidly growing exposure to the sector. The sector was quite simply heading for overcapacity and overgearing. Why did the lenders not see it coming? Perhaps inability or unwillingness to see the big picture was one reason - but more of that later. We have been asked quite often why we as the supervisor of banks did not stop them overlending. The answer remains the same. The banks have to be responsible for their own commercial decisions. We are there to protect their depositors  not their shareholders. But we can usefully draw their attention to gathering clouds - and that is what we did. 5 As we all know  the required level of demand did not materialise. The resultant oversupply of space contributed to one of the most severe downturns that the commercial property industry has ever seen. Since then  other asset classes have outperformed commercial property in most years. Many institutional investors have responded by continuing to reduce their property holdings. Property companies have suffered; we have seen some high profile failures and reschedulings. The banks have suffered very sizeable losses on commercial property. Construction companies and associated professions such as architects and designers have suffered from the reduced workload on commercial property. And we must not forget the BIS Review 11/1997 - 2 - valuing and surveying professions; the upturn in insolvency-related work was not sufficient to offset lower turnover and the corresponding heavy pressure on fees. 6 Possibly the only ones to benefit from the downturn were tenants fortunate enough to sign new leases in an environment of falling rents. The modest extent of subsequent development has probably meant that even these ‘beneficiaries’ have had a more limited choice of accommodation. 7 Other factors have also made the market very challenging  especially for investors and lenders. These have included the speed of building obsolescence and growing pressure on companies to manage property resources more effectively. Several initiatives aimed at enhancing the market’s efficiency and attractiveness made little headway in the first half of the 1990s. These included efforts to enhance liquidity  to develop property derivatives  and to improve information on the very sizeable part of the market that is not ‘prime’. In addition  efforts to enhance transparency have not progressed as well as I myself and many market participants had hoped. 8 There have of course been some positive developments  such as the development by BZW of Property Investment Certificates  the growing importance of data produced by the Investment Property Databank  and the development by RICS of new valuation standards in the revised Red Book. Some of the trade associations  such as the IPF and the Association of Property Bankers  have also developed well and have begun to play a very important role. I believe the Bank of England’s Property Forum  set up in 1993 to bring all sides of the industry together  has also made a positive contribution. But these developments cannot obscure the fact that  on the whole  this period has been one of disappointment. Property’s poor performance in the past few years has undoubtedly caused some to consider very carefully whether or not they wish to remain in property. The Present 9 Are we turning a corner? The commercial property market is important to the UK economy in many ways. Property and related activities such as construction make a significant contribution to GDP. The availability of property of the right standards at the right price is very important to UK competitiveness. This puts some onus on landlords to provide what is wanted. It is equally important that the planning authorities should continue to provide a consistent and flexible planning framework in which developers and landlords can operate and earn a satisfactory return. It is pleasing that the market is at last beginning to show signs of strengthening. Indeed there is some evidence of incipient overheating. 10 Many institutional investors are taking the view that commercial property will be one of the better performing asset classes over the next couple of years and there is significant buying activity both from UK and overseas. There are increasing signs of development  involving both institutional investors and  on quite a large scale  property companies. And the banks too have been showing strong interest in the sector  with many new entrants joining the large number of more established participants. 11 Finally  there are encouraging signs of progress on several initiatives. The IPF has made its case to the Treasury for a change in the tax status of securitised vehicles  and others are looking to develop existing routes. Many investors are telling us that progress on securitisation will be crucial if they are to remain in property at all  so the better tone is not a valid excuse to give up on structural improvements to the market. There is welcome progress on BIS Review 11/1997 - 3 - the derivatives front  through BZW’s Property Index Forward instrument and the REIM initiative. Some participants are showing interest in improving the quality of market information. The Incorporated Society of Valuers and the RICS are funding research by IPD into the performance of the secondary market and  although this project is still in its infancy  I hope very much that you will support these efforts as the project develops. Indeed  on the basis that transparency generally improves the performance of markets  I would  personally  support John Ritblat’s opinion that commercial transaction prices should be made public through the land register. Some of you would lose proprietorial advantage as a result in the short term  but in the long run a more liquid market benefits the most professional more than the free riders. 12 It would  however  be rash to conclude that the market is now unambiguously healthy in all respects. There are still several factors which will continue to pose challenges to the investment  banking and valuing communities. For example  while lease lengths may have temporarily stabilised  break clauses exercisable by tenants are becoming more common. And despite the positive tone of the recent CBI/Grimley survey  it is clear too that many occupiers will continue over the long-term to reduce their needs for space and to demand greater flexibility. Privity of contract has disappeared on new leases. All of these factors are making it less straightforward to form a view of the quality of cashflow likely to stem from a particular building. 13 There is a sizeable overhang of unlet secondary property. The pool of such property increases every time that a major user of space moves into new offices and releases its former premises. While some of the better quality secondary property can be refurbished at an economic price and relet  much of this stock may never again be relet for its present use and may not lend itself readily to conversion for alternative uses. This will continue to exert a dampening influence on the market  and imaginative solutions will be needed. The Future 14 So  the market may be improving but it is still not easy. How is the market likely to develop over the next eight years? What will I be saying if you invite me back in the year 2005? 15 As we all know  the property market has  historically  moved in cycles. Some  notably RICS  have done work to develop our understanding of these cycles. The economic cycle itself is clearly one of the driving factors  though it is clear too that property is subject to its own fluctuations and its own step changes. Contributing factors include the strength of tenant demand  the activities of developers and the willingness of lenders to finance investment and development. 16 My story in the future could be similar - perhaps depressingly similar - to my review of the recent past. Many of the ‘ingredients’ that contributed to the last cycle are certainly present now. Institutional investors are attracted to the sector in the short-term but they could easily resume their longer-term departure from property in a couple of years. This could happen if property’s performance runs out of steam as the economic cycle progresses and other asset classes begin to look more attractive. It is conceivable that the banks might become disillusioned with property again  particularly if they relax their lending criteria too far in the current exceptionally competitive lending market. This could also happen if they are seduced by the outlook for the better properties into taking excessive risks on the secondary and tertiary sectors  for which the outlook generally appears rather less bright. We are in favour of healthy competition among lenders but history suggests that the seeds of tomorrow’s losses are sown BIS Review 11/1997 - 4 - when lenders relax the basics such as loan to value ratios and income cover; or when they take very bullish views on the likely strength of cashflows. We hear that some lenders are seeking to pressurise valuers into higher valuations. This is not a healthy practise and we hope both the lenders and the valuing profession will be strong enough to resist and will stick to the principles of the new Red Book. 17 There are undoubtedly differences between 1989 and this stage of the present cycle  perhaps the most notable of which are the comparatively limited scale of speculative development and more realistic expectations. And notwithstanding my rather jaundiced remarks above about forgotten lessons  some of the risks involved in commercial property are now better understood. This could simply mean that this cycle will repeat history but in a less pronounced way than last time. Perhaps I should at this point recognise the VAT changes announced in the last budget. These have caused a strong reaction from the property industry. They have caused a halt to a number of major deals. I do not know how the matter will be resolved and will not speculate whether the impact will be lasting. More of that no doubt in coming weeks. But are there any other new influences which could bring about a different - and better - outcome than the last cycle? There are at least four other important factors which arguably did not exist in 1989. They may all make the market less volatile in the years ahead. Let me be a bit visionary. 18 The first of these is a low inflationary environment. The political constituency for low inflation is now almost certainly stronger than at any time in living memory. There is a real prospect that a low inflation environment can be sustained into the future. This is a profound change and should help to smooth the path of future economic cycles. This environment is likely to mean slower growth in nominal rents and also less volatile capital values. The emphasis will continue to change from capital gain to running yield. Poor investment or loan decisions will not be forgiven by inflation. This environment will alter attitudes to property  especially among users who will increasingly regard it purely as a factor of production subject to the full disciplines of cost controls. But lower nominal rents need not mean lower real income. 19 The second fundamental difference lies in the role  and potential  of the Private Finance Initiative. In many ways  the PFI simply reflects processes already underway in the private sector whereby occupiers are seeking more flexible arrangements and are prepared to pay a price for changing the traditional relationship between landlord and tenant. It opens up the possibilities for more imaginative use of property  and the principles are applicable both to public and private sector users of property. The providers of services  whether public sector or private  no longer want automatically to own the productive assets needed to provide them. They prefer to rent them instead with a higher level of service as part of the deal. Landlords with property expertise are well placed to provide this wider type of service and have a competitive advantage in doing so compared with less experienced operators. And maybe the word “property” will itself imply something too narrow. Owners will provide a working environment. They may move from “core and shell” to “finish and facilitate”. Indeed in some PFI cases the owners will go even further and operate as well  “provide and process” you might say. This would give outsourcing a new meaning. Perhaps from your point of view it should be called insourcing. If risks are properly identified and priced  the PFI potentially can provide the longer- term bond-type investments that many of you are seeking. It offers great opportunities to all of you. This revolution has only just begun. 20 A third issue that is particularly relevant now is technology. It has undoubtedly contributed to property obsolescence. But technology is potentially an important ally  and in more senses than one. Developments in building and construction techniques  as well as smaller and more powerful machinery and computer technology  facilitate the construction of buildings BIS Review 11/1997 - 5 - that meet occupiers’ needs. Information technology enhances the usability and efficiency of property as an asset class. Just as Mr. Otis made skyscrapers possible  one of you will create completely new configurations of site exploitation - or develop new and integrated relationships between different buildings. The automobile and advertising have entirely altered the shape  size  appearance and location of shops in the USA - and to a lesser extent here. But today’s offices still look pretty much to me like those designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Is there scope for an IT driven revolution in the next eight years in which the working environment is transformed into a virtual reality? I do not know but I am convinced we ain’t seen nothing yet. 21 The fourth factor could make an important difference - greater market liquidity and instruments such as derivatives which will facilitate short-term tactical position- taking or investment. The enthusiasm and momentum for them is apparent both from what the market tells us and from recent surveys. A clear message from our wide range of property contacts is that greater liquidity is essential if commercial property is to remain attractive as an asset class. There is equally a clear message that successful development of securitisation and derivatives will not on its own be the saviour of commercial property. But without it property will not turn in a performance which can stand comparison with competing assets. We need a mature  liquid cash market in property with a healthy derivative market to permit successful management of risk. These are essential characteristics of efficient markets which are necessary for efficient use of property by users as a factor of production. Without such a development there is a risk that the costs of doing business in the UK will be uncompetitively high. I do not know how  or indeed whether  the obstacles to the development of such markets can be easily found. But I regard these issues as nationally important. Conclusion 22 So  what is likely to happen in the next eight years? Let me sum up my vision. 23 The current strong commitment to keeping inflation in check will create conditions more conducive to rational long-term decisions. Commercial property is still to a large extent a longer-term asset and should benefit from this environment. The market will require property investors and owners to recognise and adapt to changing requirements from the users  particularly their increasing wish to manage the risks of property occupation more efficiently. It will require a willingness to work in partnership with tenants and to exploit the benefits of technology to the full. Lenders and other property professionals will need to understand and embrace these changes. I know that some of you already recognise this. Some of you are not afraid of the PFI. We have recently had the end of history  the end of politics. Will the end of distance be next? Will “location  location  location” be replaced by “communications  communications  communications”? 24 This environment offers opportunities which you may - or may not - wish to take. Those who take these opportunities will be the survivors and thrivers. I leave you with my old refrain ringing in your ears: transparency; liquidity; intelligent investment; revenue not capital gain; innovation - all the qualities of a deep  high quality market place.

Phillips  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the Seminar on Banking Soundness and Monetary Policy in a World of Global Capital Markets sponsored by the International Monetary Fund and held in Washington on 28/1/97.,Ms. Phillips examines whether national financial market regulatory systems should be harmonised in the light of international competition Remarks by Ms. Susan M. Phillips  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the Seminar on Banking Soundness and Monetary Policy in a World of Global Capital Markets sponsored by the International Monetary Fund and held in Washington on 28/1/97. It is a pleasure to be here today to discuss a topic that has become more important in a world of global financial markets -- the matter of coordinating and harmonizing our national regulatory systems. On the conference agenda  the topic was phrased as a question  that is  whether we should harmonize our systems. In a sense  the question is somewhat moot -- the globalization of the markets and the breadth of international conglomerate financial institutions is forcing us in that direction. But I would quickly add that one definition of “harmony” is “a pleasing combination of elements.” We can sing compatible and pleasant-sounding notes  without singing the same note. It is in that sense that I believe harmonization of our regulatory systems will develop. In my comments this afternoon  I will mention some of the efforts underway in which the United States is working with other countries to develop more consistent supervisory and regulatory systems  particularly for large financial conglomerates. That experience may provide others with ideas about how they might pursue similar efforts  either on a bilateral or multilateral basis. Perhaps more importantly  though  I will also offer my views on where our interests are likely to be most similar and why and how regulators around the world are likely to continue working toward compatible or “harmonized” systems. Let me begin with those thoughts. The Importance of Compatible Regulatory Regimes One cannot have dealt with U.S. and world financial markets during the past few decades without being thoroughly impressed with the rapid pace of change and the manner in which technology and financial innovation have affected market practice. The improvements in communications and transportation and  importantly  the gains from technology and the miniaturization of the goods we produce have fueled a growing volume of international trade. Our financial institutions  in turn  have sought constantly to find more effective and efficient ways to facilitate and finance these activities  and at the same time manage the related risks. As a result  we have seen dramatic growth in financial derivatives  strong support within the industry for new clearinghouses and netting procedures to reduce counterparty credit risk  a growing need to clarify our laws and regulations regarding financial contracts  and financial markets that are far more closely linked today than they were even a decade ago. In the area of bank regulation and supervision  substantial progress has been made in developing capital standards that help to ensure the financial strength of internationally active banks and that promote greater competition. Simply put  firms in need of international financial services will utilize domestic or foreign financial institutions to the extent their prices are competitive and their financial stability can be assured. As a result  regulators are recognizing the need to harmonize laws and regulations in order to promote economic growth and to deal with important and oftentimes increasingly complex matters that are of common interest to us all. We are recognizing also the need to enhance financial systems -- including supervision and regulation -- in the emerging market economies  primarily for the sake of those economies  themselves  but also because of their increasing importance in international financial BIS Review 11/1997 - 2 - markets. Indeed  G-7 leaders at their summit meeting in Lyon last summer identified this goal as an important element in efforts to promote international financial stability. That we need some level of conformity seems  I’m sure  quite clear. Otherwise  the inconsistency and incompatibility of rules and regulations across countries may make it difficult  if not impossible  for some firms to engage in global business activities. Such barriers are detrimental to the efficiency of international trade and finance  generally. The difficulty  of course  is the precise nature and level of conformity that is necessary to maintain an efficient and equitable world financial system. Here I submit that it may be less important that we standardize particular banking laws and regulations  than it is for us to pursue similar goals  as we independently develop our domestic regulation and supervisory structures. Specifically  if we apply market-based incentives in our regulatory structures  that  alone  should keep our rules sufficiently similar and compatible. We must also recognize that technology and financial innovation are permitting banks today to become ever-more adept at avoiding regulatory barriers and other restrictions that artificially constrain their activities. Moreover  to the extent they are effective  such restrictions can work against local institutions  businesses  or consumers by making banks less competitive internationally or by withholding from their customers the benefits that competition can bring. Regulatory regimes are likely to be more effective in the long run for financial institutions and for domestic economic growth if they are market-compatible. Areas of Common Interests In our roles as central bankers  bank supervisors  and regulators  what are the areas of greatest common interest to us for which we should develop compatible rules and regulations? To keep it simple  let me suggest two. First  to maintain a healthy  responsive  and financially strong banking and financial system will facilitate the growing needs of our domestic economies. Second  to build and maintain an adequate legal and regulatory structure will permit our institutions to compete safely on an equal and nondiscriminatory basis  both domestically and abroad. These thoughts may not sound original; they’re not. They are essentially the two reasons the Basle Committee on Supervision exists  and they underpin most other international efforts to coordinate banking issues. When I consider the past successes in coordinating international bank supervisory or regulatory policies  I think first of the Bank for International Settlements and the work of the supervisors’ committee. After all  the BIS has been the principal forum for developing international supervisory standards for banks in industrialized countries and  by their voluntary adoption  for banks and bank supervisors in other countries throughout the world. Bilateral discussions can also serve useful functions either where particular issues are of concern or as a basis for subsequent broader dissemination. Nearly a decade ago  such bilateral and -- through the BIS -- multilateral efforts produced the risk-based capital standard  known as the Basle Accord. Since then  we have produced numerous other policy statements dealing with sound risk management practices for banks. These statements related first to derivatives activities and most recently involve the management of interest rate risk. Dr. Padoa-Schioppa  chairman of the supervisors’ committee  has probably already discussed these initiatives with you. BIS Review 11/1997 - 3 - One of the Committee’s most recent accomplishments  however  is the development of new capital standards for market risk in trading activities. That standard is notable because it reflects a new approach for constructing international banking standards. In particular  the internal models approach contained within that standard builds on leading industry practices and helps supervisors to promote risk management in banks. Promoting sound risk management is a goal we should all pursue more aggressively in considering new banking policies and regulations. It is also the type of approach I had in mind when I said earlier that our laws and regulations should be compatible with underlying economics and market demands. To the extent we can continue building on “best” or sound banking practices in designing our rules and regulations  we will be working toward a common end. As we work together identifying those practices and deciding how to apply them as supervisory or regulatory standards  we will also be strengthening relations among ourselves that can prove invaluable in times of market stress. Not to over-use the example of the market risk standard  but it illustrates another useful point  as well. Reliance on a bank’s own risk measurement and modeling process in determining regulatory capital standards also acknowledges that no single or specific technique is best for everyone. Each institution should tailor its risk measurement and management process to its own needs. While adhering to basic principles  each institution must determine for itself the proper incentives and techniques for managing its affairs. No two banks or banking markets are identical in their operations  structure  or historical development. Permitting a range of compatible responses to similar situations encourages experimentation  innovation  and growth. Accommodating a certain level of flexibility is necessary for banks  and it is necessary for regulators  too. Indeed  flexibility may be even more important for non-G-10 countries than it is for those of us with large  developed financial systems because of the greater range of capital market and economic infrastructures among developing countries. Materially different situations typically require different solutions. Accommodating differences  though  does not reduce the need for minimum regulatory or supervisory standards based upon well-known principles of sound banking. It is up to supervisors and  if necessary  legislators to craft regulations and laws consistent with internationally recognized standards  but accommodative to local customs and economic needs. In developing sufficiently flexible  market-compatible regulations  I believe we should rely as much as prudently possible on market discipline and on banks’ internal incentives to perform well. This approach requires that the public have information about the risk exposures of banks and about their procedures for managing those risks. As regulators  we can encourage this process by requiring or prodding banks to disclose information to the markets that is both relevant and comparable among institutions. Whether such disclosures are imposed by official regulations or evolve through more subtle efforts  supervisors can help guide the process by considering carefully the kinds of information the private sector needs and that banks use -- or should use -- to manage risk. Even in the United States  where surveys show disclosure is relatively good  supervisors make available to the public data collected on Call Reports. In countries where disclosure practices are minimal at best  bank regulators may be able to perform a particularly important role by publicly disclosing some  if not much  of the information banks report to them. By fueling market information in this way  regulators may BIS Review 11/1997 - 4 - stimulate greater investor interest in banks and the growth of local capital markets. Improved disclosure practices by banks may  in turn  also spill over to other industries. One thing we know for sure is that investors dislike uncertainty. By shedding light on a bank’s condition and future prospects  some of that uncertainty should disappear. While it is important that key prudential standards be sufficiently robust and consistent among countries  certain variations in the details and applications of these standards can be useful. As with private markets  some level of competition among regulators can stimulate improvements and change. I will grant that the United States may take regulatory competition to an extreme  but it also demonstrates  I believe  the advantages that derive from accommodating different views and permitting financial institutions alternative ways to do business. In my view  and considering the political difficulties we have faced in trying to change U.S. banking laws  our current regulatory structure  offering some choice in charter that is administered by multiple regulators  has provided financial institutions with more freedom and expanded powers than they would likely have received with a single regulator. Supervisors must be careful  however  as they try new or different techniques  that they do not impair their oversight efforts or relax them beyond prudent bounds. In such global markets as we have today  weak or ineffective supervision in either large or small countries can have far reaching consequences. Those concerns were at the heart of early work of the Basle Committee and its efforts to identify the respective roles and responsibilities of home and host authorities for internationally active banks. It is important for supervisors to be able to rely on their counterparts in other countries to administer agreed-upon standards of financial institution safety and soundness. Whether we conduct our own on-site examinations  rely on external auditors  or use combinations of other supervisory techniques  we need to assure ourselves that all banking offices are adequately managed and supervised. I would note here that among G-10 countries a more consistent approach may begin to emerge. We in the United States are making greater use of the findings of a bank’s internal and external auditors to guide or supplement our on-site examinations  while some of our counterparts abroad are recognizing more the benefits of on- site exams. Financial Conglomerates Some of the greatest challenges to bank supervisors may arise when organizations link banking activities with other financial or nonfinancial businesses. Such financial conglomerates  which often combine banking  insurance  and securities activities  are not currently allowed to provide a full array of financial services in the United States  but they may do so abroad. The existence of such firms -- and the fact that some of them are headquartered in this country -- have required regulators and supervisors in the United States to work with counterparts abroad to discuss oversight arrangements and develop ways to deal with matters in times of crises. This very issue is one of our current challenges. I have to say that this is not a particularly quick or easy process and is further complicated by the diverse regulatory structures  both here and abroad  involving banking  securities  and sometimes insurance regulators. These discussions often raise difficult issues  since they tend to break new ground in supervision. For example  what approach should be taken regarding nonbank -- or even nonfinancial -- activities of companies that own banks? In the context of these conglomerates  BIS Review 11/1997 - 5 - what does or should “consolidated supervision” mean? Within the context of consolidated supervision  how can the traditional safety-and-soundness approach used by bank supervisors be reconciled with the disclosure/self-regulatory approach used by many securities regulators? Moreover  do the diverse operating structures of conglomerates imply an extension of the safety net that virtually all governments currently extend to banks? One thing is clear: as we address the challenges of promoting a more consistent bank supervisory and regulatory process worldwide  we cannot always take official descriptions of regulatory and oversight regimes at face value. We need to dig deeper to understand how laws are interpreted and how individual banking agencies monitor and enforce safe banking. Different countries necessarily have different banking and financial systems that face unique combinations of exposures and business risks. Even within the United States  for example  we have a relatively uniform supervisory approach for all banks and a risk-based capital standard that applies to them all. In practice  however  the activities of our banks  their capital levels  and their operating practices are quite diverse  and our oversight efforts take those differences into account. Small banks  themselves  recognize the greater risks they face from their lack of size and diversity  and have consistently maintained higher capital ratios than do money center banks. But they also have less formal procedures and internal controls  simply because their staffing and operations are so much smaller. The point is that even a uniform set of rules within a given country can and should be implemented differently as conditions demand. Conclusion It seems clear that as financial markets become more and more integrated  bank regulators around the world will be seeing more of each other than they have in the past. Even in countries that have no internationally active domestic banks  authorities need to ensure that the banks operating in their markets are sound and subject to adequate supervision  whether by home or host authorities. Banks operating imprudently and without proper supervision are the ones most likely to mismeasure their risks  misprice their products  and disrupt the markets. Detecting and deterring such institutions does not require us to have uniform regulatory or supervisory systems  but it does require a certain level of cooperation and coordination and a material level of consistency in our regulatory regimes. Our experience in the United States suggests that achieving an appropriate convergence takes time  not only to develop but to maintain. Progress we have seen through the European Union and the BIS goes far in coordinating  or harmonizing  banking laws  regulations  and operating standards  but that’s just a start. As managers of large financial institutions develop more sophisticated and more comprehensive risk management systems  they are paying less attention every day to the peculiar legal structure of their organizations. As regulators  we need to understand how banking organizations manage and control risks and the full implications of their practices for the financial safety of depository institutions. By doing so  we can do much to protect our own interests while still recognizing and accommodating the business needs of banks. In developing our laws and regulations we need to work together  for sure. But perhaps more importantly  we need to understand the market forces and incentives that banks face. If we keep those factors in mind in developing our individual rules  we may go far in developing regulatory systems that are both compatible among countries and less intrusive to the institutions we oversee.

The 1997 World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings will be held in Hong Kong next year. Mr Liu Zhongli  the Minister of Finance and myself will be there welcoming you as the host of the occasion. I foresee that the Annual Meetings to be held next year will be a magnificent event which commands far-reaching historical significance. This is because the Annual Meetings of the two important international financial organisations are to be held in Hong Kong just a few months after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. Representatives from various countries will have the opportunity to witness the realisation of the principle of “one country  two systems” in Hong Kong. I believe that nobody will wish to miss such an opportunity. Mr Tsang has just expressed his views on the economy of Hong Kong before and after 1997. I would like to say a few words from the perspective of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). I have stated on many occasions that we are confident that after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong  the territory will not only remain prosperous and stable  but its status as an international financial centre will also be further enhanced. And I have good reasons for this confidence. First  there are the strong economic fundamentals of Hong Kong and the entrepreneurial and management skills of the people of Hong Kong. These form the basis for Hong Kong’s continued prosperity and stability and for maintaining Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. As you all know  Hong Kong is an international trade  transport  financial and information centre. With the rapid economic developments taking place in the Asia-Pacific region  Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre will not be weakened; instead  its importance will certainly increase. According to the “Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong” and “The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China”  Hong Kong will become a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China from 1 July 1997. It will enjoy a high degree of autonomy with Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong. Hong Kong will become an independent tariff and trade region and an international financial centre in China but with its own currency. In order to maintain its status as an international financial centre  Hong Kong will inevitably face various challenges. However  Hong Kong will continue to have a sound legal system  advanced communication facilities and infrastructures  professional and management expertise  and strong foreign reserves. Currently  Hong Kong’s foreign reserves rank seventh in the world while China’s rank second. With the backing of such strong economic strength  we are confident that Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre will be maintained and further enhanced. Secondly  from the legal angle  the Basic Law assures the continuation and enhancement of Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. Articles 109 to 113 of the Basic Law lay down specific provisions relating to Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre  its monetary and financial policies  the status of the Hong Kong dollar and the issuing arrangements  capital movements and the role of BIS Review 12/1997 - 2 - the Exchange Fund. These principles establish the basic monetary relationship between China and Hong Kong under the principle of “one country  two systems”  and this can conveniently be summarised as “one country  two currencies  two monetary systems and two monetary authorities” within a sovereign state. It should be pointed out that the co-existence of two currencies  that is  the Hong Kong dollar and the renminbi  is a clear demonstration of the differences between the economies of Hong Kong and the mainland. It is therefore essential that the two monetary systems should be mutually independent. The renminbi will not replace the Hong Kong dollar. We are of the view that the co-existence of two monetary systems is significant to the economic reform of China. It follows from the two mutually independent monetary systems of the mainland and Hong Kong that the two monetary authorities will also be mutually independent and one is not superior to the other. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will be accountable solely to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government from 1 July 1997. The PBOC will not take the place of the HKMA and will not set up any branch office in Hong Kong. I am glad that international organisations and other central banks also acknowledge the mutually independent relationship between the PBOC and the HKMA. Both the PBOC and the HKMA were offered membership in the Bank for International Settlements in early September this year. This shows that the work done by the PBOC and the HKMA are widely accepted and appreciated by the central banking fraternity. This also shows that the international financial community fully supports the principle of “one country  two systems” laid down by the Basic Law. The Basic Law also states that the Exchange Fund shall be managed and controlled by the Hong Kong government. It also states that the revenues of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be used exclusively for its own purposes. In addition  the Basic Law stipulates that the Chinese Government will not levy taxes in Hong Kong. These three-fold safeguards are evidence that China will not interfere with Hong Kong’s financial matters. We have reiterated time and again that under no circumstances will China draw on or resort to Hong Kong’s Exchange Fund or other assets in any way or for any reason. On the contrary  the PBOC will support the currency stability of Hong Kong. The PBOC and the HKMA entered into a bilateral agreement on repurchase of US treasury paper early this year. We also stand ready to provide funds to support the Hong Kong dollar  if necessary. Thirdly  the economic development of the mainland has created excellent conditions for the continuity and further strengthening of Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability. Economic development in the mainland provides a strong support to Hong Kong’s economic development. China is confident in Hong Kong’s maintaining prosperity and stability after 1997 because we have full confidence in the economic development in China. China is firmly committed to continuing with its economic reform and our achievements are widely recognised. Currently  the macro-economic situation in mainland China is steady. The various macro-economic indicators do meet our targets laid down early this year and some even out-perform our expectations. It is anticipated that this year’s economic growth will be around 9%. The retail price is expected to rise by about 7% and is expected to remain steady over the next two years or may even ease further. At present  our foreign reserves are over US$ 90 billion and are expected to exceed US$ 95 billion by the end of this year. Since the beginning of the second quarter this year  external trade has posted some steady growth. There is a significant inflow of capital and our balance of payments is in a healthy position. Therefore the BIS Review 12/1997 - 3 - exchange rate of the renminbi  which is determined by the market  will remain stable. The renminbi  for all intents and purposes has become fully convertible in the current account. We are in advance of our schedule in satisfying the requirement stipulated in Article VIII of the IMF Articles of Agreement. In the next five years  China will continue to adopt an appropriately tight monetary policy. The adoption of this policy means firstly  we will have an appropriately tight monetary stance to keep inflation at a level lower than the rate of economic growth. Secondly  money supply should grow at an appropriate level. In the next five years  the annual growth rate of M1 will be kept at around 18% and M2 at 21% to 23%. Thirdly  reforms and improvements will continuously be made to the approach in making macro-economic adjustment. That is  we will move from reliance on direct control of the volume of credit towards regulating money supply by means of indirect monetary policy instruments such as reserve requirements  open market operations and interest rate policy. Appropriately tight monetary policy is not limited to the control of total credit but also adjustment of the credit structure  deepening of monetary reforms  and timely adjustments to the different aspects of the monetary system. An appropriately tight monetary policy is conducive to the healthy  stable and sustained growth of the national economy. It also helps to create favourable conditions for the resumption of sovereignty and the continued prosperity of Hong Kong. Stability in China is the very basis for Hong Kong’s stability while Hong Kong’s stability will certainly enhance economic reform and developments in China. Foreign investors in Hong Kong will  at the same time  benefit from the stability of China and Hong Kong. Those sceptics who have doubted China’s commitment to the open door policy no longer can have such doubts after witnessing the implementation of our economic reforms and its achievements. I hope you will recognise that China is firmly committed to implementing the principle of “one country  two systems” and maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong  just as we have been firmly committed to the implementation of economic reform in China. The principle of “one country  two systems” is the realisation of the spirit of our constitution and has become a long-term irreversible national policy. As China continues to pursue its economic reform  Hong Kong’s role as the international financial centre in China will become more and more important. We will do our best to help maintain the existing economic system of Hong Kong and keep up its economic dynamism. We also hope that the international financial community will join us in our efforts to maintain Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability. Ladies and gentlemen  when you come to next year’s Annual Meetings in Hong Kong  you will all see for yourselves the realisation of the principle of “one country  two systems” in Hong Kong. In addition  I believe that the 1997 World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings will be an impressive event as a result. BIS Review 12/1997

I would like to thank the Hong Kong Association of Banks for inviting me to Hong Kong to meet with you and to attend this dinner function. Although this is my first visit to Hong Kong since taking up my post in the central bank  we follow closely the economic developments of Hong Kong. All of you have contributed to the prosperity of Hong Kong. I greatly appreciate the wisdom and the spirit of the people of Hong Kong. They are industrious and always striving for the better. Hong Kong’s success is partly attributable to the characteristics of its people. We have good reasons to believe that through our joint efforts  Hong Kong will have an even better future. I would like to take this opportunity to give a brief description of the current situation of the economic and financial reforms in the mainland as well as the basic principles and policies towards the financial relationship between China and Hong Kong after 1997. In addition  I would also say something on co-operation and joint development between the financial sectors of China and Hong Kong. I. Mainland China’s economy is experiencing a stable development First of all  I would like to talk about the financial and economic conditions of China which is a hot topic for discussion among professionals from the Hong Kong financial sector. This is because Hong Kong’s future is closely linked with the economic and financial developments of China. China’s economy began to pick up in 1992 with a dynamic national economy. However  there was also hyper-inflation. During the latter half of 1993  the Chinese Government began to adopt an appropriately tight monetary policy. The adoption of this policy means firstly  price increases should be kept at a level lower than the rate of economic growth. Secondly  the growth of money supply should be slightly above the sum of the rate of economic growth and the target rate of the price increase. Thirdly  indirect monetary instruments should be used more frequently for relating money supply so that the economy will not be too volatile. Our efforts in the past three years are beginning to pay off. We have successfully curbed inflation by making macro-economic adjustments. Firstly  the growth of the money supply has slowed down. It is expected that the total money supply at the end of this year will be 26% higher than the previous year. This growth rate is 3.7% lower than the average annual growth rate during the period under the “Eighth Five- Year Plan”. Secondly  price increases have slackened noticeably. During the period from January to October  retail prices have risen by 6.4% as compared to the same period last year. It is expected that the growth rate for the whole year will be around 6.5%. Thirdly  the economy continues to grow at a relatively high rate. During the period from January to September  GDP rose by 9.6%. It is anticipated that the annual growth rate will exceed 9.5%. BIS Review 12/1997 - 2 - Fourthly  our foreign reserves continue to grow. As at the end of October  our foreign reserves reached US$ 98.8 billion. We are certain that our reserves will exceed US$ 100 billion by the end of the year. The trade surplus is estimated to be over US$ 100 billion this year. There is also US$ 40 billion of foreign direct investment. The supply of foreign exchange exceeds demand and the exchange rate of the renminbi remains stable. Moreover  the renminbi has become fully convertible in the current account. Our experience proves that we are right in adopting an appropriately tight financial and economic policy. Our ability in performing macro-economic operations has improved greatly and our achievements are recognised internationally. Despite the foregoing  several major problems remain to be solved. The percentage of financial revenues in GDP is still falling. The asset quality of banks still needs to be improved. The basic elements of the agricultural sector remain relatively weak and it is unlikely to have any improvement in the operational efficiency of state-owned enterprises in the short run. In view of the current economic situation  the focus of economic and financial reforms in the coming year will be placed on promoting the reform of the economic system and changing the pattern of economic growth. We will continue to adopt an appropriately tight financial and monetary policy. Further efforts will be made to adjust the structure of the economy so as to foster new areas of economic growth. In order to ensure steady growth of the national economy  efforts will also be made to develop domestic as well as overseas markets. Based on the above considerations  it is desirable that next year’s target annual GNP growth rate should be set at 8-9% while the retail price increase be contained at a level below 6%. In order to achieve these targets  the People’s Bank of China is prepared to: 1. Control money supply. Our preliminary proposal is to contain the increase of next year’s total money supply (M2) within the range of 23% to 25%. 2. Adjust the credit structure. The total amount of loans to the agricultural sector will be increased. Economic integration and the setting up of conglomerates will be encouraged. Efforts will also be made to promote the development and sale of residential property. 3. Conduct monetary operations. Employ more frequently monetary policy instruments such as interest rate policy  reserve requirements and open market operations to regulate the money supply. 4. Deepen financial reforms. Reforms of state banks should be stepped up. New commercial banks will be set up. The policy of transforming rural credit co-operatives into co-operative financial institutions will be maintained. Direct financing will be developed in a prudent way with better management. In addition  the financial sector will continue to open up. 5. Foster risk management. Continue the rationalisation of financial order and prevent and eliminate financial risks. It is envisaged that China’s economy and society will continue to develop steadily in the coming years and objectives embodied in the “Ninth Five-Year Plan” can be achieved. China will enter the 21st century with a dynamic economy and society. II. Basic principles and policies governing the financial relationship between mainland China and Hong Kong after 1997 BIS Review 12/1997 - 3 - As China and Hong Kong have different currencies and financial systems  people from Hong Kong as well as the international community are very much concerned with how the principle of “one country  two systems” can be implemented as regards financial issues. It is because the implementation of this principle has direct bearings on the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong as well as the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. “The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China” lays down specific provisions relating to Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre  its monetary and financial policies  the status of the Hong Kong dollar and the issuing arrangements  capital flows and the role of the Exchange Fund. Our national leaders have reiterated on different occasions that the People’s Bank of China  which is the central bank of the People’s Republic of China  should insist on implementing the “Basic Law” and the principle of “one country  two systems”. We should also protect the financial relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland which can be summarised as “one country  two currencies  two monetary systems and two monetary authorities” within a sovereign state and deal with issues relating to this relationship in an appropriate manner. At the IMF/World Bank Annual Meeting which was held in late September this year  I stated in my speech our principles governing the financial relationship between the mainland and Hong Kong. Mr Chen Yuan  the Deputy Governor of the People’s Bank of China  also presented these principles in a systematic manner at the Bank of England seminar which was held in September this year. Both the People’s Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) have been offered membership in the Bank for International Settlements. This is a clear demonstration of the above principles and shows that the mutually independent financial relationship between the mainland and Hong Kong are widely accepted by international financial organisations. Now I am going to give an outline of the main issues relating to the financial relationship between the mainland and Hong Kong after 1997. Hong Kong will continue to maintain its own system of currency issuance and management after 1997. The Hong Kong dollar and the renminbi will circulate as legal tender in Hong Kong and the mainland respectively. Hong Kong’s existing note-issuing arrangements will remain unchanged. Moreover  China supports Hong Kong’s commitment to the maintenance of the linked exchange rate system. It follows from the two mutually independent monetary systems of the mainland and Hong Kong that the two monetary authorities  i.e. the People’s Bank of China and the HKMA  will also be mutually independent. The HKMA will be accountable solely to the Hong Kong Government. The People’s Bank of China will not take the place of the HKMA and will not set up any office in Hong Kong. The People’s Bank of China will strengthen further its present sound co-operation with the HKMA. The HKMA has made great contributions to the stability of the local currency and the supervision of financial institutions. Such efforts by the HKMA help promote the prosperity and smooth transition of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Government will continue to supervise local financial institutions. The supervision will continue to be undertaken in accordance with Hong Kong’s laws and international rules and practices. mainland financial institutions in Hong Kong shall not enjoy any privileges. They shall be regulated by the relevant supervisory authorities in Hong Kong. BIS Review 12/1997 - 4 - The Exchange Fund of Hong Kong shall be managed and controlled by the Hong Kong Government. The financial revenues of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be used exclusively for its own purposes and the Chinese Government shall not levy taxes in Hong Kong. Moreover  China will not draw on or resort to Hong Kong’s Exchange Fund or other assets in any way and for any reason. All financial transactions between the mainland and Hong Kong will be conducted in accordance with the rules and practices of international financial activities. Claims and liabilities between institutions from the mainland and those from Hong Kong will continue to be regarded as external claims and liabilities. When participating in the Hong Kong market  Chinese entities will have equal treatment as other international and local market participants. Apart from the above  it is also important for Hong Kong as an international financial centre to continue to develop its international monetary relations and participate in the activities of international and regional financial institutions. There are therefore provisions in the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law that Hong Kong may  on its own  maintain and develop financial relations with other countries  regions and relevant international organisations after 1997. The 1997 World Bank/IMF Annual Meeting will be held in Hong Kong just a few months after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. This is a magnificent financial event and I am confident that it will be successful. III The strengthening of financial co-operation and the promotion of economic prosperity and stability between the mainland and Hong Kong Mainland China and Hong Kong have close financial links with each other. Since the implementation of financial reforms and the open-door policy  such links have been strengthened further. It is necessary to further enhance such a mutually beneficial relationship between the two places. First of all  the mainland and Hong Kong should work together for the prosperity  stability and smooth transition of Hong Kong. China’s commitment to the implementation of the “one country  two systems” principle is increasingly accepted and appreciated by the people of Hong Kong and the international community. Worries and doubts about the future of Hong Kong which emerged in the early 1980’s have largely subsided. We are pleased to note that the financial situation in Hong Kong is heading towards a smooth transition. We are confident that Hong Kong will enjoy financial stability before and after 1997. Even though there may be some fluctuations in Hong Kong’s financial market  we believe that the HKMA is fully capable of handling these situations satisfactorily. If necessary  the People’s Bank of China will  at the request of the HKMA and in accordance with the Basic Law and market practices  offer support to the HKMA. Financial stability in Hong Kong before and after 1997 is not only essential to the prosperity of Hong Kong and China but also to financial stability in the Asia-Pacific Region. We are confident that the international financial community  including the central banks in the Asia-Pacific Region  will be actively involved in the efforts to maintain Hong Kong’s financial stability. Secondly  the two places should work closely together to maintain and enhance Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. Hong Kong has some unique competitive advantages in being an international financial centre in a number of aspects such as opportunities  geographic location and people. I have made it clear to the international financial community on many occasions that after China’s resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong  the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre will not be undermined but  rather  it will be further strengthened. This is because the many unique advantages which Hong Kong enjoys now will BIS Review 12/1997 - 5 - continue to exist after 1997. There is also the Basic Law which guarantees that Hong Kong will remain unchanged. More importantly  with the sustained  rapid and healthy growth of the economy in China - the vast hinterland at the back of Hong Kong - numerous opportunities will be created for Hong Kong’s financial sector. All these are favourable conditions for the maintenance and strengthening of Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. Economic developments in the mainland have given rise to strong demand for funds and Hong Kong will continue to be our major funding centre. We will strengthen our coordination and co- operation with Hong Kong in areas such as the development of markets and infrastructures in response to the needs of financial developments in both places. I have met with many central bankers and major international bankers and they all agreed that Hong Kong should be able to maintain its status as an international financial centre as regards the future relationship between Hong Kong and Shanghai. I think as a national economic centre  Shanghai’s financial status will become increasingly important. However  it will not be possible for Shanghai to become an international financial centre in the longer term and it will not replace Hong Kong. Thirdly  the mainland and Hong Kong should co-operate fully with each other so as to promote prosperity and stability. Since the implementation of economic reforms and the open- door policy  financial co-operation between the two places has been strengthened which  in turn  helps to develop economic and trading ties. At present  China and Hong Kong are each other’s major investment and trading partner. As at the end of 1995  Hong Kong’s total cumulative investment in China reached US$ 78.6 billion  accounting for 58% of total foreign investment in China. In 1995  90% of the syndicated loans to China were arranged in Hong Kong and 90% of the Chinese companies listed on overseas stock markets have their primary listing in Hong Kong. The volume of import and export trade between the two places amounted to US$ 44.6 billion last year  accounting for 15.9% of China’s total external trade. If Hong Kong’s entrepôt trade which came from China is also taken into account  the figure reached US$ 124.1 billion  accounting for 34.1% of Hong Kong’s total external trade in that year. The number of mainland financial institutions in Hong Kong is on the rise and vice versa. These institutions are going to provide a whole range of financial services which are conducive to the continuous and stable development of the economic relationship between the two places. China will further open up its financial markets. This includes the opening up of more districts  the gradual relaxation of renminbi business and the gradual introduction of the investment banking mechanism. The Hong Kong financial sector will directly benefit from these moves since they will offer numerous business opportunities. In the course of stepping up our pace of financial reforms  we have to keep on learning from advanced international management experience and to provide training to outstanding personnel. We hope that the financial community in Hong Kong will provide us with assistance and support in these areas. Before ending my speech  I would like to point out that the Hong Kong Association of Banks has contributed a lot in assisting the HKMA to ensure the financial stability of Hong Kong. I hope all of you will continue to give your support to the HKMA and play a more active role in promoting economic and financial developments in Hong Kong and its smooth transition. I would also like to announce that an association of mainland banks will be formed this year. I hope that the two banking associations will strengthen their exchanges and co-operation and work together for a more prosperous future. A delegation from the Hong Kong Association of Banks will visit Beijing in a few days. I would like to welcome the delegation on behalf of the People’s Bank of China. I will meet with some of you again on that occasion. We can further exchange views on the strengthening of co-operation between the banking sectors on the mainland and in Hong Kong.

INTRODUCTION In less than three hundred days  China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. Given Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre  it is natural for the international investment community to be interested in the future of Hong Kong. I am grateful to Governor George for giving me this opportunity to share with this distinguished audience the Chinese Government’s policy on the monetary relationship between the mainland of China and Hong Kong after 1997. By way of introduction  let me first explain the origin of the basic principle of “one country  two systems”  which forms the backbone of China’s policy towards the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region as from 1 July 1997. This will help people to understand why China is so committed to implementing this very important principle in Hong Kong. THE “ONE COUNTRY  TWO SYSTEMS” PRINCIPLE What does “one country  two systems” mean? It means that after 1997  the socialist system and policies shall not be practised in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years. This principle was not a compromise solution reached in the Sino-British negotiations for political expedience. It was not even an idea floated by the British side. It was in fact a paramount guiding principle adopted by the Chinese Government for advancing the unification of China. The principle was also the outcome of intense research by the Chinese Government on what factors contributed to the economic success and stability of Hong Kong and how they could be preserved beyond 1997. We are convinced that this principle would serve not only China’s long-term national interest but also that of Hong Kong. It was against this background that the Chinese Government put forward in the negotiations the concept of “One Country  Two Systems” and the guiding principles. These were subsequently incorporated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984 and then in the Basic Law promulgated by our National People’s Congress in 1990. I should add that the principle of “one country  two systems” as a fundamental policy for the unification and development of China has been written into our country’s constitution and become a long-term irreversible national policy. The Sino-British Joint Declaration is a treaty registered with the United Nations. The Chinese Government is committed to implementing fully and faithfully the provisions of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. My second point is that notwithstanding our commitment  there is no lack of sceptics who doubt that the Chinese Government would abide by the Basic Law and fulfil its commitments after 1997. This brings to mind those sceptics who doubted China’s commitment to the open door policy and the economic reform which China initiated in late 1979. Such critics thought that the problems faced by China in the reform process were so huge that we were doomed to fail. They also doubted how our economic reform could square with China’s socialist economy. Today  you and I can both see that these critics have been proven wrong. BIS Review 12/1997 - 2 - Between 1979 and 1995  China’s GDP has increased by an average of 9.9% every year and the standard of living has improved significantly. The economic and monetary conditions and the legal and institutional reform of our financial sector have made progress beyond the expectations of many. China’s foreign reserves reached a record high of US$ 90.7 billion in early August 1996. The critics are right in pointing out that China is a vast country  with a large population of over 1.2 billion people. It is natural that in the implementation of our reform we could run into difficulties of one sort or another. At times we need to adjust our pace a bit to resolve those problems but there is no question that China is firmly resolved to continuing with economic reform. Equally  China remains firmly and totally committed to maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong  in accordance with the provisions of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. I am sure that the facts and events will demonstrate that the sceptics will once again be proven to be wrong. Ladies and gentlemen  let me now proceed to outline first the legal and policy framework and then the seven basic principles governing the monetary relationship between the mainland of China and Hong Kong. Finally  I will describe China’s policy on Hong Kong’s participation in international and regional financial institutions and forums. THE LEGAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORK According to the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law  Hong Kong will enjoy autonomy in all areas other than foreign affairs and defence matters. The key provisions on the monetary and financial sides provide that: The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall provide an appropriate economic and legal environment for the maintenance of its status as an international financial centre. Hong Kong shall  on its own  formulate monetary and financial policies  safeguard the free operation of financial business and financial markets  and regulate and supervise financial activities in accordance with the law. The Hong Kong dollar  as the only legal tender in Hong Kong  shall continue to circulate  and the existing currency issue mechanism shall continue. The Hong Kong dollar shall remain freely convertible  with free flow of capital and no exchange controls. The Exchange Fund  which holds Hong Kong’s foreign reserves  shall be managed and controlled by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  primarily for regulating the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. The above provisions form the foundation for defining and establishing the monetary relationship between the mainland and Hong Kong under the principle of “one country  two systems”. Under these provisions  this relationship can be best summarised as one country  two currencies  two monetary systems and two monetary authorities  under two different social and economic systems within a sovereign state. SEVEN PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE MONETARY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MAINLAND AND HONG KONG I will now set out the seven principles governing the monetary relationship between the mainland of China and Hong Kong. BIS Review 12/1997 - 3 - The first principle concerns the relationship between the two currencies and between the two monetary systems. According to the Basic Law  Hong Kong will continue to maintain its own system of currency issuance and management after 1997. The Hong Kong dollar and the renminbi will circulate as legal tender in Hong Kong and the mainland respectively. The Hong Kong dollar will be treated as a foreign currency in the mainland. Likewise  the renminbi will be treated as a foreign currency in Hong Kong. The three note-issuing banks in Hong Kong will continue to issue Hong Kong dollar bank notes  with 100% backing by US dollars under the linked exchange rate system. The currency in circulation in Hong Kong is in fact backed over five times by foreign reserves. Here I would like to stress that China supports Hong Kong’s commitment to the maintenance of the linked exchange rate system  which has served Hong Kong well by providing monetary stability since its introduction in 1983. Corresponding to the two currencies will be two monetary systems. They possess their own characteristics  reflecting the differences between the two economies. The two monetary systems are of equal importance to China in its reform and liberalisation. One does not precede or be subsidiary to the other. They will operate in a mutually independent manner. The second principle relates to the relationship between the two monetary authorities. It follows from the two mutually independent monetary systems of the mainland and Hong Kong that the two monetary authorities will also be mutually independent. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will be accountable solely to the Hong Kong government. The People’s Bank of China will not take the place of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and will not set up any office there. As Hong Kong and the mainland develop increasingly close economic ties in both trade and investment  close co-operation between the two monetary authorities becomes even more important. The two monetary authorities must  therefore  strengthen further the present sound co-operation of central banking functions  including monetary management  banking supervision and the development of the financial infrastructure. The third principle concerns co-operation in prudential supervision. According to the Basic Law  the Hong Kong government will continue to supervise financial institutions in Hong Kong  including financial institutions from the mainland. Supervision will continue to be undertaken in accordance with international rules and practices. Notwithstanding different business practices in the mainland and Hong Kong  we have reached consensus on licensing procedures and supervision of each other’s financial institutions. It has been agreed that : Financial institutions based in the mainland and Hong Kong setting up offices in each other’s territory shall be approved on the same basis as foreign financial institutions. The mainland offices of Hong Kong-based financial institutions shall continue to enjoy the same preferential treatment in the mainland as other foreign financial institutions. mainland financial institutions in Hong Kong shall not enjoy any privileges. They shall abide by the law of Hong Kong and be regulated by the relevant supervisory authorities in Hong Kong. BIS Review 12/1997 - 4 - This arm’s length treatment will certainly help to underscore the implementation of the “one country  two systems” principle. The fourth principle is that the People’s Bank of China will support the currency stability of Hong Kong. On behalf of the PBOC  I have early this year signed a bilateral agreement with the HKMA on the repurchase of US treasury paper. We are prepared to offer liquidity support to the HKMA for the purpose of stabilising the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. We also stand ready to use our foreign reserves to support the Hong Kong dollar  if necessary. However  I must point out that under no circumstances will China draw on or resort to Hong Kong’s Exchange Fund or other assets in any way and for any reason. I mentioned earlier that the Basic Law states that the Exchange Fund shall be managed and controlled by the Hong Kong government. It is also stated that the financial revenues of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be used exclusively for its own purposes. In addition  the Basic Law stipulates that the Chinese Government shall not levy taxes in Hong Kong. These triple safeguards are evidence that China does not have its eyes on siphoning off the resources of Hong Kong. The fifth principle relates to the treatment of financial business between China and Hong Kong. After 1997  all financial business between the two places will be conducted in accordance with the rules and practices of international financial activities. Claims and liabilities between banks and companies from the mainland and those in Hong Kong will continue to be regarded as external claims and liabilities. When raising funds in Hong Kong  Chinese entities will have equal treatment as other international and local market participants  without any special privileges. Disputes relating to contracts between banks and companies of the mainland and those of Hong Kong shall be handled in accordance with international practice. Where China’s Arbitration Law and other relevant laws and regulations are applied  the provisions relating to arbitration involving foreign parties will apply. The sixth principle is about the standing of mainland financial institutions in Hong Kong. As discussed earlier  mainland financial institutions in Hong Kong must abide by the law of Hong Kong and be regulated by relevant regulatory authorities there. I would like to stress that the Bank of China group  though being one of the three note-issuing banks and a leading commercial bank in Hong Kong  shall not be treated more favourably than other banks. It shall not carry out any activities beyond the role of a commercial bank. The seventh principle is on the complementarity between Shanghai and Hong Kong. As you know  Shanghai used to be China’s financial centre. With China’s deepening reforms and open-door policy  Shanghai is becoming a vibrant city with tremendous potential for further development. To a certain extent  Shanghai has met the conditions for reviving herself as a financial centre. While there are concerns as to whether Shanghai will replace Hong Kong  I would like to emphasise that these are groundless speculations because the Basic Law has already stipulated that Hong Kong shall maintain its status as an international financial centre. We are of the view that Hong Kong and Shanghai will have a complementary and mutually reinforcing relationship. In the short run  and at least before the renminbi becomes fully convertible  it will not be possible for Shanghai to become an international financial centre. Given the size of China’s economy  there is plenty of room for more than one financial centre. BIS Review 12/1997 - 5 - Hong Kong and Shanghai will likely become two complementary and mutually reinforcing financial centres that will each develop with its own characteristics. HONG KONG IN INTERNATIONAL MONETARY RELATIONS Apart from these seven principles  it is also important for Hong Kong as an international financial centre to continue to develop its international monetary relations and participate in the activities of international and regional financial institutions  central bank forums etc. There are therefore provisions in the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law that Hong Kong may  on its own  maintain and develop financial relations and conclude and implement agreements with other countries  regions and relevant international organisations  using the name of “Hong Kong  China”. Some international financial organisations restrict their membership to sovereign states. In those cases  where negotiations are held on matters involving Hong Kong  the Chinese Government would normally consult Hong Kong and include its representatives in the Chinese delegation. When entering into international financial agreements which may involve Hong Kong  the Chinese government will first seek the views of Hong Kong before deciding whether such agreements will apply to it. Taken together  these provisions will enable Hong Kong to continue and also develop its current international monetary relationship. PROSPECTS FOR HONG KONG AFTER 1997 I believe Hong Kong will remain prosperous and stable after 1997. Why? This is because: First  the strong economic fundamentals of Hong Kong and the entrepreneurial and management skills of the people of Hong Kong are the basis for its continued prosperity and stability. Secondly  the Basic Law has provided a legal safeguard for the maintenance of the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. Thirdly  the economic development of the mainland has created excellent conditions for Hong Kong’s continued prosperity and stability. As pointed out by China’s Vice- Premier Zhu Rongji at his meeting on 29 May this year with senior officials of four main financial regulators and institutions from Hong Kong including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - China is confident in Hong Kong’s maintaining prosperity and stability and its status as an international financial centre after 1997 because we have full confidence in the economic development of China. As Hong Kong will continue its role as an international financial centre  it will become the most important funding centre for China and very likely for the Asian region as a whole. With the ongoing reform and open-door policy  the mainland of China has achieved sustained and strong economic growth. Our target for economic growth in 1996 is 8% but it could exceed 9%. Inflation should be within the range of 7 to 8% for 1996. BIS Review 12/1997 - 6 - The mainland of China’s growth will obviously benefit Hong Kong’s economy tremendously as we are its largest trading partner. The mainland of China is also one of the leading investors in Hong Kong  with total investment reaching US$ 25 billion last year. At the same time  Hong Kong has also contributed greatly to the mainland of China’s reform and modernisation  both in terms of investment and know-how. Hong Kong is the largest investor in the mainland. Total cumulative direct investment from Hong Kong has now reached US$ 78.6 billion  accounting for 58% of total foreign direct investment. In 1995 alone  about half of the foreign direct investment in the mainland came from Hong Kong  which amounted to some US$ 20 billion. Also  for the 23 Chinese companies listed on overseas stock markets  the trading of such overseas stocks is most active in Hong Kong. Out of the 23 companies  21 had their primary listing in Hong Kong. As China continues with its financial and economic reforms  Hong Kong’s role as a financial centre for China will become even more important. It is therefore vital that Hong Kong remain the vibrant financial centre with its own economic system that we know now. We certainly would not do anything which would jeopardise Hong Kong’s prospects. To conclude  I have no doubt that Hong Kong will continue to do well after 1997 as it has done in the past three decades during which Hong Kong survived numerous shocks and market turbulence. History has shown that Hong Kong has been extremely resilient to external shocks and was able to regain its vitality and competitiveness through swift internal adjustments. Investors who had the foresight and wisdom of capitalising on the opportunities in Hong Kong have done well and will be able to continue to share in the prosperity of Hong Kong. Ladies and gentlemen  1997 is not a time when Hong Kong will need a miracle in order to survive the transition. I hope you will also come to the conclusion that China  particularly Hong Kong  offers tremendous business potential for investors  both local and overseas. BIS Review 12/1997

George  at the Bankers Club Annual Banquet held in London on 3/2/97. I’ve been a follower of Jim Wolfensohn for the past 20 years  and it is a great pleasure to follow him again this evening. I first came across him when he was an extraordinary investment banker - reputedly flying the world with his cello strapped securely in the adjacent seat. His eventual appointment to the Presidency of the World Bank was inspired. He brings to it an outstanding professionalism. But - as you have heard this evening - he brings to it also a broad humanitarian vision and total commitment to the World Bank’s task of improving the lives of people in those parts of the world that still need outside official help with their reconstruction and development. President Wolfensohn’s canvas tonight has been global. My own focus will be on Europe  and in particular on European monetary union - though it’s fair to say that EMU could well have significant consequences for the global economy. This country is widely regarded elsewhere in Europe as being bloody-minded and even obstructive about monetary union  largely because there is indeed an intense  and often impassioned  debate going on here about the pros and cons. And so there should be. It’s a momentous enterprise  with potentially enormous implications for Europe’s political and economic future. The simple fact is that there are real risks as well as real potential benefits in monetary union; and it would be foolhardy just to assume that the enterprise  if it is embarked upon  will inevitably bring about the political harmony and economic prosperity across Europe that anyone in their right mind wants to see. It is hugely important to all of us that Europe’s political leaders stand back and weigh the risks as well as the potential benefits  dispassionately  before any irrevocable step is taken. If the debate in this country encourages open debate elsewhere then we will be doing a service to Europe as a whole. It is something of a fashion these days to describe economic conditions in terms of fairy stories. I have heard the steady expansion in the United States  and more recently in this country  described as the “Goldilocks” condition - with the economic temperature not too hot  not too cold  but just right. In the same vein I might describe European monetary union as Beauty and the Beast. The Beauty of it lies in intra-European exchange rate certainty. And if you don’t find that instantly seductive I suggest you speak  as I have  to some of Britain’s exporters. They have seen  over the past six months or so  an erratically sharp appreciation of sterling  against the core European currencies in particular  which can’t be adequately explained in terms of economic fundamentals. But Beauty comes in a package along with the Beast  and the Beast in this case is the single monetary policy - the single  one-size-fits-all  interest rate. The trouble is that it may not in the event suit the domestic monetary policy needs of the different individual Euro-area countries. And if you don’t find that instantly repulsive I suggest you ask yourself how  at this particular juncture  we could keep the economic porridge - if I may mix my fairy stories - at just the right temperature if we were obliged now to have German-level interest rates. Now you can’t just hope the Beast will never appear. I don’t know of any serious analysis that doesn’t acknowledge that tensions could arise between the domestic policy needs of BIS Review 14/1997 - 2 - the different member countries - as a result of different cyclical positions  or different fiscal policies  or as a result of external shocks which affect some member countries more than others  or as a result of structural changes in one member country as against another. The risks  like the potential benefits  are  as I say  real. You might more reasonably hope that Beauty’s Beast will turn into Prince Charming - and that all their problems turn out to be little ones. But I have to tell you that it was always at this point in the story that I began to wonder if my mother was making it all up! In any event  you need to be rather confident that the potential tensions are indeed likely to be minor  or at least short-lived  because  if they do turn out to be serious  then you could be stuck either with a weak Euro - and more rather than less inflation  higher rather than lower interest rates over the medium-term  and exchange rate instability against outside currencies - or  if the European central bank is allowed to do its job in accordance with its statutes  you could be stuck with persistent stagnation and unemployment across the economically weaker parts of the Euro-area. It’s not enough  it seems to me  to shrug one’s shoulders and say “well  that’s what happens now anyway within individual countries”; at least within individual countries there are alternative adjustment mechanisms  in the form of labour mobility and fiscal redistribution  to moderate the tensions  which will be much less effective within the Euro-area. The architects of the Maastricht Treaty clearly knew all about the Beast  and they evidently shared my scepticism about it turning naturally into Prince Charming. The famous convergence criteria are there precisely in order to reduce the risks of tensions emerging after the start of the Euro. One can argue about how far they do in fact reduce the risks. But it would be a reckless gamble to charge ahead if even those criteria were not met - sustainably  and in substance rather than just in form. So there needs to be a serious debate. But it would be disappointing if that debate degenerates into recrimination and antagonism. That would be to obscure the remarkable consensus that now exists - throughout the European Union and indeed more widely  and across a broad spectrum of political opinion within the countries of Europe  including this country  on the broad approach to macro-economic management. This unforced consensus extends to monetary policy directed to price stability  and it extends to budgetary policy directed to medium and longer-term fiscal sustainability. There is growing recognition  too  across the continent  of the importance of structural policy directed to supply-side flexibility. This strengthening consensus is fundamentally important - more fundamentally important  in terms of the economics of it at least  than whether these common objectives are pursued inside or outside the framework of monetary union. Pulling these thoughts together  it would be a mistake in my view for monetary union to go ahead without reasonable confidence of genuine  sustainable  convergence between its members; and it would be a mistake for any individual country to seek to join  or to be permitted to join  unless it had achieved genuine  sustainable  convergence. If there are serious doubts - generally or in any particular case - it would be in no-one’s interest to proceed. But it would be just as big a mistake  if monetary union does not go ahead  or for countries on the outside  if individual governments saw that as an opportunity to seek to take short-term advantage of the apparent macro-economic freedom that that gave. It would be against their longer-term national economic interest; and countries behaving in this way should not be at all surprised if other European Union countries sought to protect themselves against disruptive behaviour. With or without monetary union  within it or outside  it is of overriding importance that we all continue to pursue stability-orientated macro-economic policies. On that BIS Review 14/1997 - 3 - basis I can see no reason  and certainly no right under the Treaty of Rome  for distinctions to be made among the member states of the European Union whatever the outcome on monetary union. Indeed we would all suffer if they were  because it would reduce the potential benefits of the single market to Europe as a whole. Whatever the surrounding noise  we must surely be smart enough to avoid cutting off our nose to spite our face in that way. Our national and collective economic interests are too closely aligned for that to be allowed to happen. So I am not particularly impressed either by the fears sometimes expressed about the economic penalties that will be visited on countries outside monetary union  or by the occasional rattling of the cage to try to bully them into it. Unless we are convinced  as I say  in general or in any particular case  that Beauty will in fact end up with Prince Charming  and not be condemned to long-term cohabitation with the Beast  then it would be better for Europe as a whole to delay until we were more confident of a happy ending. Investment will continue to flow to this country so long as we succeed in maintaining an environment offering attractive returns  and our macro-economic and supply-side policies are a much bigger factor in that than the exchange rate. Similarly the City will continue to flourish as Europe’s international financial capital so long as the strongest financial firms from all around the world continue to find it attractive to conduct their business here. I see no signs of that changing: indeed the international business of the City continues to increase; and that has very little to do with our national currency  or with an expectation that we will be among the first to merge it into the Euro. So long as we are properly prepared  as we will be  and so long as we have in place efficient infra-structure  including for payments and settlements  as I assure you we will have - in or out  then the Euro  if it comes  will be more of an opportunity than a threat to the City. There are those who sometimes give the impression that they think the Euro could - by regulation or restrictions - be confined to within the territory of the Euro area  and that this would be “a good thing”. That I have to say is not our experience. In practice unnecessary or ineffective domestic regulations or restrictions have often been the cause of financial activity growing up elsewhere. In any event we live in a global financial world and the Euro is bound to become a widely-used and actively-traded currency internationally. Its liquidity is likely to be a key attraction to domestic and foreign users alike. The City of London both contributes to  and thrives upon  liquid markets  and the Euro-market  or the euro-Euro-market if we are an “out”  will be no exception. That can only be good for the development of financial activity - the provision of competitive financial services - across Europe as a whole  because we are not talking here about a zero-sum game. Euro-activity in London is likely to stimulate financial activity in other centres and vice versa; and much of that activity will be undertaken by branches or affiliates of the same major financial firms. The first ecu-Euro bond raised last week by a European borrower and managed from London by a Swiss/British and a French bank and by another French bank in Paris  is a good example not just of London’s international role as it is today  but of how it is likely to continue. In this area  too  therefore I see our national interests coinciding rather than conflicting with the collective European interest. That is why the Bank of England  at all levels  is playing a full  active  and constructive  part in both the preparatory work of the EMI  and in the technical preparation of London’s great financial markets. If monetary union goes ahead  with or without the UK  we have a vital interest in its success  and we will do all that we can to ensure that outcome. BIS Review 14/1997 - 4 - Mr President  I am delighted to see so many bankers from around the world here again this evening - and generally looking so prosperous. And  come what may in relation to EMU  I confidently look forward to seeing you all at this great banquet again next year  and for many years to come - looking just as prosperous. It is in that context that I ask you to rise and join me in a toast to the Bankers Club - coupled with the name of its President  Sir William Purves. BIS Review 14/1997

First a word of thanks for the invitation to talk with you about Sweden and the European Economic and Monetary Union. Today I have chosen to consider this matter from three angles: general aspects of the issue of Sweden and EMU; the work we did last year in the Union to prepare for EMU; and some consequences of EMU for Sweden’s financial sector. The EU’s preparations for the economic and monetary union are continuing. The member states are doing all they can to fulfil the economic criteria for participation in the euro area. Along with this  intensive political work is being done to remove any remaining obstacles. After the latest meeting of Heads of State or of Government  in Dublin last December  political agreements are in place on  for example  the stability and growth pact and the relationship between the euro and outside currencies. Solutions are still required on a number of important issues. One is how the path into EMU is to be arranged for countries that do not belong to the first group. Then there are many technical details to adjust in the course of the year. But the puzzle’s main pieces are now in place. EMU - an important part in EU cooperation When asked about the likelihood of EMU being actually established on time  some observers declare that “the EMU process has reached a point of no return”. I neither can nor want to be so categorical. But that EMU will be realised on time in accordance with the Treaty does seem highly probable. The political determination is strong  as has been demonstrated time and again when conflicting views threaten the process. I am glad the debate has now started in Sweden and that it is concentrating to a greater extent on the consequences for Sweden of joining the monetary union or remaining outside  rather than on whether the EMU project as such is good or bad. What I still lack in the debate is an appraisal of EMU in a broader policy perspective. The purpose of the economic and monetary union is the same as for the European Union: closer European cooperation on such areas as integration  growth  employment and prosperity. The European Union is often discussed in Sweden in terms of a Brussels bureaucracy that deals with the length of cucumbers or the curve of bananas. That is of course both incorrect and unfortunate. The Union should be seen as an arena or  if you like  a playing field. For some years now Sweden has been a player  which involves learning the rules and taking initiatives for the development of Europe in concert with other countries. But this presupposes that  instead of again remaining outside  we participate in the contexts where developments are constructed. Opportunities and risks The idea behind a single currency in Europe is simple. One currency is better than many - it makes things work more efficiently. Eliminating the need to exchange currencies reduces transaction costs. The exchange rate stability facilitates trade and investment. A single currency makes price comparisons and economic estimates easier  not least for small and BIS Review 14/1997 - 2 - medium-sized companies. More direct price comparisons should lead in turn to stronger competition and downward pressure on prices  to the benefit of consumers. But risks are also involved when a single currency is introduced in so many countries with geographical  cultural and institutional differences. The Calmfors report has highlighted the insurance argument. I agree that this is an important point against EMU and therefore warrants particular attention. Monetary and exchange rate policy can be used as a kind of insurance against major  unforeseeable shocks in a single country. Without it  large adjustments may be required in other parts of the economy. However  when Calmfors and others claim that country-specific shocks have been more frequent in the Swedish economy than in the EU’s core countries  they are on uncertain ground. There are many indications that the shocks in Sweden have been occasioned above all by domestic economic policy and other institutional conditions  in the labour market and in wage formation. Wage costs in Sweden rose considerably faster than in other countries in the 1970s and 1980s; competitiveness was restored by resorting to devaluations. It is not self-evident that shocks generated externally would hit Sweden more seriously than countries which are currently taken as given for EMU. So the risk of what economists call asymmetric shocks in Sweden should not be exaggerated. Moreover  when it comes to influencing production and employment in the event of major shocks  monetary policy has a limited capability. It may even be the case that independence in monetary policy increases the risk of self-inflicted shocks. In the longer run  monetary policy is not a substitute for the changes that need to be made  for instance to improve wage formation and the workings of the labour market. The Governing Board of the Riksbank will shortly be submitting an opinion on the Calmfors report. The arguments for and against EMU participation will be considered there at greater length. A general theme in the report is that every kind of decision - to joint now  to join later or to stay outside - entails risks and has a price. Although the report conclude that Sweden should wait joining EMU for the time being  not much is needed to tip the scales the other way  for example if EMU begins with more participants than the core countries or if the alternative of remaining outside does not confer any substantial freedom in monetary policy. But as I said  there will be occasion to return to this. Preparatory work in the EU The preparatory work is in full swing in all the EU institutions as well as in the member states. The EMU project will not founder on technical aspects. In May 1995 the Commission presented a green paper on the practical arrangements for a changeover to the single currency. At the Madrid meeting that year the European Council adopted the scenario for the changeover  specifying dates for the central decisions. The Council confirmed that Stage Three of EMU is to start on 1st January 1999. The decision on which countries will participate in the euro area is to be made as early as possible in 1998 (probably February--April) on the basis of which countries fulfil the convergence criteria in respect of statistics for 1997. Euro banknotes and coins are to be in circulation by January 2002 at the latest. BIS Review 14/1997 - 3 - The preparatory work last year was dominated by two issues: one was what is now called the growth and stability pact and the other was the nature of the relationship between the euro and the currencies outside the euro area. A common factor in these matters is the question of maintaining stability once EMU has been established. 1. Growth and stability pact Without specific restrictions  participation in the euro area would make it easier for a country to implement an expansionary budget policy. When national currencies disappear and the interest rate largely reflects the single monetary policy  some of the immediate signals to politicians and other decision-makers will disappear. Access to the large  uniform capital market that will result from EMU will also make it easier to borrow. Up to a point  of course  this is good; it eases the tax burden in countries with a large government debt  for example. But it also involves risks  above all that a country abuses the situation so that ultimately it is other countries which may have to pay when failure threatens. The Maastricht Treaty  as most people probably know by now  contains a number of conditions that member states have to fulfil in order to participate in the euro area. Once countries have joined the euro area  however  there are no correspondingly strict rules. This is where the growth and stability pact comes in. The purpose of the pact is to get participating countries to strive for a cyclically balanced budget or a surplus position. Deviations from this target are to trigger alarm signals whereby the Council starts to take action in the form of examinations  advice  recommendations  publication and  ultimately  sanctions. The monitoring of economic development in member states is to be reinforced with a mandatory stability programme  similar to the present convergence programme. In the event of a country having an excessively large budget deficit  its government must act. If adequate measures have not been taken within ten months  the country will be required to deposit a no-interest fee with the EU Commission. If the deficit is still excessive after two years  the fee is transformed into a fine. At most the fine can amount to the equivalent of 0.5 per cent of GDP. If the deficit is due to exceptional circumstances  sanctions are not to be imposed. If GDP falls by 2 per cent  no sanctions are to be levied for an excessively large budget deficit. The Council can also decide not to impose sanctions if GDP falls by between 0.75 and 2 per cent and other “special circumstances” apply. While the point of a system for preventing the abuse of fiscal policy in EMU has always been clear  one cannot turn a blind eye to the risks inherent in rules such as those in the stability pact. It is thus a matter of striking a reasonable balance between different interests  which is why the discussion has been so protracted. The risks are mainly of two kinds: - One has to do with the need of adjustment mechanisms. With no possibility of using monetary and exchange rate policy at the national level  it may be important for the system to provide other “buffers”. Therefore the pact ought not to be so strict that it might in practice have a destabilising effect in a particular country with problems. - The other concerns credibility. What would happen if the threat of sanctions fails to act as a deterrent? Will the European political system be capable of punishing a member state? BIS Review 14/1997 - 4 - The main features of the growth and stability pact have been established. It remains to draw up specific rules about  for example  the monitoring of exchange rate stability  the construction of the stability programme and the legal framework. Finally it may be worth mentioning that the monitoring routine and the excessive deficit procedure will be essentially the same for countries outside the euro area  except in one respect - the sanctions. 2. ERM 2 The Dublin meeting also decided that a new exchange rate arrangement  ERM 2  is to be set up as the dominant mechanism for the coordination of monetary policy and other economic policies between the member states in the euro area and those that remain outside. The system will resemble the existing ERM except that this is a multilateral system of rates for conversion between all the member currencies  while in ERM 2 the currencies of non- participating countries will be linked directly to the euro. The risk of systemic tensions with ERM 2 will probably be smaller than it has been earlier with ERM because the degree of convergence in the EU area is now greater. Moreover  the band on either side of the central rates will probably be relatively broad. The experience gained in 1992-93 has also resulted in a greater readiness to adjust rates when this is considered necessary. But of course speculative situations cannot be ruled out either in the present ERM or in ERM 2  as is clear from developments in Finland in recent months. The Swedish position has been to avoid making the new exchange rate arrangement mandatory. Basically  we consider it would be better to achieve coordination in Europe with a single inflation target. We find the present construction of Swedish monetary policy satisfactory. But we can get along with the system that has been chosen. Cooperation will not be mandatory  which means that monetary policy can be conducted with an inflation target as well as with a fixed exchange rate with the euro. Still it is clear that there will be strong pressure on us to participate in ERM 2. It is also conceivable that a period of participation in the exchange rate mechanism will prove to be a condition for EMU membership. In any event  as a EU member state we have undertaken to conduct exchange rate policy as “a matter of common interest”. Changeover plan for the financial sector It is the Riksdag (Sweden’s parliament) that decides if Sweden should join EMU. The Riksbank has the task of helping to ensure that Sweden does in fact have a choice when the time comes to decide  so that Sweden is ready to join if a Riksdag majority so requires. The Ministry of Finance and the Riksbank each have an organisation for the euro’s practical introduction. The scale of the systemic changeover is tremendous  roughly on a par with our earlier change to driving on the right-hand side of the road. A fundamental principle for the work is that  as far as possible  all those concerned are to find their own solutions to the problems posed by EMU. The Riksbank is responsible for the changeover in the financial sector. To this end we have set up a body called SIFS (the Swedish acronym for Consultation and Information to the Financial Sector). One result to date is a report  published a few days ago  on the situation as regards the euro in Sweden’s financial sector. Good progress has been made in the preparatory work. Timetables and suitable solutions have been established in a number of fields. The Riksbank considers that the financial BIS Review 14/1997 - 5 - sector can manage a changeover to the euro on 1st January 1999. Participation from a later date can facilitate the preparatory work in certain respects and complicate it in others. The worst alternative is a long period of uncertainty; that would entail a costly duplication of systems in many fields. I should like to end with some examples of changes that will occur and be of importance for the financial markets. 1. Monetary policy A single currency presupposes a single monetary policy. In EMU this will be implemented by the ECB. In this context the national central banks will function as “operative arms”  acting on instructions from the ECB. For Swedish banks and financial institutions  the difference as regards participation in central bank monetary policy operations will probably not be all that great. The Riksbank will no doubt continue to be the financial sector’s counterparty. The main differences from today for Swedish banks are that the overnight market will be considerably larger and that minimum reserves are likely to be required. How monetary policy is to be constructed and implemented in detail has still to be decided. These matters will not be finalised until the ECB has been established next year. Thus it is the countries which participate from the start that will be in a position to influence the conduct of policy as well as the organisation of the work in the new European bank. There are already tendencies for countries belonging to the “presumed” core to exercise a greater influence over the process. 2. Payment system A single monetary policy calls in turn for a common payment system in order to handle the payments connected with the policy’s implementation. The arrangements whereby all the national systems are interlinked is called the Target system. In the new system  a cross-border payment will normally be made in a matter of seconds  whereas at present in the best case it takes a whole day. The main objective of Target is to enable the ECB to implement monetary policy but the new system will also provide a new “highway” for commercial transactions. The extent to which banks and other enterprises use the system will probably depend on the price. All the national central banks in the EU area can join Target  whether or not their country is in the euro area. But there is a considerable risk of countries outside the euro area being in a worse position  for instance due to restrictions on intra-day borrowing in euro to counter fluctuations in the payment flows. We have vigorously opposed this threat of discrimination but the issue  along with others  has been deferred and will now be decided by the countries that join the euro area from the start. 3. Legal framework A clear legal framework for the euro is essential. Economic values  for instance in contracts  bank accounts and pension agreements  must be guaranteed during the changeover period from 1999 to 2002  when the euro and national currencies will exist side by side. The so- BIS Review 14/1997 - 6 - called continuity of contracts is regulated in one of the euro statutes but amendments to national laws will also be needed. Another legal issue concerns the national central banks. As regards the Riksbank  the Maastricht Treaty calls for a more independent statutory status. This means  for instance  that the status of the Governor must be clarified; grounds for his or her dismissal will have to be explicit  e.g. serious misconduct  etc. Neither will the Riksbank be able to accept directives  except of a statutory nature  from others  e.g. the Government. The composition of the Governing Board may be a problem; the appointment of members of Parliament to the Governing Board runs counter to traditions in Central Europe. 4. Debt conversion and issues The countries that join the euro area may - and it is also envisaged that they will - issue treasury paper denominated in euro. A member state wishing to convert its stock of debt into euro will be allowed to initiate the appropriate measures. A member state may also take steps whereby private issuers and marketplaces (e.g. the Stockholm Stock Exchange  OM and the Securities Register Centre) can switch to euro in the changeover period. Many institutions and agents are in fact planning to do this. All private economic agents are to be free to choose between using euro from the start of Stage Three and waiting until the changeover has been completed. However  the agents in the Swedish securities market  banks  financial institutions  the Securities Register Centre  the Stockholm Stock Exchange  OM and others are unanimously in favour of a “big-bang” solution  that is  a quick  concerted changeover from kronor to euro right from the turn of 1998. 5. Banknotes and coins Euro banknotes and coins will not be introduced until the beginning of 2002. For a time  commerce will have to cope with two sets of prices  one in krona and the other in euro. A timetable for the substitution of banknotes and coins is to be fixed by each country. For Sweden the Riksbank hopes that the changeover can be arranged in an appreciably shorter time than the allotted six months. It should be underscored  finally  that EMU is likely to bring about notable changes in the financial landscape. Some products will simply disappear: currencies  as well as forward and option instruments derived from them. With a single monetary policy and no exchange risk  interest rate differentials between national treasury papers will arise only from credit risk. The market for Swedish treasury paper will be more or less integrated in a market for treasury paper in euro. Provided the debt situation in the countries concerned is under control and reasonably similar  national T-bonds will become close substitutes. That will also do away with a number of national forward and option products. Certainly there will be new financial products; there has been no lack of creativity in this field in the past decade. There will clearly be increased competition between financial institutions as well as between financial markets in different locations. There is nothing new about the globalisation and integration of the world’s financial markets but it is reasonable to suppose that EMU will accelerate the process. BIS Review 14/1997 Summary and conclusions - 7 - Today it looks for the most part as though economic and monetary union will start as planned on 1st January 1999. For Sweden the question is whether we are to participate from the start  wait a while or try to remain outside for ever. Recently the discussion of this issue has finally got going. My view has been that it is not just a question of economics  though the economic arguments do point to participation. EMU is one important component of the EU cooperation in which Sweden is now taking part. From the debate about economic aspects of EMU one sometimes gets the impression that an alternative exists which is much simpler  enabling us to avoid all the adjustments which Brussels imposes. That is not the case. Sweden has experienced a profound economic crisis in the 1990s that was essentially self-inflicted. Development in the rest of Europe has on the whole been better. We must now in any event continue to consolidate government finance and establish long-term confidence in the stability of Swedish economy. This will scarcely be easier outside EMU. I find it hard to envisage that Sweden would ultimately want to remain outside a functional EMU. Bit by bit the countries of Europe will grow together. This makes the question not whether but when Sweden ought to join. Perhaps this perspective can help to make the question less dramatic. In our efforts to prepare the financial sector for EMU we can see that the work has come a long way. We also meet a strong desire from the parties concerned to get going as quickly as possible so as not to fall behind; so as to compete on the same terms as other European enterprises and not lose business opportunities. My own experience of EU cooperation prompts the same conclusion. As a “free rider” alongside EMU it is not just business opportunities that we lose but also influence on European cooperation.

George  at the IMF 7th Central Banking Seminar entitled Banking Soundness and Monetary Policy in a World of Capital Markets and held in Washington on 29/1/97. Mr. Chairman  I am delighted to take part in this well-directed and well-timed seminar. I am particularly pleased to be able to share with you my thoughts on the question you put to me “Are banks still special?” That question is partly a matter of institutional fact; but beyond that lies the question of whether the institutional characteristics of banks still justify central banks’ special concern for the stability of the banking system reflected in both macro- and micro-prudential oversight and in their role as lender of last resort. So the answers to those questions could have far-reaching implications for the role of central banks themselves. In offering my answers I will ask  first  why banks have been regarded as special? Then I will ask whether banks have changed  or whether other financial institutions have become more bank-like? I will save my conclusions until the end! I am conscious  in this international forum  that I speak from a British perspective - in terms of the institutional and legal contexts and their evolution in relation to banks. But I would hope that  while some of the detail may be specific to the UK  the broad substance will not be. In what ways have banks been regarded as special? Let me begin then by discussing why  and in what senses  banks have been regarded as special. The term bank  historically and more than ever today  covers a multitude of sins. In practice it refers to a range of very different institutions which may  and do  within legal restraints  engage in a variety of different financial - and even some non-financial - activities whether on their own account or in an agency or advisory capacity. But banks have some key distinguishing characteristics in common. In particular they take unsecured deposits from the public at large. The particular characteristics of bank deposits are that they are capital certain and (more or less) immediately accessible to the depositor  so that they came to be used as the principal means of making payments. In short  because of their convenience  bank deposits became the predominant repository for the immediately liquid asset holdings of the rest of the economy  and the predominant form of money. The attraction of these deposit and payments services depends upon depositors generally having a high degree of confidence that their funds will in fact be available on demand and it depends upon the cost of the services. In providing the services  therefore  the banks need to strike a balance between deploying their deposits in low-yielding  high quality  liquid assets to meet cash withdrawals  and riskier investments to generate a higher return. In this latter context banks have traditionally played a key role in financing the corporate and household sectors  earning their return by gathering information about  and assessing and monitoring  the creditworthiness of private sector borrowers  especially those who do not or cannot cost-effectively provide the comprehensive  public  information that would allow them to access the capital markets. Much of the banks’ lending  while nominally at short-term  for example in the form of callable overdrafts  is in practice illiquid and non-marketable. So a further BIS Review 13/1997 - 2 - distinctive characteristic of banks is that they typically function with a mismatch between their highly liquid liabilities and their less liquid  non-marketable  assets. There is no need  I think  to labour the importance to the economy as a whole of these distinctive banking functions  or the damage that would be caused if the banks’ role - as the repository of liquidity  as the core payments mechanism  and as the principal source of finance to at least a large part of the economy - were seriously interrupted. That in itself helps to explain the public interest in the effective functioning of the banking system  or why banks collectively have been regarded as special. But beyond that  the distinctive banking characteristics that I have described  of liquid liabilities and less liquid assets  give rise to special needs. Given the banks’ role in the payments system they may need late access to liquidity to square their positions vis-à-vis each other after executing payments instructions on behalf of their customers. This explains why  in their routine monetary operations to relieve shortages in the money-market  central banks in many countries tend to confine their (late) lending to banks even when they accept a wider range of counterparties in providing liquidity through open market operations. The same distinctive characteristics make banks especially dependent upon public confidence. Bank depositors are not generally in a position to monitor or assess the financial condition of their bank  so that any suggestion that a particular bank may not be in a position to meet its liabilities is likely to lead to the panic withdrawal of its deposits. This can precipitate the suspension of payments as a result of lack of liquidity even when a bank is solvent as a going concern; and the forced realisation of illiquid assets may in itself result in insolvency. Moreover  any suggestion that one bank is in trouble may be taken - perhaps wholly unjustifiably - as evidence that other banks are likely to be facing similar problems  especially when they are engaged in similar activities. Bank runs can for this reason become contagious. And the risk of contagion is increased by inter-bank exposures  including those arising from the banks’ role in the payments system. So the special nature of banks has reflected not just their distinctive functions  and the importance of those functions to the wider economy  but also their peculiar vulnerability to liquidity pressures. Central banks evolved in response to this vulnerability  which gave rise to a readiness to act as lender of last resort to the banking system in situations in which substantial systemic disturbance could otherwise occur and to an on-going concern for the macro-prudential characteristics of the banking system. And while this concern relates to the banking system as a whole  last resort assistance  when it is judged to be necessary  is extended to individual banks because problems of course arise in the first instance at the level of the individual bank. Now  the fact that central banks (in conjunction as necessary with governments) are prepared  in certain circumstances  to extend support in this way encourages bank intermediation; it represents in effect a form of subsidy  implicitly justified as being in the wider interest of the economy. It helps to preserve public confidence; and it enables the banks to take on more maturity transformation or risk than they could otherwise  so lowering the effective cost of their intermediation. But it has long been recognised that if central bank support is made available too liberally - in situations where there is no genuine systemic risk  so that it comes to be relied upon as a matter of course  then that would give rise to moral hazard. The extent of bank intermediation would be unjustifiably expanded. On the one hand  the banks themselves may be encouraged to take on excessive risks; while  on the other  depositors may be encouraged to ignore risk and to become literally care-less as to where they place their BIS Review 13/1997 - 3 - deposits. So  both the safety and soundness of the banking system  and its competitive efficiency  and that of the financial system more generally  may be undermined. Central banks’ macro-prudential concerns for the stability of the banking system have necessarily meant that they have taken a close interest in the risk characteristics of individual banks as the component parts of the system. But more recently (at least in the UK - with the coming into force of the first Banking Act in 1979) individual banks were brought under formal banking supervision for the first time  and non-bank depositors provided with limited deposit insurance. Such micro-prudential supervision of each individual bank  of course  also helps to reduce the risk of instability in the system as a whole  and even limited deposit protection may reduce the risk of bank runs  at least in the form of the sudden withdrawal of retail deposits. This  too  of course  can give rise to moral hazard problems if it is perceived as tantamount to a guarantee. But micro-prudential supervision and deposit insurance were introduced in the UK at least (though not in the US) with the distinct  social  purpose of providing individual  small  depositors with a degree of protection against the sudden loss of their principal liquid asset holdings. This made banks  and bank deposits  special in a different sense insofar as similar formal supervision and asset protection were not (at that time) extended to other financial intermediaries or their liabilities. These then are the respects in which banks have hitherto been regarded as special. Let me now move on to consider whether  or to what extent  the banks have kept their distinctive characteristics  or institutions have developed similar characteristics so that banks are no longer special in that sense. to what extent other financial To what extent have banks changed? It is certainly true  as I noted earlier  that banks engage in a range of financial activities besides those which I have described as distinctively banking activities. Major banks everywhere have increasingly diversified the products and services they offer  built up investment banking businesses and trading activities  extended into life insurance  and so on  sometimes on a single balance sheet or sometimes in separate non-banking entities. In the present context  however  the question is whether these developments have fundamentally altered the characteristics of the banking part of their balance sheets. It seems to me that the answer  generally speaking  is that they have not. On the liabilities side  while there may have been (indeed in some countries  where close substitutes for money  such as money-market mutual funds have taken off  there certainly has been) some erosion of the banks’ market share as a repository for liquid asset holdings  that erosion has generally been very gradual. In the UK  for example  bank (and building society) deposits still account for 42% of personal sector liquid asset holdings against 50% a decade ago; the proportion would be very much higher if liquid assets included only those that are capital certain. And the vast bulk of the banks’ liabilities remain in the form of unsecured  short-term  deposits. Despite the rapid development of (secured) repo markets  only some 3% of the major UK banks’ funding (in sterling and foreign currency together) was secured (from information provided last Autumn) through repo; and the figure for all UK banks  including the business conducted in branches and subsidiaries of overseas banks  which have less direct access to deposits  was only around 8½%. The proportion of secured funding is below 5% for other major internationally active banks that we have looked at  with the exception of JP Morgan and Bankers Trust - both somewhat special cases - where the proportion is very BIS Review 13/1997 - 4 - much higher (25-35%). And even in those special cases it is still well below that for the major US securities firms (typically 55-80%). Banks remain  too  at the heart of payments systems. Payments may be made directly across bank accounts through instructions  for example  in the form of cheque or debit card; or they may be made indirectly  through  for example  the use of credit cards  the balances on which are subsequently settled using a bank account. Even where disintermediation creates new chequing facilities  as for example  in the case of money-market mutuals  these are still cleared through settlement banks. It is true that new forms of money transmission - e-money - are being developed  sometimes outside the conventional banking system. But I suspect that they  too  will typically depend upon clearing through the banking system. To the extent that they come to involve the creation of what are effectively direct deposits  they will represent banking in a different form and become special  and logically subject to regulation  in much the same way as conventional bank deposits. In the payments system context  too  important progress is being made to reduce inter-bank exposures (through the introduction of real time gross settlements systems in many countries  for example  and through the netting of foreign exchange settlements) but those exposures  as well as inter-bank exposures incurred in direct inter-bank transactions - the large bulk of all of which are unsecured - remain extraordinarily large. Individual inter-bank limits can substantially exceed 25% of capital (the normal supervisory limit for large exposures)  and as an example of aggregate inter-bank exposures the major UK retail banks currently place some £115 billion  or 16% of their total assets  with each other or with other UK banks. Turning to the assets side  there is some evidence of a gradual erosion of the role of banks in financial intermediation. One measure in the UK is a decline in the banks’ (and building societies’) share in the assets of the whole financial sector (including securities firms  collective investment vehicles  and life assurance and pension funds’ investments etc) which has fallen fairly steadily over the past 10 years  from close to 70% to some 55%. I believe that in the US  where financial innovation has probably been even greater  comparable figures also show this decline  from around 45% in the mid-1970s to about one third now. In the UK  bank lending to the corporate sector has fallen  erratically  from some 27% of total corporate borrowing outstanding (including all forms of debt as well as equity issuance) in 1985 to less than 17%. This mainly reflects the increased access of larger corporate borrowers to the domestic and international capital markets for short and longer-term corporate paper  where they often have a better credit rating than banks. Smaller corporates  on the other hand  remain very heavily dependent upon bank finance - for well over half their overall needs. Meanwhile the banks’ share of net external finance of the personal sector has not changed much at all over the past decade  at around 80%. Trends in the liquidity of bank assets are difficult to assess because liquidity itself is so hard to judge simply from balance sheet categories. The advent of securitisation and the direct sale of loans ought to have helped. But except in the US  securitisation has in fact so far made only limited progress  and debt sales have been focused mainly on impaired developing country or corporate debt. One reason why prime corporate loans are not so far traded is the importance that both banks and borrowers still attach to their mutual relationships. My guess is that the liquidity of bank assets by these means will gradually increase; and that process may be helped by the development of techniques such as credit derivatives. But for the time being - and indeed some time to come - bank loans are  for the most part  likely to remain illiquid in most countries. BIS Review 13/1997 - 5 - We can nevertheless look at the crude balance sheet data  and  for what they are worth  we have looked at the share of loans to non-banks in total assets as a measure of the liquidity of the asset portfolio for a range of different types of institution. These data show that: for some representative small  domestic  UK banks the loan ratio is still some 70-80% of the total  apparently with no particular trend; for large UK  internationally-active  banks the share of loans is currently around 50%  having fallen quite sharply from some 65-70% some five years ago  perhaps reflecting the expansion of their investment banking activity; for large continental banks the share of loans is either side of 50%  having fallen more gradually. Again JP Morgan and Bankers Trust are outliers. Their loan ratio to total assets is down to around 12% from around 50% in 1985 and 30% only 5 years ago. That is still much higher than the illiquid asset ratio for the large US securities firms which has fairly consistently been around 2%. The conclusion that I draw from all of this is that while there certainly have been important changes affecting the banks  and the environment in which they operate  they have not  yet at least  been such as to affect fundamentally their relevant key functions or the importance of those functions to the economy; nor have they altered fundamentally the distinctive characteristics of either the banks’ liabilities or their assets. To what extent have other financial institutions become more like banks? So  then  to what extent have other financial institutions developed similar characteristics to the distinctive characteristics of the banks as I have described them? The question  let me be quite clear  is not whether other financial institutions perform economically or socially important functions - clearly they do - and those functions may equally be special in their own distinctive ways. It is also obviously true that  with the upsurge in financial innovation and globalisation that we have seen in the past 10-20 years  there has been substantial blurring of the boundaries between different types of financial institution and the increasing emergence of multifunctional  multinational  financial groups  so that non-bank institutions have taken over banks or offered banking services just as banks have entered substantially into non-banking financial activities. But that is not the issue either. The question is whether the distinction between banking and non-banking financial functions has been eroded  again whether those functions are carried out in separate entities or on the same balance sheet. I do not think it has. Take  for example  long-term savings institutions - life insurance companies and pension funds. They clearly perform a vital economic and social function  and they are subject to separate functional regulation because of their special importance as homes for the long-term savings of the personal sector and as providers of long-term capital. But their liabilities are totally unlike the very liquid liabilities of banks  and the liquidity of their assets and liabilities are much more closely matched - indeed their marketable assets tend to be more liquid than their liabilities. The distinction remains even where these activities are carried out in a banking BIS Review 13/1997 - 6 - group  though in this case the different businesses have to be conducted on ring-fenced balance sheets and subject to different prudential tests  reflecting the quite different nature of the contracts and the different risks involved. That is not to deny that there may well be risks running from one part of the group to another - for example reputational risks or operational risks arising from shared systems or personnel and so on. It is not to deny either that there can be large cross-functional financial exposures. That  of course  is why the respective supervisors need to take an interest in all parts of a financial group and in intra-group exposures. But none of this  it seems to me  means that long-term savings institutions have taken on the distinctive special characteristics of banks. So far  I would hope  so good in the sense that perhaps most of you would agree that this particular distinction remains. But have I chosen this extreme example as an Aunt Sally? Well perhaps to a degree I have. So let me take some less obvious cases. What about money-market mutual funds  for example? Surely they at least have some of the characteristics of banks? They  too  act as a repository for liquidity and it is possible to make payments from some of them  which looks very like a banking arrangement? And so it does. But in fact I think this appearance is deceptive  for three reasons: - first  investments in money market mutuals are not  as I understand it  in principle capital certain (though in practice they may be supported by the fund’s sponsor); nor are they covered by deposit insurance (though this may not always be understood by the investor); - secondly  as I mentioned earlier  money-market mutuals are not themselves at the heart of the payments mechanism  but in effect piggy-back on the banks which are; - and  thirdly  money market mutuals do not undertake maturity transformation by making illiquid loans; like all collective investment schemes they put their investors’ funds into marketable instruments in accordance with the rules of the fund. Whereas money-market mutuals have something of the character of banks on the liabilities side of their balance sheets  but not on the assets side  the converse is true of non-bank finance companies. They do make illiquid loans  much as banks do. But they typically fund themselves in capital markets or from the banking system  and do not offer capital-certain  immediately available  liabilities to the public at large which are in any way comparable to bank deposits. Nor do they typically offer payments services. But what about the free-standing securities houses - and in particular those of American and Japanese parentage that have  up to now  been separated from commercial banking activity by the Glass-Steagall Act and by Article 65? They  surely  have both liquid liabilities and engage in maturity transformation; and  of course  they do actually operate partly through banking entities outside their home jurisdictions. Again  however  I think appearances may deceive. The liabilities of the houses are not in fact a bit like bank deposits. While it is true that the houses have increased the extent of their unsecured funding  for example through public issues  the bulk of their liquid liabilities are still secured - with  as I said  some 55-80% of the total funding of the US houses we have looked at typically in the form of repos. Nor do the houses hold themselves out to take deposits BIS Review 13/1997 - 7 - from the public at large. Nor  finally  are their liabilities directly usable as a payments medium. In all these respects the houses’ liabilities are non-monetary - even if they can rapidly be turned into money. On the assets side of the balance sheet  the securities houses continue to invest primarily in liquid  marketable assets which can readily be sold. This is partly a reflection of the nature of investment banking business  in particular trading  underwriting and so on  and of regulatory requirements  but also of funding uncertainty: the securities house protects itself by being able  if necessary  to contract the size of its balance sheet very rapidly. Illiquid assets continue to be a small proportion of the total  generally of the order of 2%  and the houses mitigate the maturity transformation risk in holding these  and marketable assets of more doubtful liquidity (such as some emerging market instruments)  by matching with long-term borrowings. What is certainly true is that the securities houses have expanded their activities enormously - with balance sheets extending to $100-200 billion  which puts them in this respect on a par with large international banks. And  given their focus on trading activity - in money  capital and foreign exchange markets - they are  of course  huge counterparties of the banks  with very large exposures both among themselves and between them and the banks  but with the important distinction that exposures between  or to  securities houses are more typically secured. Size in any event does not in itself mean that the securities houses now have the special  distinguishing  characteristics of banks - any more than the long-term savings institutions or the money funds or indeed large non-financial corporates  which may also have huge balance sheets and which may also have large Treasury operations in-house to manage the funds for own account. Systemic risk So it seems to me that banks are indeed still special insofar as they continue to perform distinctive economic functions and insofar as their liabilities and assets still have distinctive characteristics. This means that there is still a distinct public interest in the activities of institutions that are engaged in banking - as defined - whether as free-standing entities or within a broader group structure. That interest includes a micro-prudential concern to provide some measure at least of protection to public depositors  reflected in the supervision of individual banking institutions and in deposit protection schemes. But it includes also a macro-prudential concern with the stability of the banking system as a whole  because of its peculiar vulnerability to contagious - systemic - disturbance  reflected in central banks’ preparedness to provide liquidity to the system where that is judged to be necessary. Other forms of financial activity also perform distinctive functions  and have distinctive characteristics which make them special in their own different ways. And these special features equally may - and often do - give rise to special public interests. The public interest in these other financial activities may be driven by a social concern to protect consumers (for example the prospective beneficiaries of pension funds or life insurance policy holders  or investors  whether in collective funds or individually  through different kinds of intermediary  in capital markets)  which is similar to the social concern relating to depositor protection. And it may extend to other aspects of the particular activity  including aspects of business conduct as well as the financial integrity of the institutions involved. In fact the public interest in non-banking financial activity has certainly increased in this sense - both in terms of the range of BIS Review 13/1997 - 8 - activities covered and the standards of protection demanded - as is reflected in the spread of financial regulation over the past 10-20 years as the activities themselves have expanded. Our own Financial Services Act  for example  which provides for formal regulation of investment business dates only from 1986. A corollary of this broadening public interest is that multifunctional financial services providers are bound to be subject to a broadening range of functional regulation - however such regulation is structured. What I think is less clear is the extent and nature of the public macro-prudential interest in non-banking financial activities. I have argued that other  non-banking  financial activities are not - because of the different characteristics of the related liabilities and assets - subject to runs in the same way as banks  and that they are not therefore subject to contagious - systemic - disturbance in the same sense as banks. But that does not mean that non-bank financial institutions cannot face liquidity pressures. It does not mean either that the failure of a non-bank financial institution could not - through its direct credit or settlements exposures to other financial institutions (bank or non-bank) - have damaging knock-on effects. Conceivably  too  such a failure could have such serious consequences for the liquidity of - or price level in - some particular sector of the financial markets  that concerns would arise for the liquidity  or solvency  of other bank or non-bank institutions that were known  or believed  to be heavily exposed to that market. In this sense size does matter - and  whether or not one chooses to describe the risk of this happening as systemic  there is no doubt that a sufficiently large disturbance originating in the non-banking activity of one financial institution could put others in difficulty. This possibility must be of concern to financial regulators  including central banks  concerned with the stability of the financial system as a whole. It certainly in my view provides macro-prudential justification for regulatory oversight of the activity of (large) non-bank financial institutions  and of the non-banking activities of banks - quite apart from micro-prudential regulation in the interests of consumer protection. It provides justification  too  for some form of consolidated prudential oversight of multifunctional financial groups and for monitoring large exposures  both intra-group and to outside counterparties. Where a problem of this sort does arise  it may well justify technical central bank intervention to help contain it - for example by facilitating payments and settlements to minimise market disturbance. But  I would be very cautious about extending last resort liquidity provision to financial institutions not engaged in banking activity  and where the particular justification for it  based upon banks’ distinctive functions and the distinctive characteristics of banks’ balance sheets  did not clearly apply. While I do not think such intervention can  realistically  be excluded altogether  I am concerned that an unduly liberal interpretation of systemic risk would increase the scope for moral hazard and ultimately weaken the safety and soundness of the financial system as a whole. Conclusion Mr. Chairman  my answer to your question Are banks still special? is essentially that while in some respects they may be less special than they were  they remain special nonetheless. They remain special in terms of the particular functions they perform - as the repository of the economy’s immediately available liquidity  as the core payments mechanism  and as the principal source of non-market finance to a large part of the economy. And they remain special in terms of the particular characteristics of their balance sheets  which are necessary to perform those functions - including the mismatch between their assets and liabilities which makes banks peculiarly vulnerable to systemic risk in the traditional sense of that term. Perhaps the day will come - and I do not at all exclude the possibility that other financial activity will continue increasingly to be carried on alongside banking activity  even on the same balance sheet  indeed I expect that to happen. That  in my view  does not reduce the special public BIS Review 13/1997 - 9 - interest in banking activity; although it may well affect the appropriate substance of banking supervision; and it certainly extends to banks’ other  different  functional public interests  including different regulatory interests. On the other hand I am not persuaded that the special public interest in banking activity extends to non-banking financial institutions  though different functional public interests in many cases clearly do. What is absolutely clear  in a world of increasing financial integration  is that neither the financial regulators nor the central bankers among you can expect an easy life! BIS Review 13/1997

Kelley  Jr.  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the Seminar on Banking Soundness and Monetary Policy in a World of Global Capital Markets sponsored by the International Monetary Fund and held in Washington on 29/1/97. I would like to say first that it is a pleasure for me to be here today to participate in this conference and to have the opportunity to exchange views on the important issues addressed by this session in particular. I also want to thank Governor George for his fine survey on the question of whether banks remain special; his paper makes many good points and I agree with virtually all of what he has to say. As a consequence  my comments will be more in the nature of expanding upon his remarks  rather than in taking issue with any of his main points. As Governor George noted  the degree to which each of us regards banks as “special” is bound to be colored by the history and development of banking in our respective countries. Of course  the U.S. banking is quite unique in many respects. Relative to the U.K.  for example  we have many more depositories (on the order of 25 000 or so) and they operate with more regulatory restrictions on their activities than in the U.K. and many other countries. Also  our system of deposit insurance is more generous than in the U.K. Bearing these differences in mind  I will attempt to address aspects of our subject today that apply more or less generically in all countries  but I will draw on U.S. experiences for illustrations. To begin  let me say that I found the seemingly simple question “Are banks still special?” to be deceptively difficult. In reading Mr. George’s paper and organizing my own thoughts on the subject  I was compelled to answer for myself a series of even more basic questions such as: “How do we define a ‘bank’?”  “What do we mean by ‘special’?”  and “If banks are indeed special  what does this imply about the proper stance of government vis-à-vis the banking industry and other types of financial services providers?” For the purposes of this discussion  I will define a bank rather broadly as any financial intermediary that accepts deposits and extends loans to households or businesses. In the United States  this definition encompasses domestic commercial banks  branches of foreign banks operating in the United States  savings and loan associations  and credit unions. Defining what constitutes “specialness” is more difficult. In general terms  analogous to Governor George’s definition  I will define a “special” aspect of banking as one in which there is a clear and pronounced public interest exceeding that present in other types of business and commerce. As I will note more fully in the following  my definition of “special” does not necessarily imply that the special aspect of banking in question should be isolated or insulated from competition with other financial service providers. There are at least three general aspects of banks and banking that have been deemed special by many observers -- the liquidity transformation function of banks  the provision of basic financial services such as credit extension  deposits-taking  and payments processing  and the linkage between the banking system and the conduct of monetary policy. In the following  I will take up each of these “special” aspects of banking in turn. So  is the liquidity transformation function of banks still special? By the term “liquidity transformation function” of banks  I refer to the typical balance sheet structure of banks that often features a sizable volume of highly liquid liabilities -- those that can be withdrawn at par on demand such as balances in checking accounts -- in combination with a BIS Review 13/1997 - 2 - portfolio of generally longer-term assets that often are difficult to sell or borrow against on short notice. It is probably fair to say that there is considerable agreement among central bankers and other economic policymakers that this unique balance sheet structure creates an inherent potential instability in the banking system. Rumors concerning an individual bank’s financial condition -- even if ill-founded -- can spark a run by depositors and other creditors that may force the bank to unload assets at firesale prices and  in extreme situations  suspend payment on withdrawal requests. Especially if the distressed institution is large or prominent  the panic can spread to other banks  with potentially debilitating consequences for the economy as a whole. Most countries with private banking systems have experienced episodes of bank panics to some degree  and in the United States  such panics occurred with some frequency in the late nineteenth century and were a major factor exacerbating the Great Depression of the 1930s. While institutional regimes differ  most countries have established safeguards against banking panics that rest on three basic pillars -- some form of deposit insurance (explicit or implicit)  a program of banking supervision and regulation  and an institution that can act as lender of last resort. To come back to our basic question of whether the liquidity transformation function of banks and the associated instability remains “special ” I would say that there is simply no doubt about it. Wherever banking panics have occurred  their effects on economic performance have been crippling. Thus  developing institutions and mechanisms that can prevent or short-circuit bank panics remains an important and “special” goal for economic policymakers. Having said this  however  recent experiences in the United States and elsewhere have underscored the importance of going about this task in a way that does not overextend the banking “safety net.” In the United States  this lesson was painfully conveyed during the 1980s and early 1990s by the hundreds and hundreds of bank and thrift failures that occurred in these years. While this phenomenon was extraordinarily complex  many have argued that underpriced deposit insurance and relatively lax supervision contributed to the problem by distorting the incentives banks and thrifts faced in assessing the risks of their business decisions. In response  U.S. federal banking agencies have implemented changes that trim the banking safety net somewhat -- for example  by requiring prompt closure of troubled institutions  by applying stricter rules governing the payoffs of depositors and other creditors in bank failures  and by curtailing the practice of allowing regulatory “goodwill.” In addition  new bank capital regulations such as the Basle risk-based capital standards  which have been implemented in the G-10 and have served as a blueprint for capital regulation in many other countries  have helped to provide better incentives for banks in their business decisions. To summarize  I would argue that banks remain quite special in their susceptibility to runs and in the severe consequences that a large-scale banking panic would involve today. Balancing the need for a banking “safety net” to defuse potential bank runs with the need to create the right incentives for banks in assessing and assuming risk is one of the most difficult challenges we face as central bankers. A second way in which banks have been deemed to be “special” is in the provision of basic banking services such as credit extension  deposit-taking  and payments processing. There is little question that these functions are critically important throughout society. Consumers turn to banks for safe investments such as time and savings deposits  for transactions deposits  for processing payments  and for short- and long-term credit. Large and small businesses rely on banks for payment processing  short-term credit  and backup credit BIS Review 13/1997 - 3 - lines. And governments rely on the banking system to conduct payments  distribute currency  safeguard tax receipts  and to serve as a conduit for monetary policy. In short  the basic business functions of banks are at the heart of the financial system and the economy overall. By the definition I put forward earlier  I would have to say that these basic functions performed by banks are and will remain special. However  it is far from clear that these functions can only be performed by banks or that there is always a “special” public purpose in ensuring that banks’ role in performing such functions is protected. Indeed  as Governor George noted  nonbanks have made impressive inroads in markets that previously had been largely banks’ domain. For example  money market mutual funds and stock and bond mutual funds have lured billions of dollars that formerly had been placed in staid bank investments such as certificates of deposits. Most mutual funds now also offer some “banking” services such as checkwriting privileges. The advent of asset securitization has allowed nonbank mortgage companies to compete successfully with banks in the home mortgage market  and nonbanks have also been important players in the explosion of new financial instruments such as derivatives and structured notes. For the most part  this blurring of the traditional lines between banks and nonbanks seems to be a positive development. New competitive forces have been unleashed  financial innovation has accelerated  and businesses and households now enjoy a far greater range of choices on their menu of financial services than they did only a decade ago. Banks have responded vigorously -- and I would say successfully  given recent trends in profitability -- to the challenges posed by nonbank competitors. To be sure  such rapid changes have also posed new risks. It is critical in this environment that policymakers stay abreast of market developments to ensure that banks and nonbanks face the right incentives in assessing the risks of their business decisions  and likewise to ensure that consumers and investors have the best possible information available to them when choosing among financial services and products. Thus  while I agree that the basic functions of banks in making credit available  in providing safe investment choices (deposits) for households  and in processing payments are special  I see little to be gained by insisting that banks always be the only type of entity that can provide such services. The case of electronic money helps to illustrate the point I am trying to make. It remains to be seen how popular this form of payment will become in the United States  but the question of whether nonbank institutions should be allowed to issue electronic money is actively being debated in many countries. Some argue that issuing money is a special bank function and that electronic money should properly remain exclusively a bank product. For the time being  however  I along with other policymakers at the Federal Reserve have concluded that any decision to reserve the nascent market for smart cards and other forms of electronic money as a province for banks alone might well stifle both competition and technological innovation in this area. Thus  while most would agree that providing efficient payment media for small dollar transactions is a “special” function that banks currently perform  it does not follow that only banks should be allowed to perform the function. As a corollary  I would also say that there is not a “special” public purpose in constraining banks from competing in many other markets traditionally dominated by nonbank financial institutions. This is a subject which is especially topical in the United States because our domestic banks are more restricted in the business activities in which they can engage than are banks in many other countries. As you know  the Federal Reserve has pushed to expand banks’ ability to compete with investment houses in underwriting securities  and the scope for U.S. banks to sell insurance-related products has also expanded recently. BIS Review 13/1997 - 4 - The third general aspect of banking that is often deemed special is the linkage between the banking system and monetary policy. Of course  this is a topic that has spawned a truly vast economic literature. Without venturing into this thicket  I would simply like to note as fact that through much of the 1990-1994 period  growth of the broad U.S. monetary aggregates such as M2 was quite at odds with historical relationships to nominal income growth. Perhaps the most important factor underlying this development has been a fundamental realignment of household financial assets away from bank deposits in favor of bond and stock mutual funds and other capital market investments. This “decoupling” of banking system deposit liabilities and nominal GDP became so pronounced during the first half of the 1990s that the Federal Open Market Committee downgraded the status of M2 as a policy variable. Today M2 remains only one of the many variables reviewed by the FOMC in the course of its policy deliberations. I raise this example because financial innovations and shifts in financial structure affecting the monetary aggregates in other countries have similarly created complications in their implementation of monetary policy. Indeed  the difficulties in guiding monetary policy during periods of rapid financial innovation have been a factor contributing to greater experimentation among central banks with alternative targets such as inflation or nominal GDP growth. Thus  I believe one could argue that the growth of aggregate bank deposits or money is probably less “special” today as a policy variable in many countries than in the past. Ironically  while the growth of bank deposits may be less special as a policy guide  the special role of the banking sector as the primary vehicle in implementing monetary policy in most countries remains unchallenged. Most central banks seek to achieve their objectives through some form of interest rate management. Control over short-term interest rates is achieved in every case I am aware of by manipulating the supply of central bank reserves available to satisfy banks’ demand for reserves. Banks’ demand for reserves is similarly influenced by central banks either directly by setting reserve requirements or indirectly by allowing only banks to access the payment system and then setting the rules regarding the management of their central bank accounts. To conclude  I would like to return to one of the questions posed at the outset of these remarks: If banks are special  what does this imply about the proper stance of government vis-à-vis the banking industry? As I hope my previous comments make clear  regulatory and supervisory policies must recognize the dynamic forces at play in the financial sector. Such policies must promote and exploit the competitive process in order to foster efficient delivery of services while encouraging financial and economic stability. These objectives are not likely to be achieved by regulations that arbitrarily identify and rigidly segment bank and nonbank financial markets. Rather  our goal as policymakers should be to establish rules of the game that provide proper incentives for financial institutions to accurately assess and manage the risks inherent in their business decisions. Likewise  we should foster reporting standards and information flows so that the consumers of financial services and products are as well informed as possible about the risks and returns of the financial services and products they buy. To the maximum extent possible  market forces should determine which bundles of financial services and products are provided by banks and other types of financial service providers. As a final comment  I would note that sound macroeconomic policies are one of the most important ways to encourage the efficient delivery of financial services and the safety and soundness of financial institutions. Conversely  policies that result in significant macroeconomic implications for financial institutions and banks in particular. In reviewing the past two decades in the United States  for example  one cannot help but notice that the most severe problems in our banking and thrift imbalances frequently have serious adverse BIS Review 13/1997 - 5 - industries during the 1980s stemmed from serious macroeconomic imbalances -- including the accelerating inflation of the late 1970s and the costly but necessary steps to reverse that trend in the 1980s. By contrast  macroeconomic policies that encourage sustainable economic growth with low inflation -- like those in recent years -- have a strong positive influence on the overall health of the banking sector and other financial institutions as well.

Fazio examines the progress of the Italian economy in terms of stability and recovery Address by the Governor of the Bank of Italy  Dott. Antonio Fazio  at the Annual Meeting of AIOTE/ASSOBAT/ATIC/FOREX held in Milan on 25/1/97. Yesterday the effective exchange rate of the lira was 5 per cent higher than in December 1994. Compared with the low point reached in the March 1995 currency crisis  the lira has appreciated by 25 per cent. To find a period in which the lira recovered to such an extent and so fast  it is necessary to go back fifty years to 1947. Inflation  measured on the basis of the cost-of-living index  fell to less than 4 per cent on average in 1996; between June and December it was around 2 per cent on an annual basis. According to preliminary figures  inflation in January of this year was less than 2 per cent. The net external position of the Bank of Italy  excluding gold reserves  improved from $28 billion at 31 December 1993 to $45 billion at the end of last year. In 1994 purchases of foreign currency in the market  primarily in the first half of the year  amounted to $7 billion; in 1995 there were net sales totalling $7 billion. In 1996 purchases were renewed  at an accelerating pace from March onwards. Yesterday the foreign currency reserves of the Bank of Italy and the UIC amounted to $35 billion  after using $21 billion to repurchase official ecus and redeem foreign currency swaps and other short-term liabilities. Foreign exchange interventions have been carried out in such a way as to avoid interrupting the appreciation of the lira. Between 1 March and 22 November 1996 the effective exchange rate rose by 4.7 per cent; the lire needed to buy one German mark decreased from 1 056 to 998. The lira’s re-entry in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on 25 November 1996 was at the central rate of 990 against the mark and 1 906 against the ecu. The new rate corresponds to a depreciation of 19 per cent compared with that obtaining before the September 1992 currency crisis. The lira re-entered the ERM after the performance of the economy and an appropriate combination of policies had re-equilibrated Italy’s external position  brought a sharp slowdown in inflation and improved the outlook for the public finances. The surplus on the current account of Italy’s balance of payments and the return to external equilibrium provide a solid foundation for the maintenance of the internal and external stability of the lira. 1. The balance of payments The actions to reduce the budget deficit  the new level of the exchange rate  wage moderation and the stabilisation of prices have produced a shift in the composition of demand since 1993 that has permitted growing surpluses on the external current account after a long series of deficits. The surplus in 1996 is estimated to have been around 70 trillion lire  or 3.7 per cent of GDP. The surplus on goods and services was on the order of 90 trillion and in absolute terms was the largest recorded by the leading industrial countries. The increase of 18 trillion lire compared with 1995 was due to the improvement in the terms of trade  estimated at 4.7 percentage points. BIS Review 15/1997 - 2 - Exports of goods and services  after rising in volume by 10 per cent on average in each of the three previous years  remained basically unchanged. Sales of goods and services to the other EU countries diminished-as a result of the weakness of demand  whereas exports to the emerging countries continued to increase at a good pace. The share of Italian exports in world trade declined compared with the previous year  partly owing to a loss of competitiveness but mainly because of the unfavourable cyclical situation in Europe  where more than half of Italy’s exports are directed. Imports dropped by 2 per cent in volume  compared with increases of 9 per cent in both 1994 and 1995 and a decrease of 8 per cent in 1993; they were affected by the weakness of domestic demand for consumer and investment goods. The competitiveness of Italian products has diminished compared with 1995  but still shows a large improvement on the period before the September 1992 currency crisis. Measured in terms of producer prices  the real exchange rate of the lira shows a gain of competitiveness of 10 per cent compared with the first half of 1992. In terms of labour costs  the gain is on the order of 18 per cent (Figure 1). The marked appreciation of the lira in 1996 made a decisive contribution to the stabilisation of domestic costs and prices. The effect of the good trade performance on the exchange rate and market interest rates was reinforced by that of the surplus on capital movements. Portfolio investment abroad continued regularly  generating an outflow of 53 trillion lire; foreign investment in Italy increased substantially to 122 trillion (Table 1). 2. Italy’s external position. The exchange rate of the lira At the end of 1992 the country’s net liabilities amounted to 11 per cent of GDP; at the end of 1996 the ratio was well below 4 per cent (Figure 2). The current account surpluses that are forecast will bring the net external position roughly into balance by the end of this year and then make Italy a net creditor. Part of the item “errors and omissions” consists of capital outflows that are not recorded in the capital account; accordingly  the country’s external position is almost certainly already in balance. In September 1996 non-residents’ holdings of Italian government securities denominated in lire and foreign currency totalled 350 trillion lire  as against 290 trillion at the end of 1995 and 100 trillion in December 1992. This progression is evidence of foreign investors’ growing interest in the Italian securities market  but it is also the result of a policy aimed at diversifying the sources of Treasury finance. It exposes the domestic market  albeit deep and efficient  and government funding to interest rate movements in international markets and to the evaluations and decisions of international investors. The growing volume of public debt placed abroad is matched by the steady and substantial improvement in the external balance of the private sector. Starting from a net external debtor position of around 90 trillion lire at the end of 1992  by September of last year households and enterprises had built up a net creditor position of around 200 trillion (Table 2). The 1992 currency crisis caught Italian households and enterprises severely off balance; the latter  in particular  had built up substantial foreign currency liabilities  trusting in the stability of the exchange rate  even though this confidence was at odds with the expectations implicit in the significantly lower cost of borrowing in foreign currency compared with that in lire. BIS Review 15/1997 - 3 - The depreciation of the lira resulted in Italian firms incurring heavy losses. In the last few months of 1992 they began to reduce their foreign currency liabilities and build up their foreign currency assets and continued to do so on a major scale in the following years. The private sector’s gross external liabilities  about three quarters of which consisted of borrowings by non-financial enterprises  remained virtually unchanged at around 450 trillion lire; their composition changed  however  as the foreign currency share fell sharply. On the other hand  the external assets of enterprises  households and other non- bank operators rose from 370 trillion lire at the end of 1992 to 650 trillion in September 1996  with a significant increase in the proportion denominated in foreign currency. The recovery of the lira began in the spring of 1995  partly in response to domestic agents’ perception of the return to a balanced external position in foreign currency (Figure 3). Compared with a net external debtor position in foreign currency of 52 trillion lire in 1992  at the end of 1995 households and enterprises had already built up a net creditor position of 118 trillion. In September 1996 this had risen to 126 trillion (Table 3). In 1996 a major contribution to the improvement in the exchange rate came from the net sales of foreign currency against lire by non-residents for portfolio investment purposes. In the 1992 currency crisis the official reserves  acquired in connection with short-term capital inflows  proved evanescent in defending the exchange rate. The central bank’s foreign currency reserves are now part of an external position that is balanced overall and in surplus for the private sector. The domestic savings accumulated in Italy over the years is now again equal to  and in prospect will exceed  the sum of the country’s capital stock  created through public and private investment  and its huge public debt  contracted principally to finance the current spending of the public sector. 3. The global market The growing international integration of the Italian economy has profoundly affected the composition of financial assets and liabilities. The share of foreign assets  which accounted for 9.7 per cent of internal sectors’ total assets at the end of 1989  has risen in the nineties and was equal to 14 per cent at the end of the second quarter of 1996 (Table 4). The proportion in Italy is now similar to that in France; in Germany it is higher  at around 20 per cent. Neither in these two countries nor in the other leading industrial countries has it changed significantly in the nineties. The ratio of residents’ foreign financial assets to GDP is around 50 per cent in Italy  90 per cent in France and 80 per cent in Germany. The diversification of Italian saving through investment abroad will continue in line with the development of the financial system. The growth in Italy’s foreign assets in the last few years has been accompanied by a rapid increase in its foreign liabilities. The total financial assets of the leading industrial countries rose from 510 to 550 per cent of GDP between 1989 and 1994. Most saving and investment in these countries still has a domestic counterpart; the share of total financial assets with a foreign counterpart is around 10 per cent and equal to around 50 per cent of GDP (Table 5). BIS Review 15/1997 - 4 - The total of the six leading countries’ holdings of foreign bonds and shares is equal to some $4 trillion  or roughly one quarter of their GDP. International financial integration has led  especially in the nineties  to the emergence of a single  world market for currencies and securities linking all the leading national markets. In this global market the pricing and trading of financial instruments are affected by the underlying performance of the international economy as a whole. The pattern appears to depend above all on the tendency prevailing among instruments denominated in dollars. The influence exerted by US financial markets  and to an even greater extent by dollar-denominated instruments  predominates in the world economy. The financial assets and liabilities of the United States  including those with both domestic and foreign counterparts  account for nearly 40 per cent of the corresponding totals for the six leading industrial countries. Japan’s share is only slightly smaller  while Germany accounts for around 8 per cent of the total and Italy 4 per cent (Table 6). The close links with the dollar of the currencies of Latin America and many of the emerging South-East Asian countries increase the importance of the US currency in determining the international financial cycle. The correlation between the yields on medium and long-term securities across national markets appears to be close. Differentials tend to be larger during currency crises; when conditions are calmer and inflation rates converge  yields become more closely correlated and differentials smaller. The yields on short-term assets are controlled by national monetary policies. In recent years there has been a notable reduction in the power of central banks to control long- term yields directly. Superimposed on the underlying pattern of long-term rates in international markets there is a set of differentials that reflect the inflation expectations present in each country and the related medium-term expectations concerning the exchange rate. The response of long-term yields to a change in official rates depends on the conditions in the economy  the economic policies in force and  in particular  on the stance and firmness of monetary policy. The experience of the last few years in financially open economies with exchange rate flexibility between the major areas confirms the effectiveness of monetary policy in controlling inflation. This  in turn  exerts an influence on expectations and yield differentials  and thereby on the level of long-term interest rates. The mechanism is well known in monetary theory. To the extent that monetary control is effective  it is able to influence inflation expectations and thereby interest rate differentials and hence the nominal yields on long-term securities. At the beginning of 1995 we announced our intention of raising short-term rates with the aim of curbing  reversing  the increase in the very high yields on long-term securities (Figure 4). In the currency crisis of spring 1995 the yield differential between long-term Italian and German securities widened to 660 basis points. The budget adjustment measures adopted  the performance of the external accounts and the improvement in inflation expectations caused the gap to narrow over the rest of the year (Figure 5). BIS Review 15/1997 - 5 - In January of last year the yield differential with respect to Germany was still around 450 basis points; the more stable political climate and the further improvement in inflation expectations resulted in its narrowing to around 300 basis points at the end of May. The substantial budget adjustment announced in the autumn of last year  the approval of the Finance Law for 1997 and the further slowdown in inflation have reduced the differential to around 150 basis points. As things stand today a reduction in official rates by a country’s central bank is effective if it is ratification of more favourable inflation expectations. These  in turn  must be rooted in the performance of the public finances and costs. History shows many cases where the inconsistency of other policies with the objectives has resulted in longer-term rates rising instead of falling in the wake of an easing of monetary policy. 4. Market participants and the allocation of funds in the international market The growing openness of national financial systems has accelerated the development of the market for Eurocurrencies  especially that for cross-border deposits and loans. Institutional investors  banks and the other participants in the global market need liquid funds to carry out their financial transactions. Dollar deposits outside the United States are equal to 70 per cent of the US money stock. The ratio for the mark is slightly lower at 63 per cent; for the pound sterling and the French franc it is 13 and 16 per cent respectively. Following the complete liberalisation of Italian short-term capital movements  in the spring of 1990 the Eurolira market also began to expand rapidly. It is now larger than the corresponding markets for the Swiss franc  the French franc and the pound sterling (Table 7). At the end of the second quarter of 1996 the stock of Eurolire amounted to 340 trillion lire  or 30 per cent of the Italian money stock. London accounts for a major part of this market. The mass of lire traded in the international financial market reflects a demand for financial transactions that focuses mainly on the secondary market for Italian government securities  though the demand for Eurolira bonds and derivatives is growing. The rapid expansion of this market and the size it has grown to  despite the reduction in yield differentials  are evidence of market participants’ increased confidence in the lira. The last few years have seen the activity of institutional investors in the global market grow at a rapid pace. At the end of 1995 such intermediaries in the United States  Europe  Asia and Oceania with balance sheets of at least $10 billion had total assets of $21 trillion (Figure 6). These intermediated funds are equal to about one fifth of the estimated value of the six leading industrial countries’ total financial assets with domestic and foreign counterparts  and equal to three times the GDP of the United States and twenty times that of Italy. Institutional investors place the bulk of the funds they raise in their national markets; they are nonetheless of considerable importance in the international allocation of funds in view of how they make their investment choices and the scale of their investments. In Italy  as in other leading countries  a large part of the funds invested abroad by enterprises and especially households is channelled through such intermediaries. They reallocate their resources according to the importance of the various economies  taking account of exchange rate expectations  yields and risks. BIS Review 15/1997 - 6 - The proportion invested in each country is determined on the basis of portfolio optimisation criteria; the amounts involved are large enough to affect securities prices even in medium-sized financial markets At the end of 1995 European institutional investors had raised $7.5 trillion. They are estimated to have invested 78 per cent of their resources  or $6 trillion  in shares and bonds. Around $2 trillion  or roughly a quarter of the total volume of intermediated funds  was invested outside the intermediary’s home country (Figure 7). The funds raised by US institutional investors amounted to $8 trillion at the same date and they had invested 80 per cent of the total in shares and bonds  a figure close to that for European institutional investors. In view of the depth and diversification of the US market  the greater part of these intermediaries’ resources was invested in domestic securities; nonetheless  11 per cent  or around $900 billion  was invested in shares and bonds in foreign markets. Although institutional investors in Asia and Oceania had also invested domestically most of the nearly $5 trillion of funds they had raised at the end of 1995  their international investments in shares and bonds are nonetheless estimated to have amounted to $400 billion. Taken together  these institutional investors held more than $15 trillion of domestic and foreign shares and bonds at the end of 1995  corresponding to around 35 per cent of the stocks of such instruments issued by the leading industrial countries. These intermediaries’ investments in shares and bonds issued outside their home countries exceeded $3 trillion. The configuration of exchange rates and interest rates generated in international markets interacts with the financial variables of national markets In addition to the fundamentals of each economy  an important role is played by all the information permitting the assessment of the authorities’ ability to implement policies aimed at achieving growth in conditions of stability. 5. The 1995 currency crisis and the control of inflation In the early months of 1995 the Mexican crisis and the weakening of the US dollar prompted substantial and sudden shifts of funds  out of the weaker currencies into those considered to be stronger. In addition to the US dollar  the Canadian dollar  the pound sterling  the Swedish krona and the Spanish peseta also weakened considerably. The lira was hit hard: between mid-February and mid-March it depreciated by 15 per cent. The identification of a currency as weak or strong is linked to the general conditions in the economy  notably as regards the state of the public finances  the external position and the solidity of the country’s institutions. In the background there are the stability of the currency’s purchasing power  competitiveness  the outlook for economic growth and the availability of saving and the uses to which it is put. In Italy wage moderation made it possible to avoid a cost-price spiral  but the increase in consumer prices and the depreciation of the lira caused a marked deterioration in expectations. Opinion surveys revealed that a surge in inflation was expected (Figure 8a). At the same time as supplementary budget measures were adopted in February 1995  we raised the official discount rate and the rate on fixed-term advances; in May we raised them again. Monetary growth was drastically curbed. BIS Review 15/1997 - 7 - At the General Meeting of the Bank’s shareholders on 31 May 1995 we announced the objective of slowing inflation in the second half of the year; we pointed out that it was both possible and essential to reduce inflation to less than 4 per cent on average in 1996. Towards the middle of the year inflation expectations began to improve significantly (Figure 8a). Market yields on government securities started to come down  especially for longer maturities; the lira strengthened  partly owing to the appreciation of the dollar. On 31 May 1996  in addition to confirming that the conditions existed for inflation to fall below 4 per cent in 1996  we stated that it would be possible to achieve a more ambitious target in 1997: an inflation rate of less than 3 per cent. Between May and December of last year the average monthly rate of inflation on an annual basis was close to 2 per cent. The survey of consumer price expectations carried out last September indicated a rate of inflation of between 3 and 3.5 per cent in the first quarter of 1997. The survey carried out in December indicated a rate of between 2.5 and 3 per cent for the first half of this year (Figure 8a). 6. The outlook After the breakdown of the gold exchange standard all countries’ currencies became of a purely fiat nature. This is a new epoch in monetary history. International capital movements tend to expand  with a multiplication of money and credit at the global level that makes it increasingly difficult for authorities to exercise quantitative control. The volume of funds traded  the rapidity with which they can be shifted and the sensitiveness of market participants to economic and metaeconomic information can generate tensions in financial markets and influence the quotations of currencies and securities  with significant effects on economic activity and prices  even in medium-sized economies. Greater monetary stability in Europe not only benefits individual economies but also contributes to the solidity of the international financial system. The weakness of the economic cycle and the curbing of inflation have led to a fall in interest rates. Easier monetary conditions have been a major factor underlying the rise in bond and share prices. Monetary stability  public finances in order and flexible productive structures and factor markets are necessary to protect individual economies from destabilising speculative movements  to enable them to share in the benefits of the global market and economic and financial integration in Europe. This is the context in which policies must be implemented to permit the full employment of all the available resources of labour  saving and physical capital. In the last four years Italy has made significant progress in re equilibrating its external position  curbing the budget deficit and controlling inflation. In 1996 the slowdown in inflation permitted a substantial fall in interest rates; the Treasury’s spending on this item declined in absolute terms  despite the increase of 6 per cent in the stock of debt. The improvement in the budget deficit suffered a setback  however. The overall borrowing requirement grew in absolute terms and remained unchanged in relation to GDP at 7.4 per cent. The supplementary budget measures adopted in the middle of the year BIS Review 15/1997 - 8 - failed to prevent a large overshoot on the order of 30 trillion lire compared with the original target set in September 1995. In the Forecasting and Planning Report published last September the Government increased the 1997 budget adjustment to 62.5 trillion lire  compared with 37.5 trillion envisaged in the Economic and Financial Planning Document. This is a demanding commitment that is already having beneficial effects on government securities prices and the financial markets. As I pointed out in my Parliamentary hearing on the Finance Law  the forecasts of the borrowing requirement in 1997 reflect highly favourable assessments concerning the primary surplus; these are only compensated for in part by the significantly better-than-forecast behaviour of interest rates. The lower level of the primary surplus in 1996  with a shortfall of around 20 trillion lire compared with last September’s estimates  will have repercussions on the results in 1997; these will also be affected by the cyclical slowdown that started at the beginning of 1996 and became more pronounced in the last part of the year. The adjustment of the budget deficit will have to be pursued by curbing the growth in expenditure. On the revenue side it will be necessary to reduce tax avoidance and evasion. Further fiscal tightening would have adverse effects on domestic demand and prices. In order to create confidence in a return to equilibrium in the medium term  budget adjustment measures will have to be of a structural nature. There is an urgent need to revive growth. Italy  like many other leading European countries  is far from making full use of its resources of saving  labour and entrepreneurial ability  with consequent economic and social costs. In cyclical terms the level of economic activity remains unsatisfactory. According to the latest forecasts  the growth in GDP in 1997 will be just over 1 per cent. The trade surplus will remain large  as will the surplus on the current account of the balance of payments  thereby contributing to a further improvement in the country’s external position and providing support for the lira. It will be necessary to modify the composition of public expenditure  by reducing that on current account  in order to release the resources needed to return public investment to a normal level. In the last few years this component has fallen by around one percentage point of GDP. Investment will need to be directed to the areas and sectors where the shortfall in public infrastructure is greatest  to the benefit of productivity and  above all  of employment. The latest reduction in official rates  following that enacted in 1996  was made possible by the improvement in both actual and expected inflation. Together with the ample availability of saving  it also creates the conditions for a higher level of private investment. The fall in market interest rates will be locked in only if permanent price stability is achieved. Monetary stability  consolidation of the public finances and economic growth are three closely interrelated objectives. The experience of recent years shows that failing to achieve even one of them necessarily jeopardises the other two. The establishment and maintenance of the virtuous circle is likely to be interrupted by the reappearance of inflationary pressures  which can be engendered by labour BIS Review 15/1997 - 9 - costs  pricing policies that are short-sighted and unresponsive to competitive stimuli  by an insufficient reduction or excessive expansion of the budget deficit. Monetary policy will remain firmly directed towards producing an expansion of money and credit that will permit balanced growth of the economy in conditions of broadly stable prices. The rise in the incomes of those already working must not hinder the creation of employment. A smaller absorption of saving by the public sector will make resources available for investment. These are the conditions for removing the most acute  most socially unacceptable  forms of unemployment  which have been aggravated by the events of the last few years. They will allow a host of young people with qualifications and a desire to contribute to the development of our economy and society to become active members of the labour force.

Madam Chairwoman  members of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit  it is a pleasure to appear here today to present the views of the Federal Reserve Board on some broad issues associated with financial modernization. The unremitting pressures of technology and the market are drastically changing the financial landscape and eroding traditional positions of competitors  inducing new competitive strategies and participants  forcing new regulatory responses  and building pressures on the Congress to shape developments in the public interest. Madam Chairwoman  I know that you have been an active sponsor and supporter of legislation to modernize the financial system. The Board also has been a strong proponent both of expanded financial activities for banking organizations and enhanced opportunities for nonbank financial institutions to enter banking. We continue to support financial modernization because we believe it would provide improved financial services for our citizens. Moreover  both our experience and analysis suggest that the additional risks of new financial products are modest and manageable. Indeed  technology already has resulted in a blurring of product and service-defining lines so dramatic as to make many financial products virtually indistinguishable from each other and the old rules inapplicable. In the process  we have already seen the public benefits  benefits that removal of old barriers could only enhance. But  as we proceed down the path of reform  reforms both desired for their benefits to the public and required by global markets and new technologies  the Board urges that any modifications be tested against certain standards. In particular  the Board believes that the changes we adopt should be consistent with (1) continuing the safety and soundness of the banking system; (2) limiting systemic risks; (3) contributing to macroeconomic stability; and (4) limiting the spread of both the moral hazard and the subsidy implicit in the safety net. Thus  if my comments today sound cautious  I want the subcommittee to understand that my observations do not reflect opposition to further freeing of constraints on financial competition. To the contrary. We strongly urge an extensive increase in the activities permitted to banking organizations and other financial institutions  provided these activities are financed at nonsubsidized market rates and do not pose unacceptable risks to our financial system. While a level playing field requires broader powers  it does not require subsidized ones. Safety Net Implications In this century the Congress has delegated the use of the sovereign credit -- the power to create money and borrow unlimited funds at the lowest possible rate -- to support the banking system. It has done so indirectly as a consequence of deposit insurance  Federal Reserve discount window access  and final riskless settlement of payment system transactions. The public policy purpose was to protect depositors  stem bank runs  and lower the level of risk to the financial system from the insolvency of individual institutions. In insuring depositors  the government  through the FDIC  substituted its unsurpassable credit rating for those of banks. Similarly  provisions of the Federal Reserve Act enabled banks to convert illiquid assets  such as loans  into riskless assets (deposits at the central bank) through the discount window  and to BIS Review 16/1997 - 2 - complete payments using Federal Reserve credits. All these uses of the sovereign credit have dramatically improved the soundness of our banking system and the public’s confidence in it. In the process  it has profoundly altered the risks and returns in banking. Sovereign credit guarantees have significantly reduced the amount of capital that banks and other depositories need to hold  since creditors demand less of a buffer to protect themselves from the failure of institutions that are the beneficiaries of such guarantees. In different language  these entities have been able to operate with a much higher degree of leverage -- that is  to obtain more of their funds from other than the owners of the organization -- than virtually all other financial institutions. At the same time  depositories have been able to take greater risk in their portfolios than would otherwise be the case  because private creditors -- depositors and others -- are less affected by the illiquidity of  or losses on  the banks’ portfolios. The end result has been a higher risk-adjusted rate of return on depository institution equity. Moreover  the enhanced ability to take risk has contributed to economic growth  while the discount window and deposit insurance have contributed to our macroeconomic stability. But all good things have their price. The use of the sovereign credit in banking -- even its potential use -- creates a moral hazard that distorts the incentives for banks: the banks determine the level of risk-taking and receive the gains therefrom  but do not bear the full costs of that risk. The remainder of the risk is transferred to the government. This then creates the necessity for the government to limit the degree of risk it absorbs by writing rules under which banks operate  and imposing on these entities supervision by its agents -- the banking regulators -- to assure adherence to these rules. The experience in the 1980s with many insured thrift institutions showed just how dangerous lax enforcement of supervisory rules can be. In the end  some hard lessons were learned  many of which were legislated into the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991. The subsidy to the banking and other depositories created by the use of the unsurpassable sovereign credit rating of the United States government is an undesirable but unavoidable consequence of creating a safety net. Indeed  one measure of the effectiveness of a safety net is our ability to minimize the subsidy and limit its incidence outside of the area to which it was directed. Some of the value of the subsidy has been passed to depositors of  and borrowers from  banks  for example  as well as to the original bank shareholders. But  the United States government has been remarkably successful in containing the value of most of the subsidy within depository institutions. The bank holding company organizational structure has  on balance  provided an effective means of limiting the use of the sovereign credit subsidy by other parts of the banking organization. To be sure  bank holding companies have indirectly benefited from the subsidy because their major assets are subsidiary banks. The value of the subsidy given to the subsidiary banks has no doubt been capitalized in part into the share prices of holding companies and has improved their debt ratings  lowering their cost of capital. But  holding companies also own nonsubsidized entities that have no direct access to the safety net. Accordingly  both bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries have a higher cost of capital than banks. This is clear in the debt ratings of bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies  which are virtually always higher than those of their parent holding companies. Moreover  existing law and regulation under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act require that any credit extended by a bank to its parent or affiliate not only be totally collateralized and subject to quantitative limits  but also be extended at arms-length and at market rates  making a direct transfer of the safety net subsidy difficult. BIS Review 16/1997 - 3 - It is true that a bank could pay dividends from its earnings  earnings which have been enhanced by the safety net subsidy  to fund its parent’s nonbank affiliates. However  the evidence appears to be that such transfers generally do not occur. Existing holding company powers are limited and do not offer a broad spectrum of profitable opportunities. Accordingly  it is not surprising that data for the top 50 bank holding companies indicate that transfers from bank subsidiaries to their parents which  like dividends  embody the subsidy  appear to have approximately equaled holding company net transfers to their own shareholders and long-term creditors. This indicates that few subsidized dollars in the aggregate found their way into the equity accounts of holding company nonbank affiliates from the upstreaming of bank funds. We must  I think  be continually on guard that the subsidy provided by the safety net does not leak outside the institutions for which it was intended and provide a broad subsidy to other kinds of activities. Put another way  we must remain especially vigilant in maintaining a proper balance between a safety net that fosters economic and financial stabilization and one that benefits the competitive position of private businesses for no particular public purpose. As I noted  safety net subsidies have costs in terms of distorted incentives and misallocated resources. That is why the Congress must be cautious in how the sovereign credit is used. It has been suggested that the bank holding company structure imposes inefficiencies on banking organizations  and that these organizations should thus be given the option of conducting expanded financial activities in a direct subsidiary of the bank. The bank subsidiary may be a marginally more efficient way of delivering such services  but we believe it cannot avoid being a funnel for transferring the sovereign credit subsidy directly from the bank to finance the new powers  thereby imparting a subsidized competitive advantage to the subsidiary of the bank. One can devise rules -- such as 23A and 23B -- to assure that loans from the bank to its own subsidiaries are limited and at market rates. One can even devise rules to limit the aggregate equity investment made by banks in their subsidiaries. But one cannot eliminate the fact that the equity invested in subsidiaries is funded by the sum of insured deposits and other bank borrowings that directly benefit from the subsidy of the safety net. Thus  inevitably  a bank subsidiary must have lower costs of capital than an independent entity and even a subsidiary of the bank’s parent. Indeed  one would expect that a rational banking organization would  as much as possible  shift its nonbank activity from the bank holding company structure to the bank subsidiary structure. Such a shift from affiliates to bank subsidiaries would increase the subsidy and the competitive advantage of the entire banking organization relative to its nonbank competitors. I am aware that these are often viewed as only highly technical issues  and hence ones that are in the end  of little significance. I do not think so. The issue of the use of the sovereign credit is central to how our financial system will allocate credit  and hence real resources  the kinds of risk it takes  and the degree of supervision it requires. If the Congress wants to extend the use of the sovereign credit further  to achieve a wider range over which the benefits of doing so can accrue  it ought to make that decision explicitly  and accept the consequences of the subsidy on the financial system that come with it. But  it should not  in the name of some technical change  or in search of some minor efficiency  inadvertently expand the use of the sovereign credit. This issue would not be so important were we not in the process of addressing what must surely be a watershed in the revamping of our regulatory structure. We must avoid inadvertently extending the safety net and its associated subsidy without a thorough understanding of the implications of such an extension to the competitive balance and systemic risks of our financial system. BIS Review 16/1997 - 4 - Central to the Board’s choice of a financial structure is its desire for one that will be most effective in fostering both a viable financial system and a vibrant economy. These objectives  in our view  would be thwarted if the safety net subsidy directly benefited new activities. With the safety net comes the moral hazard of which I spoke earlier  and its attendant misallocation of resources  and uneven competitive playing field. If the government subsidies directed to banks were channeled to bank subsidiaries  in my judgement  both the benefits and enumerated costs to the financial system and the public would occur. If banks were permitted to engage in new activities in their own subsidiaries  inevitably virtually all holding companies would shift those activities now conducted in holding company affiliates to bank subsidiaries  eviscerating the holding company structure. Were such shifts to happen solely as the result of operational efficiencies  no one  including the Board  should mourn the demise of the holding company. But if  as I suspect  such shifts occurred because of the attraction of a government subsidy  we should be concerned because the insidious effects of such subsidies would have spread. The evidence from flows between banks and their parents  relative bond ratings  and the administration of Sections 23A and B of the Federal Reserve Act  all strongly suggest that the holding company structure is far more capable of containing the sovereign credit subsidy whose purpose is support of the safety net  not providing expanded competitive advantage. As new activities hopefully expand for banking organizations  we believe that it is essential that we assure they are financed at market rates  not subsidized ones. This will not always be easy. Containment of subsidies is often implemented through firewalls and other devices which could also inhibit the very synergies which the expansion of activities is meant to achieve. But we have dealt with these trade-offs before and should be able to in the future as well. Umbrella Supervision Whether new activities are authorized in bank subsidiaries  bank holding companies  or both  Congress  in its review of financial modernization  must consider legal entity supervision versus umbrella supervision. The Board believes that umbrella supervision is a realistic necessity for the protection of our financial system and to limit any misuse of the sovereign credit. The bank holding company organization is increasingly being managed so as to take advantage of the synergies between its component parts in order to deliver better products to the market and higher returns to stockholders. Such synergies cannot occur if the model of the holding company is one in which the parent is just  in effect  a portfolio investor in its subsidiary. Indeed  virtually all of the large holding companies now operate as integrated units and are managed as such. As bank holding companies began to widen their activities  and as new technologies permitted not only the development of new products but also the systems for controlling them  the banking organization was impelled to develop centralized risk control techniques that crossed legal entities. Today  risk management for the entire company is increasingly centralized not only at the larger and more sophisticated banking organizations  but at other large financial services providers as well. This development reflects the demands of the marketplace  which views banks and their affiliates and other financial businesses and their affiliates as integrated organizations in terms of financial condition  management  and reputation. BIS Review 16/1997 - 5 - To understand the risk controls of the bank  we have first to come to grips with the fact that the organization is interested in risk and its control  not by instrument or legal entity  but for the entire business. This type of control is being adopted by more and more organizations each year  and can only increase as more activities are authorized by the regulators and the Congress. Regulatory policies and operating procedures have had to respond to these realities  to focus on the process of decisionmaking for the total organization. Thus  the Federal Reserve -- the historical umbrella supervisor -- also has found it necessary to concentrate more on the process that banking organizations use to manage market  credit  operating and exchange rate risk  and less on the traditional after-the-fact evaluation of balance sheets that can and often do change dramatically the day after they have been reviewed by the supervisors. In such a world  process  if not everything  is critical  and that process is determined increasingly at the parent holding company for all of the units of the organization on a consolidated basis. One could argue -- as several witnesses appearing before this subcommittee did on Tuesday -- that regulators should only be interested in the entities they regulate and  hence  review the risk evaluation process only as it relates to their regulated entity. Presumably each regulator of each entity -- the bank regulators  the SEC  the state insurance and finance company authorities -- would look only at how the risk management process affected their units. It is our belief that this simply will not be adequate. Risks managed on a consolidated basis cannot be reviewed on an individual legal entity basis by different supervisors. Indeed  our experience has been that a problem in one legal entity can have a contagion effect in other entities. If a bank affiliate begins to have difficulty  the market evaluates the problem as the consolidated entity’s problem and can bring pressure on all the units. These pressures usually take the form of funding or liquidity difficulties  as creditors seek to reduce their exposure to all units of an organization that seems to be having trouble. Better safe than sorry. Indeed  it is in the cauldron of the payments and settlement system  where decisions involving large sums must be made in short periods  that this contagion effect might be first seen as participants understandably seek to protect themselves from the uncertainty that accompanies this contagion effect. And that is how crises often begin. These concerns were part of the motivation for the congressional decision just five years ago to require that foreign banks could enter the United States if  and only if  they were subject to consolidated supervision. This decision  which is consistent with the international standards for consolidated supervision of banking organizations  was a good decision then. It is a good decision today  especially for those banking organizations whose disruption could cause major financial disturbances in United States and foreign markets. For foreign and for U.S. banking organizations  retreat from consolidated supervision would  the Board believes  be a significant step backward. We have to be careful  however  that consolidated umbrella supervision does not inadvertently so hamper the decisionmaking process of banking organizations as to render them ineffectual. The Federal Reserve Board is accordingly in the process of reviewing its supervisory structure and other procedures in order to reflect the aforementioned market-directed shift from conventional balance sheet auditing to evaluation of the internal risk management process. Although focused on the key risk management processes  it would sharply reduce routine supervisory umbrella presence in holding companies. As the committee knows  the Board has recently published for comment proposals to expedite the applications process  and the legislation Congress enacted last year eased such procedures as well. Nonetheless  the Board requests even greater modification to its existing statutory mandate so that the required BIS Review 16/1997 - 6 - applications process could be sharply cut back  particularly in the area of nonbank financial services. We would hope that should the Congress authorize wider activities for financial services holding companies that it recognize that a bank which is a minor part of such an organization (and its associated safety net) can be protected through adequate bank capital requirements and the application of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The case is weak  in our judgment  for umbrella supervision of a holding company which  because it owns only a small bank  does not have material access to the safety net. As I noted when discussing the safety net and bank subsidiaries  attached to all uses of the sovereign credit come efforts by the government to protect the taxpayer. Those entities interested in banks are really interested in access to the safety net  since it is far easier to engage in the nonsafety net activities of banks without acquiring a bank. If an organization chooses to deliver some of its services with the aid of the sovereign credit by acquiring a bank  it should not be excused from efforts of the government to look out for the stability of the overall financial system. For bank holding companies that own more than a small bank  this implies umbrella supervision. Although that process will increasingly be designed to reduce supervisory presence and be as nonintrusive as possible  umbrella supervision should not be eliminated  but recognized for what it is: the cost of obtaining a subsidy. Banking and Commerce Finally  let me turn to an issue that has bedeviled supervisory and regulatory discussions for years: the potential separation of commerce and banking. As I indicated earlier  it is clear that rapidly changing technologies are altering the nature of what constitutes finance. Indeed  just as the lines between banking and other financial institutions are often already difficult to discern  the boundaries between finance and nonfinance are likely to become increasingly indistinct as we move into the 21st century. For example  computer and software firms will certainly be offering ever more sophisticated financial products. And doubtless financial firms will be offering an increasingly sophisticated array of nonfinancial services. In addition  some of the financial firms who mainly produce products and services that many observers believe should be permissible to banks are also engaged in  or affiliated with  nonfinancial businesses. Newer technologies will make it highly unlikely that the walling off of any ownership of financial institutions by nonfinancial businesses and vice-versa can be continued very far into the 21st century. Nonetheless  the Board has concluded that it would be wise to move with caution in addressing the removal of the current legal barriers between commerce and banking. The free and open legal association of banking and commerce would be a profound and surely irreversible structural change in the American economy. Hence  we must be careful to assure ourselves that whatever changes are made in our supervisory structure  that it not distort our evolution to the most efficient financial structure as we move into the next century. Were we fully confident of how the structure would evolve  we could presumably construct today the regulations which would foster that evolution. But we cannot be certain. We thus run the risk of locking in a set of inappropriate regulations that could adversely alter the development of market structures. We cannot be confident we know what the true synergies between finance and nonfinance will be in ten or even five years. Our ability to foresee accurately the future implications of technologies and market developments in banking  as in BIS Review 16/1997 - 7 - other industries  has not been particularly impressive. As Professor Rosenberg of Stanford University has pointed out  "". . . mistaken forecasts of future structure litter our financial landscape."" Consider the view of the 1960s that the ""cashless society"" was imminent. Nonetheless  the public preference for paper has declined only gradually. Similarly  just a few years ago conventional wisdom argued that banks were dinosaurs that were becoming extinct. The reality today is far from it. Even more recently  it was argued that banks and nonfinancial firms had to merge in order to save the capital-starved banking system. Today  as you know  virtually all of our banks are very well capitalized. All these examples suggest that if we change the rules now about banking and commerce under circumstances of uncertainty about future synergies between finance and nonfinance  we might end up doing more harm than good. And  as with all rule changes by government  we are likely to find it impossible to correct our errors promptly. Modifications of such a fundamental structural rule as the separation of banking and commerce should accordingly proceed at a deliberate pace  testing the response of markets and technological innovation to the altered rules in the years ahead. The public needs to have confidence in the regulatory structure  implying that we proceed slowly and cautiously. Excessive delay  however  would doubtless produce some inequities. Expanded financial activities for banking organizations requires  the Board believes  that those firms operating in markets that banks can enter should  in turn  be authorized to engage in banking. However  some of these nonbanking financial firms already own -- or are owned by -- nonfinancial entities. A complete commerce and banking prohibition would thus require the divestiture of all nonfinancial activities by those organizations that wanted to acquire or establish banks. The principle of caution suggests an approach which may prove useful. Perhaps those organizations that either have or establish well-capitalized and well-managed bank subsidiaries should be permitted a small basket of nonfinancial assets -- a certain percentage of either consolidated assets or capital. A small permissible basket would establish  in effect  a pilot program to evaluate the efficacy of further breaching of the banking and commerce wall. We found that such a slow and deliberate policy worked well with Section 20 affiliates. Of course  some nonbanking firms would find that their nonfinancial activities would exceed a small basket exemption. Such excess nonconforming assets might be addressed on a case-by-case basis with a scheduled longer-term divestiture to avoid the worst short-term inequities. A basket clause plus case-by-case review of individual situations might also provide a way to make available a common bank and thrift charter to those unitary thrifts that are affiliated with nonfinancial businesses. The Board has no firm opinion on just exactly how such trade-offs might be made  constrained only by the general concerns I summarized earlier. BIS Review 16/1997"
r970219c,1997-02-19,https://www.bis.org/review/r970219c.pdf,Mr. Lamfalussy looks at the progress achieved by the Hungarian economy in recent years (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  7 Feb 97),Address by the President of the European Monetary Institute  Mr. Alexandre Lamfalussy  at a conference organised by the Hungarian Banking Association on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the new Hungarian banking system and held in Budapest on 7/2/97.,Mr. Lamfalussy looks at the progress achieved by the Hungarian economy in recent years Address by the President of the European Monetary Institute  Mr. Alexandre Lamfalussy  at a conference organised by the Hungarian Banking Association on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the new Hungarian banking system and held in Budapest on 7/2/97. For at least three reasons  I have accepted with pleasure the invitation to share some thoughts with you on the occasion of these tenth anniversary celebrations. First  for obvious personal reasons  I enjoy spending some time in Hungary - even if it is only for less than a day. Second  I am absolutely convinced that an efficient financial system in general  and an efficient banking system in particular  together comprise an indispensable precondition for the proper functioning of a market economy and  indeed  for economic growth. Not a sufficient condition  but a necessary one. Third  I note that Hungary has made substantial progress in this direction in four key areas. The larger part of the Hungarian banking system is now in genuinely private hands; the financial health of most banks (which  not so long ago  was - to put it mildly - precarious) has improved; the legal  accounting and regulatory framework has been consolidated  and  last but not least  there is now an interbank payment system in place which can no longer be qualified as prehistoric. Admittedly  in all these areas progress is still possible and desirable  but what has been achieved so far now enables you to address a number of institutional issues for the solution of which Western experience is fast becoming increasingly and directly relevant. But before considering some of these issues  allow me to make some remarks about the macroeconomic situation of the Hungarian economy and about the new framework within which the National Bank of Hungary will be operating. Both these areas are of key importance for the management of your banks. At the same time  both have a bearing on Hungary’s declared intention to join the European Union (and within this  probably at a later stage  also EMU). Last but not least  both are important areas in themselves  irrespective of considerations relating to European integration. THE MACROECONOMIC SITUATION That there has been a significant improvement since mid-1995 in Hungary’s macroeconomic situation is beyond doubt. Here are a few facts and comments on some of the features of this improvement. 1. The current account deficit reached $3.5 billion in 1993 and almost $4 billion in 1994  i.e. more than 10% of GDP - an obviously unsustainable situation by any standards  but even more so for a country with a high debt ratio. Some of this deficit was covered by direct foreign investment  but the greater part of it was financed by borrowing  as a result of which by the end of 1994 the net external debt had reached 46% of GDP and the exceptionally high level of more than 160% of exports of goods and services and unrequited transfers. 2. I have not yet seen the full 1996 figures  but estimates based on the first eleven months suggest a current account deficit of around (or even less than) $1.5 billion. This looks much more reasonable  not only because it was more than covered by foreign direct investment but also because of what lies behind this improvement. The $2.5 billion drop in the current BIS Review 16/1997 - 2 - account deficit between 1994 and 1996 was made possible (a) by a 35% increase in exports  accompanied by a modest increase in imports of about 14%  and (b) by the steady and rapid increase in services income  mainly (but not exclusively) derived from tourism. 3. Since there was also a sizable inflow of foreign direct investment in 1995 and 1996  the country’s net external debt dropped from $18.9 billion at end-1994 to about $13.3 billion at end-1996. Net external debt declined to 31.2 expressed as a percentage of GDP  and to 71.6 as a percentage of exports of goods  services and unrequited transfers. I have also noted that by 1996 net interest payments on the external debt had dropped to 6.7 as a percentage of exports of goods and services. The comparable figures were 12% in 1994 and as high as 17% in 1990. It is useful to point out that the sizeable decline of the net external debt was made possible by the substantial decline of the public sector deficit from 8.2% of GDP in 1994 to 4% in 1996  while at the same time the share of public sector expenditure in GDP declined from 62% to a more bearable 51%. “Growing out” of the debt service burden is no longer wishful thinking. It is beginning to become a reality. 4. The fact I find most noteworthy is that the $2.5 billion switch of resources towards external use  amounting to some 7% of GDP  took place without a recession  which is unusual for such a large switch. It was even accompanied by a small increase in GDP. This would not have been possible without the fast growth of exports. The remarkable growth of labour productivity in industry - of close to 60% between 1992 and 1996 - played a major role in this respect. This growth  together with the changing composition of exports  suggests that the structural transformation of the Hungarian economy has gone quite far. The growth of net services exports points in the same direction. 5. So much for the bright side of the picture  which is a good thing but should not be overstated. First  these are improvements in comparison with the unsustainable imbalances which characterised both the situation prevailing in 1988-89 and that of the years 1993-94. Second  the price paid by the majority of Hungarians was very heavy indeed: a drop in net real earnings of 12% in 1995  followed by another of 4% last year. Even if this was arguably unavoidable  given the size of the imbalances which had to be corrected (and which themselves had been caused  to some extent at least  by the premature rise in real earnings in 1994)  the size of the sacrifices remains a fact. Against this background  any further erosion of average living standards would be just as unsustainable as were the macroeconomic imbalances in 1993-94. Third  the rate of inflation is still far too high. Admittedly  since the post- devaluation peak reached in the late spring of 1995 - of more than 30% - the rate has been declining steadily  to stand by December last year at a shade below 20%. But I am seriously worried by the fact that the Hungarian rate of inflation  while never moving towards three digits  has remained stuck within the 18-35% range over the past seven years. The worst was avoided by maintaining positive real interest rates during the greater part of this period  but the distorting effects of such inflation rates on the economy remain substantial  not to mention their socially unacceptable impact on those people whose earnings cannot be adjusted to inflation. 6. Looking ahead  I hope that you will bear with me if I become a little philosophical. All knowledgeable observers of Hungarian history  ancient as well as contemporary  agree that Hungarians possess the very rare ability to pull back at the last minute BIS Review 16/1997 - 3 - from the brink of disaster or at least to extricate themselves from a seemingly hopeless situation. They unfortunately also note that once the Hungarians have done so  they miss the opportunity offered by their own success to carry out policies with a long-term perspective in mind. I do hope that history will not repeat itself. Admittedly  any further decline in the average living standard would be unacceptable. The standard of living should be allowed to begin to rise - but only to the extent that this does not upset the basic balance of the economy again. At the same time  the reduction in inflation must continue at a pace which puts the attainment of single-digit inflation in sight. You must break out - downwards - of the 18 to 35% range. And  last but not least  the country will have to begin to tackle earnestly the major structural problems related to the pension  health care  education and social security systems. These are daunting challenges. Two reminders may help when tackling them. The first is that Hungary has managed major breakthroughs in the recent past which were just as difficult as these future challenges: over the past five years  real privatisation accompanied by a fundamental shift in the structure of industry and services; and  more recently  the handling of a macroeconomic crisis situation. The second is that most of these challenges are akin to those encountered by modern Western societies. For these challenges Hungary is in good company. THE MONETARY POLICY ENVIRONMENT Two recent changes have occurred regarding the institutional environment in which the National Bank of Hungary is operating. I welcome both of them. 1. The possibility of the direct financing of the budget deficit by the NBH has been eliminated. This is in conformity with the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty  and is a measure which has already been implemented by all fifteen member countries of the European Union and which the EMI closely monitors. To remind you  this provision of the Treaty applies to the member countries at this stage  prior to effectively entering EMU. It would seem to me impossible for Hungary to join the European Union without this change in the law governing the operations of the NBH  even if Hungary’s participation in the euro area were to come at a later stage. But this is only an institutional or political argument. There is more to it. Maastricht or no Maastricht  eliminating the direct monetary financing of budget deficits is simply economic common sense. In the long run  inflation is a monetary phenomenon: it cannot happen without an (at least) accommodating expansion of the money supply. And we know from historical experience that more often than not the major source of any such inflationary increase in the money supply has been the direct financing of government by the central bank. Hungary has not been an exception to this general rule - rather its confirmation. And once inflation is established  interest rates go up. Except for very short periods  it is impossible to keep market interest rates below the rate of inflation: who would be ready to undertake financial savings the remuneration of which would imply a loss in real financial wealth? To try to keep interest rates low by monetary financing of the government is a self-defeating device. It may work for a few months  but would end up producing more inflation and higher  not lower  interest rates - certainly higher nominal interest rates  but very likely also higher real rates. The simple reason for this is that people are not fools - at least not for a long time. Monetary financing of the government is therefore likely to combine two evils at the same time: inflation and high interest rates. BIS Review 16/1997 - 4 - 2. The accumulated and potential future losses of the NBH on account of its borrowings in foreign currency have been taken over by the government. This is a salutary cleaning-up operation which ought to have been carried out long ago. It has no consequences for the “real” economy. These borrowings have been undertaken in the past on government instruction and with government approval  with the NBH acting solely as an intermediary. The NBH’s only shareholder is the Hungarian State; the real burden of the State’s direct or indirect external borrowing has to be borne by the present or future taxpayers. This real burden was to some extent hidden by the “seigniorage” profits of the NBH  which had two consequences: they hid the size of this burden from public view; and they distorted the NBH’s accounts. As all experts know  the size of this double distortion was proportional to the rate of inflation  and was aggravated by the NBH’s sterilisation policy of large capital inflows  without which  however  inflation would not have been brought down from 30 to 20% within the past eighteen months. Sterilisation was therefore a wise policy; the real culprit is the rate of inflation  which is much higher in Hungary than in the countries whose currencies were used for borrowing. In a sentence: this long overdue measure serves both public transparency and democratic accountability (of both the government and the NBH) - even if the general public  or politicians  may be excused for not fully understanding the intricate interconnection between accounting procedures in a country with high inflation and the processes of the real economy. This is a good example of the generalised mess created by inflation. CHALLENGES FOR THE HUNGARIAN BANKS As I said right at the outset  it is now time to look ahead and begin to address some major issues for the Hungarian banks - issues which  thanks to the progress made over the past few years  are no longer totally dissimilar from those facing banks in western Europe. I intend to make a few comments on these  since they are issues on which I can possibly throw some light on the basis of my own professional experience. 1. The first is about the specificity of banking  i.e. about the possibility or desirability of clearly distinguishing banks  through rules and regulations  from other financial intermediaries. I noted that the recent changes in Hungarian banking law have implied a movement towards the de-specialisation of banks  notably in the field of securities transactions. I believe that a development towards the universal banking model is justified - on certain conditions. It is justified for two groups of reasons. the First  because financial innovation in general  and securitisation in particular  are traditionally neat distinction between banks and other financial breaking down intermediaries  indeed even between financial intermediation and financial markets  all over the world. Some time ago  banks were defined as financial intermediaries whose liabilities (mainly sight and short-term deposits) were equivalent to the money supply  and the money supply was defined as the total sum of bank liabilities. This nice circular definition kept academics  bank regulators and central bankers equally happy until the moment when financial innovation started blurring the distinction between money and other financial assets  and securitisation began blurring the distinction between financial intermediation and financial market operations. The proliferation of derivatives  financial futures and the like added to the confusion between balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. The result is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to identify banking on the basis of the old equivalence of “banking liabilities = money supply”. This has now been recognised in the sweeping deregulation of banking activities affecting the whole of western Europe and  though more cautiously  also the United States. In some cases this has gone so far as to allow the emergence of consolidated banking and insurance activities. BIS Review 16/1997 - 5 - Second  in a shorter Hungarian perspective  banks in Hungary have a head start on other financial intermediaries in collecting the financial savings of households and of the enterprise sector. Admittedly  Hungary badly needs the large-scale development of life assurance companies  pension funds  mutual funds and the like  i.e. all those institutional investors which can channel savings towards equity investment. But this takes time  since experience and human resources are rare and the reform of the pension system and of health services takes time. Banks should be allowed to fill the gap for the time being  by putting at the disposal of savers a wide variety of financial instruments. 2. Now let me come to the risks that a generalised move towards universal banking could entail  and the ways and means of containing them. The main risk  of course  is the emergence of conflicts of interest. One such potential conflict of interest may arise within any bank  between the bank’s own risk-taking activity and risk-taking for its customers. The classic example of this is the potential conflict of interest between credit-granting and securities underwriting  but this is only one example. The traditional way of avoiding the misuse of such conflict-creating situations is (a) to devise an organisational structure with clearly distinguishable lines of responsibility  (b) to avoid flows of “inside” information between the various activities  (c) to attribute to each activity costs  income and profits  and (d) to entrust external auditors with the surveillance of the systems put in place. The end-result will  of course  never be entirely safe. Moreover  the building of “Chinese walls” inside a multi-polar banking organisation may weaken  or even destroy  the synergy between those poles  i.e. it may undermine the rationale of a multi-polar organisation. I would not want  however  to overstate the internal conflict of interest argument. In the long run  the kind of conflict to which I have referred is unlikely to be very strong. In a longer-term perspective  no bank can afford to favour its own risk-taking activity at the expense of its customers - especially if auditing makes it certain that any misuse of the bank’s powers would come to light. 3. Another much more dangerous conflict of interest could arise where the bank is capable of exercising a decisive shareholding power in another non-banking firm  of which it is at the same time a major creditor. This could have unacceptable consequences not only for the firm’s other shareholders but  if the practice became widespread  could even lead to structural distortions for entire industries. To avoid this happening  I would favour rather strict regulations. For instance  mutual funds managed by banks should either have limits on the equity participation in individual firms or not have access to the firm’s Board. The same should apply  a fortiori  to any bank’s direct and permanent equity participation in a non-banking firm - unless  perhaps  the bank remains just a shareholder (as if it were  say  a pension fund)  without direct banking operations with the firm in question. 4. Under the last point  I already touched on one particular aspect of corporate governance  namely when a bank can play a decisive role in a non-banking firm’s life. But you will also have to face up to the reverse problem: when a non-banking firm becomes a bank’s key shareholder and could therefore potentially induce risk-taking by the bank in its favour  at the expense of the bank’s other shareholders or of its depositors or customers. This is a particularly acute danger in countries where there are not many non-bank institutional shareholders  where the defence of minority shareholders has no tradition and where depositors are not properly protected. Such problems have been encountered in Western market economies. It is clearly in Hungary’s interest to build up  or consolidate  the appropriate defences against the emergence of such problems. BIS Review 16/1997 - 6 - 5. In order to avoid any misunderstandings  I am not launching any appeal in favour of overregulation. In a market economy  the best regulator is the market itself. And when spontaneous market regulation fails - which does happen - the second-best solution is to use regulatory techniques which favour the emergence of market-led self-regulation. I am simply trying to make two points. First  that banking and finance have broader and more general implications for the economy as a whole than any other kind of activity. A crisis in  say  the steel industry creates hardship  but it does not create a general crisis. A banking crisis may well do so. Second  banking and finance are evolving at a very fast pace under the combined influence of technological progress  innovation and globalisation. This needs a careful adjustment of the regulatory framework  not its general weakening. 6. In a very different area  may I call your attention to the need to develop both retail banking in the narrow sense of the term and also banking services to the dynamic sector of small and medium-sized enterprises. is vastly underdeveloped  both in the number of consumer-friendly local offices and  even more importantly  in the range of high-quality banking services offered to these two groups of customers. This underdevelopment is particularly striking when it is compared with the sophistication of some of the wholesale banking activities being offered. fields  Hungarian banking these In This is most regrettable and goes against the long-term interests of the banks themselves  not to mention those of the country. Households are  and will remain  the major source of the country’s financial savings. They deserve to be supplied with appropriate  safe and diversified vehicles which allow them to find an outlet for their financial wealth. Some small and medium-sized firms are net savers; others desperately need financing for development purposes  which financial markets will not be able to provide for a very long time indeed. I have known of a number of western European and even North American banks which derived great strength from their solid retail banking basis  which helped them considerably in situations in which some  if not many  of their cherished wholesale customers went bust. You will also need the retail banking basis for another reason. Satisfied household and small enterprise customers provide you with the greatest public support. And I can assure you that you will need this support in a democratic society. Banking has never been  and is unlikely to become  a popular activity  especially when it relies exclusively on customers recruited from among large corporations and very wealthy individuals. Beware of the danger of political backlash. In developing your retail activities  you will have to monitor western European experiences carefully. Many western European countries are overbanked in this field  and a good deal of discussion is focusing on the merits of customer proximity versus home-computer banking. My feeling is that you will be able to avoid some of the earlier western European excesses  and rely directly on the most recent communications and information systems technology. But for a long time to come  most of your customers will need close  human proximity. The comparative assessment of the costs and benefits of these two approaches will be a very great challenge for the Hungarian banking system. I hope that in ten years’ time  if I am still around  I shall be able to congratulate you on having been able to successfully meet this challenge. Meanwhile  I wish you good luck - and the ability to help the emergence of good luck by hard work  skilful management and good strategic choices. BIS Review 16/1997

As in previous years  the Reserve Bank has developed a conference program that is quite timely. Changes in technology have permitted the development in recent years of increasingly diverse financial instruments and intensely competitive market structures. The rapid evolution of products and markets has led many to conclude that market regulatory structures  many of which were established in the 1920s and 1930s  have become increasingly outdated. Some see new products and markets not covered by government regulation and fear the consequences of so-called “regulatory gaps.” Others see old government regulations applied to new instruments and markets and fear the unintended consequences of what seems unnecessary and burdensome regulation. Nowhere have these tensions been more evident than in the ongoing debate over the appropriate government regulation of derivative contracts  a debate which has varied in intensity but has never fully subsided for at least ten years. Recent efforts by members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to clarify and rationalize the regulation of derivative contracts under the Commodity Exchange Act have once again placed these contentious issues on the front burner. In my remarks today I shall proffer a set of considerations that I find quite valuable as a guide to decisions about the need for government regulation of financial markets. I shall then review the history of government regulation of derivative contracts and markets in the United States and consider the current regulatory structure for those products and markets in light of these considerations. Market Regulation I would argue that the first imperative when evaluating market regulation is to enunciate clearly the public policy objectives that government regulation would be intended to promote. What market characteristics do policymakers seek to encourage? Efficiency? Fair and open access? What phenomena do we wish to discourage or eliminate? Fraud  manipulation  or other unfair practices? Systemic instability? Without explicit answers to these questions  government regulation is unlikely to be effective. More likely  it will prove unnecessary  burdensome  and perhaps even contrary to what more careful consideration would reveal to be the underlying objectives. A second imperative  once public policy objectives are clearly specified  is to evaluate whether government regulation is necessary for those purposes. In making such evaluations  it is critically important to recognize that no market is ever truly unregulated. The self-interest of market participants generates private market regulation. Thus  the real question is not whether a market should be regulated. Rather  the real question is whether government intervention strengthens or weakens private regulation. If incentives for private market regulation are weak or if market participants lack the capabilities to pursue their interests effectively  then the introduction of government regulation may improve regulation. But if private market regulation is effective  then government regulation is at best unnecessary. At worst  the introduction of government regulation may actually weaken the effectiveness of regulation if government regulation is itself ineffective or undermines incentives for private market regulation. We must be aware that government regulation unavoidably involves some BIS Review 19/1997 - 2 - element of moral hazard -- if private market participants believe that government is protecting their interests  their own efforts to protect their interests will diminish to some degree. Whether government regulation is needed  and if so  what form of government regulation is optimal  depends critically on a market’s characteristics. A “one-size-fits-all” approach to financial market regulation is almost never appropriate. The degree and type of government regulation needed  if any  depends on the types of instruments traded  the types of market participants  and the nature of the relationships among market participants. To cite just one example  a government regulatory framework designed to protect retail investors from fraud or insolvency of brokers is unlikely to be necessary -- and is almost sure to be suboptimal -- if applied to a market in which large institutions transact on a principal-to-principal basis. Recognizing that a one-size-fits-all approach is seldom appropriate  it may be useful to offer transactors a choice between seeking the benefits and accepting the burdens of government regulation  or forgoing those benefits and avoiding those burdens by transacting in financial markets that are only privately regulated. In such circumstances  the privately regulated markets in effect provide a market test of the net benefits of government regulation. Migration of activity from government-regulated to privately regulated markets sends a signal to government regulators that many transactors believe the costs of regulation exceed the benefits. When such migration occurs  government regulators should consider carefully whether less regulation or different regulation would provide a better cost-benefit tradeoff without compromising public policy objectives. Historical Development of U.S. Government Regulation of Derivative Markets Before evaluating the current regulation of derivatives in light of these considerations  it is quite useful to know something of the history of these instruments and their regulation. Derivative contracts (forward contracts and options) appear to have been utilized throughout American history. Indeed  it will probably come as a surprise even to this audience that 15 to 25 percent of trades on the New York Stock Exchange in its early years were time bargains  that is  forward contracts  rather than transactions for cash settlement (in those days  same-day settlement) or regular-way settlement (next-day settlement). In the case of commodities  forward contracts for corn  wheat  and other grains came into common use by 1850 in Chicago  where they were known as “to arrive” contracts. The first organized futures exchange in the United States  the Chicago Board of Trade  evolved through the progressive standardization of the terms of “to arrive” contracts  including lot sizes  grades of grain  and delivery periods. Trading apparently was centralized on the Board of Trade by 1859  and in 1865 it set out detailed rules for the trading of highly standardized contracts quite similar to the grain futures contracts traded today. The first recorded instance of federal government regulation of derivatives was the Anti-Gold Futures Act of 1864  which prohibited the trading of gold futures. The government had been unhappy that its fiat currency issues  the infamous greenbacks  were at that time trading at a substantial discount to gold. Unwilling to accept this result as evidence of failure of the government’s monetary policies  Congress concluded that it was evidence of a serious failure of private market regulation. In the event  Congress’s action was followed by a further sharp drop in the value of the greenbacks. Although it took the government many years to restore monetary policy to a sound footing  it took Congress only two weeks to conclude that its prohibition of gold futures was having unintended consequences and to repeal the act. BIS Review 19/1997 - 3 - It has been the trading of agricultural futures  however  that from its inception has produced calls for government intervention. Throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries  farmers were often opposed to futures trading  particularly during periods when prices of their products were low or declining. They presumed that dreaded speculators were depressing their prices. The states were the first to respond to calls for government regulation of futures. For the most part  state legislation on futures was limited to prohibitions on bucket shops  that is  operations that purport to act as brokers of exchange-traded futures but “bucket” rather than execute their clients’ trades. An Illinois statute of 1874 signaled early concerns about market integrity. The statute criminalized the spreading of false rumors to influence commodity prices and attempts to corner commodity markets. After its misadventure with futures regulation during the Civil War  the federal government appears not to have given further consideration to regulating futures trading until 1883  when a bill was introduced in Congress to prohibit use of the mails to market futures. Thereafter  repeated efforts were made to regulate or prohibit trading of futures and options on agricultural products. When the Agriculture Department reviewed the Congressional Record in 1920  it found that 164 measures of this sort had previously been introduced. These efforts culminated in passage of the Futures Trading Act of 1921. That act was promptly declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court  on the grounds that it was a regulatory measure masquerading as a tax measure. But in 1922 Congress restated the purpose of the 1921 act as “an act for the prevention and removal of obstructions and burdens upon interstate commerce in grain  by regulating transactions on grain futures exchanges ” and renamed it the Grain Futures Act of 1922. As an explicitly regulatory measure  it was later upheld by the Court. The objective of the Grain Futures Act was to reduce or eliminate “sudden or unreasonable fluctuations” in the prices of grain on futures exchanges. The framers of the act believed that such sudden or unreasonable fluctuations of grain futures prices reflected their susceptibility to “speculation  manipulation  or control.” Moreover  such fluctuations in price were seen to have broad ramifications that affected the national public interest. Grain futures contracts were widely used by producers and distributors of grain to hedge the risks of price fluctuations. Futures prices also were widely disseminated and widely used as the basis for pricing grain transactions off the futures exchanges. Indeed  given the relative size of the agricultural sector of the time  fluctuations in futures prices no doubt had the potential to affect the economy as a whole. It is not entirely clear that the view that futures trading was exacerbating volatility in agricultural prices was well-founded. To be sure  evidence abounds that market participants talked incessantly about corners and bear raids. Moreover  the design of the contracts may  indeed  have made such contracts susceptible to manipulation. However  empirical studies of more recent experience cast doubt on whether the use of derivatives adds to price volatility. And  while charges of market manipulation are heard to this day  they typically are difficult  if not impossible  to prove. Professional speculators were easy to blame for fluctuations in market prices that actually reflected fundamental shifts in supply or demand  as they are today. The market clearing process is a very abstract concept. It is sometimes far easier to envisage price changes as the consequence of individual manipulators. Indeed  for a lot of nineteenth-century ring traders  it was some measure of manhood (women were few) that they could squeeze or corner a market. The evidence suggests that this was largely Walter Middy-type fantasy. In any event  the Grain Futures Act of 1922 established many of the key elements of our current regulatory framework for derivatives. In general  the act was designed to confine futures trading to regulated futures exchanges. The act made it unlawful to trade futures on BIS Review 19/1997 - 4 - exchanges other than those designated as contract markets by the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary was permitted to so designate an exchange only if certain conditions were met. These included the establishment of procedures for recordkeeping and reporting of futures transactions  for prevention of dissemination of false or misleading crop or market information  and for prevention of price manipulation or cornering of markets. Finally  the act recognized the need to permit bona fide derivatives transactions to be executed off of the regulated exchanges; it explicitly excluded forward contracts for the delivery of grain from the exchange-trading requirement. Forward contracts were essentially defined as contracts for future delivery to which farmers or farm interests were counterparties or in which the seller  if not a farmer  owned the grain at the time of making the contract. The next major piece of federal legislation affecting futures regulation was the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) of 1936. As in the case of the Grain Futures Act  an important objective of the CEA was to discourage forms of speculation that were seen as exacerbating price volatility. In addition  the CEA introduced provisions designed primarily to protect small investors in commodity futures  whose participation had been increasing and was viewed as beneficial. These provisions included requirements for the registration of futures commission merchants (FCMs)  that is  futures brokers  and for the segregation of customer funds from FCM funds. The CEA also expanded the coverage of futures regulation to cover contracts for cotton  rice  and certain other specifically enumerated commodities traded on futures exchanges  and prohibited the trading of options on commodities traded on futures exchanges. The federal regulatory framework for derivatives market regulation then remained substantially unchanged until 1974  when Congress enacted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act. The act did not make any fundamental changes in the objectives of derivatives regulation. However  it expanded the scope of the CEA quite significantly. In addition to creating the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as an independent agency and giving the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over commodity futures and options  the 1974 amendments expanded the CEA’s definition of “commodity” beyond a specific list of agricultural commodities to include “all other goods and articles  except onions  . . . and all services  rights  and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.” In one respect  this was sweeping deregulation  in that it explicitly allowed the trading on futures exchanges of contracts on virtually any underlying assets  including financial instruments. Only onion futures  banned in 1958 as the presumed favorite plaything of manipulators  remained beyond the pale. In another respect  however  this was a sweeping extension of regulation. Given this broad definition of a commodity and an equally broad interpretation of what constitutes a futures contract  this change brought a tremendous range of off-exchange transactions potentially within the scope of the CEA. In particular  it could be interpreted to extend the broad prohibition on off-exchange trading of futures to an immense volume of diverse transactions that never had been traded on exchanges. The potential for the legality of a wider range of transactions to be called into question did not go unnoticed during debate on the 1974 act. In particular  the Treasury Department proposed language excluding off-exchange derivative transactions in foreign currency  government securities  and certain other financial instruments from the newly expanded CEA. This proposal was adopted by Congress and is known as the Treasury Amendment. In proposing the amendment  Treasury was primarily concerned with protecting foreign exchange markets from what it considered unnecessary and potentially harmful regulation. The foreign exchange markets clearly have quite different characteristics from markets for agricultural futures -- the markets for the major currencies are deep and  as some central banks have learned the hard way  they are extremely difficult to manipulate. BIS Review 19/1997 - 5 - Furthermore  participants in those markets  primarily banks and other financial institutions  and large corporations  would not seem to need  and certainly are not seeking  the protection of the CEA. Thus  there was  and is  no reason to presume that the regulatory framework of the CEA needs to be applied to the foreign exchange markets to achieve the public policy objectives that motivated the CEA. Indeed  the wholesale foreign exchange markets provide a clear and compelling example of how private parties can regulate markets quite effectively without government assistance. BIS Review 19/1997

Stals  at the Twentieth Annual Investment Conference of Société Générale Frankel Pollak (Pty) Ltd. in Johannesburg on 18/2/97. 1. A sharp decline in the net capital inflow from abroad set the financial scene for 1996 The most important change in the financial situation in South Africa last year was the sudden decline in the net inflow of capital from abroad that occurred in the first quarter. A number of adverse developments at the time combined to trigger an outflow of short-term capital. Coming after three years of rather strong rises in total domestic expenditure and a growing deficit in the current account of the balance of payments  the deterioration in the capital account led to an overall balance of payments deficit that created immediate shortages in the market for foreign exchange. After a record net capital inflow of more than R6 billion occurred in the fourth quarter of 1995  to bring the total net inflow for the year close to R20 billion  there was a small net outflow in the first quarter of 1996. The current account deficit was no longer covered by a net capital inflow and the exchange rate of the rand came under immediate pressure. With a low level of official foreign reserves  a growing deficit in the current account of the balance of payments and deteriorating prospects for a renewed inflow of capital into the country  participants in the market for foreign exchange became very nervous and reacted wildly to rumours  adverse political developments and negative news about the balance of payments  the foreign reserves  and domestic economic developments. The initial depreciation of the rand created negative expectations which became self-fulfilling  particularly as leads and lags in short-term trade financing also moved strongly against South Africa  and South Africans became more reluctant to enter into new foreign currency denominated commitments. The exchange rate of the rand  which in nominal terms showed an effective appreciation of 4.4 per cent from May 1995 up to the end of December 1995  then depreciated by 8 per cent in the first quarter of 1996  by 7.2 per cent in the second quarter  and by a further 9.5 per cent in the four months up to the end of October 1996. Over the first ten months of 1996  the effective depreciation of the rand in nominal terms exceeded 22 per cent. In real terms  this represented a depreciation of about 15 per cent. An ex post analysis of the composition of the capital in- and outflows of last year provides interesting information for a better understanding of the changes that took place. Initially  it was mainly a sudden reversal in the inflow of short-term capital in the form of inter-bank and trade related financing arrangements that triggered the shortages in the market for foreign exchange. As the exchange rate depreciated and South African residents became more concerned about possible losses on foreign currency exposures  long-term foreign loans were repaid without replacement or extensions. South Africans with existing short- and long-term foreign currency commitments covered their positions forward  and the Reserve Bank’s forward exchange book showed a sharp increase of the net oversold position. In the fourth quarter of last year  when short-term capital began to flow back again  there was a net outflow from the private sector of R6 billion in the form of longer-term capital  mostly for the repayment of maturing loans. BIS Review 19/1997 - 2 - Another interesting feature of the international capital flows last year was that foreigners remained important net portfolio investors in South African securities. Non-residents increased their holdings of South African equities listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange by R5.3 billion  and added a net amount of R3.4 billion to their holdings of South African bonds acquired through the South African bond market. This ostensibly “volatile” element of the capital flows was therefore not responsible for the problems that developed in the South African balance of payments last year. 2. Monetary policy faced with new challenges in a situation of a deteriorating balance of payments The abrupt decline in the capital inflows from abroad in the first quarter of 1996 confronted the monetary policy authorities with an unexpected new challenge. Since 1994  the Reserve Bank’s policy on international financial relations was to rebuild the country’s depleted official foreign reserves gradually  to relax the exchange controls on a step-by-step basis  and to restructure the market in foreign exchange gradually with the objective of enabling a more efficient market to determine not only the spot foreign exchange rate of the rand  but also the forward rate. Good progress was made on this road during 1994 and 1995  but the country was surely not yet in a position to withstand the adverse developments of early 1996  or to protect the exchange rate of the rand against a series of determined attacks in a rather vulnerable situation. The Reserve Bank realised that it was not in a position to defend the exchange rate of the rand by providing large amounts of foreign exchange from the official foreign reserves. At the time of the dramatic decline in the net capital inflow in February 1996  the Reserve Bank held about R15 billion in official foreign reserves  while the private banking sector held an additional amount of about R4 billion in liquid foreign assets. The total of R19 billion was the equivalent of about 8 weeks’ imports. Taking account of the growing deficit in the current account of the balance of payments  the Bank could only make limited amounts of foreign exchange available to ensure that no serious shortage of liquidity would develop that could create a panic on its own. The longer-term objectives of building up the foreign reserves to a more comfortable level  of reducing the role of the Reserve Bank in the forward foreign exchange market  and of phasing out the remaining foreign exchange controls were temporarily forced on the backburner  whilst monetary policy had to be directed more decisively towards an adjustment programme that would gradually restore stability in the market for foreign exchange. 3. The monetary policy adjustment programme Three basic deficiencies in the underlying economic fundamentals were identified at the time that contributed to the lack of confidence in the South African economy  and in the ability of the South African authorities to restore stability in the market for foreign exchange. Firstly  the growing deficit in the current account of the balance of payments had to be reversed  particularly after it became evident that the country could not rely on a permanent and sustainable large capital inflow from the rest of the world to cover an ever- increasing current deficit. Secondly  the imminent danger of escalating inflation  particularly after some depreciation in the exchange rate of the rand  had to be avoided. There was a real and perceived BIS Review 19/1997 - 3 - danger that South Africa was destined for a new vicious circle of depreciation-inflation- depreciation that would unavoidably lead to a further erosion of the country’s competitive position in the world markets. Thirdly  the escalating growth rates in the domestic monetary aggregates  such as the money supply and bank credit extension  had to be reversed. By accommodating the new inflationary pressures emanating from the depreciation of the rand on a continuous basis  monetary policy would obviously aggravate the situation. With only limited means at its disposal to finance the external deficit  South Africa had no alternative but to adjust the disequilibrium  mainly by reducing or eliminating the current account deficit. To achieve this objective  the following monetary policy strategy was followed: Not being in a position to fix the exchange rate at any predetermined level  a depreciation of the rand was unavoidable and had to be accepted as part of the solution to the problem. The Bank sold some foreign exchange from its official reserves  not with the intention to fix the exchange rate  but rather to provide liquidity to the market and to smooth the adjustment process. As the Reserve Bank sold foreign exchange to the market to partly finance the overall balance of payments deficit  domestic rand liquidity was drained from the banking system. It was imperative for the effective working of the adjustment process that the Reserve Bank would not replace the lost liquidity through  for example  purchases of financial assets from the banks through more active open-market operations. The decline in the domestic liquidity had to be reflected in the level of interest rates. Higher interest rates would not only serve to discourage the outflow of capital  but would also reduce the domestic demand for bank credit. The market trend for interest rates to rise could not be resisted. Monetary policy was therefore directed towards a reinforcement of and active support for a market adjustment process that would eventually restore equilibrium to the balance of payments. It was well understood that this process would not be painless  that the depreciation of the currency  the drainage of liquidity and the rising interest rates would all demand costs and sacrifices that would not be popular  and that the monetary authorities would be blamed by some ill-disposed observers for the dilemma. Any country that had established a good economic performance in one year on the basis of net capital inflow of R20 billion  and is then in the next year forced to perform on a net inflow of only R4 billion  is bound to go through some painful adjustment. South Africa was no exception. 4. The success of the monetary adjustment programme Important changes took place towards the end of last year  and particularly after October  in the underlying economic conditions that contributed to the financial disturbances of the preceding nine months. There was a marked slow-down in the rate of increase in real gross domestic expenditure. Official national accounts statistics for the fourth quarter are not yet available  but preliminary indications are that all the major components of gross domestic expenditure increased at lower rates in the second half than in the first half of last year. Total real gross domestic expenditure indeed declined somewhat from the first half to bring the rate of increase for the year more or less in line with the established growth rate of about 3 per cent in gross domestic product. The deficit in the current account of the balance of payments progressively BIS Review 19/1997 - 4 - declined from a seasonally adjusted annualised peak of R13 billion in the second quarter to about R9 billion in the third  and R5 billion in the fourth quarter of the year. The rates of increase in both bank credit extension to the private sector and in the money supply peaked in October 1996  before declining marginally in both November and December. The quarter-to-quarter growth in credit extension to the private sector (at seasonally adjusted and annualised rates)  decelerated from 22.4 per cent in the second quarter of 1996 to 16.6 per cent in the third quarter  and 11.8 per cent in the fourth quarter. In the case of the M3 money supply  the deceleration was from 21.2 per cent in the second  to 18.6 per cent in the third  and a mere 7.6 per cent in the fourth quarter. Not only the current account of the balance of payments improved  but also the capital account. In the first nine months of the year  capital inflows and outflows almost cancelled out  to leave a small net inflow of less than R1 billion for the nine months’ period. In the fourth quarter  however  the net capital inflow increased again to an estimated R3 billion. This capital inflow once again exceeded the unadjusted current account deficit with the result that the country’s net foreign reserves recovered some of the losses of the first nine months of the year. The pressure in the foreign exchange market receded slightly and the rand started appreciating in November last year. Over the two months November and December 1996  the effective nominal exchange rate of the rand appreciated by 1 per cent  and during the first six weeks of 1997 by a further 9.2 per cent. This appreciation therefore partly neutralised the adverse effects of the sharp depreciation of last year. It will  of course  not only be premature but also preposterous to claim the successes achieved in this process so far for monetary policy alone. Many other changes also took place in South Africa over the past year. There is now more political stability than a year ago; much progress has been made with the framing and implementation of the Government’s Macroeconomic Strategy for Growth  Employment and Redistribution (GEAR); the Minister of Finance has confirmed and showed his determination to continue with the required policy of financial discipline that will gradually reduce the deficit in the Budget as a percentage of gross domestic product. There is  however  still the danger of escalating inflation that cannot be swept under the carpet at this juncture. After reaching an acceptable low level of only 5.5 per cent over the twelve months up to April 1996  the rate of increase in the consumer price index escalated to 9.4 per cent in December 1996. Inflation  however  lags behind changes in the monetary aggregates and is  at this stage  still stimulated by the depreciation of the rand last year  and the relatively large increases in the money supply during the 1995/96 period. It is of the utmost importance  however  that a restrictive monetary policy shall now be retained to make sure that the rate of inflation will also gradually be tamed again. 5. Monetary policy options for 1997 It remains the main task and priority of monetary policy in South Africa to fight against inflation. During 1996  the disturbances in the foreign exchange market temporarily diverted the attention from this prime objective of monetary policy. Indeed  in the longer term  greater stability in the foreign exchange market will only become sustainable once the rate of inflation has been brought more or less in line with the average rate of inflation in the economies of our major trading partners and international competitors. Despite the periodic efforts of media reporters to extort a commitment from the authorities to a certain pre-defined exchange rate for the rand  it remains our view that in the contemporary complex market for foreign exchange  it is not possible to define an equilibrium exchange rate a priori  or  in the case of the South African Reserve Bank  with the limited BIS Review 19/1997 - 5 - amount of foreign exchange at its disposal  to manipulate the exchange rate of the rand permanently in any direction against market forces. As far as the Bank’s policy on foreign exchange is concerned  it is hoped that the more favourable conditions now experienced in the market will continue throughout 1997  and will enable us to pursue the longer-term objectives of: building up the total foreign reserves to a more comfortable level; reducing the Reserve Bank’s role in the forward foreign exchange market; and gradually phasing out the remaining exchange controls. To the extent that these three objectives provide conflicts within themselves  important policy decisions will have to be taken between the Bank and the Minister of Finance on the relative importance that should be attached to each one of the objectives in an appropriate policy matrix. With the attention now being refocused on domestic policy objectives  the rising rate of inflation has become a matter of major concern. In this situation  the Reserve Bank regards it as a minimum precondition for arresting this imminent threat to financial stability that the rates of increase in bank credit extension and in the money supply will be reduced soon to more acceptable levels. With the prospects for real growth in the economy at a rate of between 2 and 3 per cent  and the desire to keep inflation to below 10 per cent  the money supply should obviously not increase by more than about 10 per cent during the current calendar year. This will require the Reserve Bank to persist with a relatively restrictive monetary policy for the time being. BIS Review 19/1997

I I consider it a great honour to be invited to speak at the Conference of the Governors of South-East Asian Central Banks. Professor Tietmeyer was glad to receive your invitation and took it up with pleasure. He regrets very much that he is unable to be here. We regard the contacts and dialogue within the global central bank community as being most important and valuable. In addition  I would rate your invitation as being a reflection of your interest in Europe  and in economic and monetary developments there. Conversely  I can assure you that European interest in Asia has increased tremendously in recent years. We are full of admiration for your cultural and economic achievements. We Germans  in particular  are well aware that economic progress is neither a miracle nor a matter of luck. Economic success has to do with wise policy decisions. And it also has to do with the capabilities and industry of human beings. The present day and age is distinguished by progressive economic integration. It is taking place on two levels. The one level is regional integration. In many parts of the world the regions are moving more closely together. This is mostly due to economic factors: creating larger markets and free-trade areas  and structuring the division of labour more effectively. In Europe the economic motives are combined with political ones. The peoples of Europe have learned from past conflicts. Besides the economic merging  European integration is designed to help forestall tensions between countries and reconcile diverging interests. Incidentally  regional integration is celebrating anniversaries this year  both here in South-East Asia and in Europe. ASEAN will be thirty years old this year  and the European Union forty. The other level of integration is globalisation  which is galloping ahead. Here  several factors are combining and mutually reinforcing one another: the internal decisions many countries have taken to open up their markets  the easing of restrictions on multilateral trade and  in particular  the huge technological advances in telecommunications and data processing. Undoubtedly  one of the major challenges facing policy makers worldwide is that of fostering regional and global integration side by side  rather than in opposition to one another. It is a matter - as we say in German - of doing the one without failing to do the other. In the triangular global political relationship between Asia  North America and Europe  the transatlantic community between the European Union and North America  on the one hand  and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  on the other  already have an important part to play. I hope and confidently expect that in future the Asian-European link in this triangle will increase in significance. An important initial step in this direction was the first European-Asian Summit Meeting of Heads of State and Government here in Bangkok just under a year ago. BIS Review 18/1997 - 2 - II The two levels of integration are currently determining to a very large extent the work of European central banks. The challenges posed by the global markets are affecting all central banks worldwide in much the same way. But the tasks faced in the context of regional integration in Europe are unique. After all  under the Treaty of Maastricht Europe has set itself the target of a monetary union before the end of this century. The present year will be of crucial importance on the road to that goal. The timetable envisaged is as follows: the countries that will participate in the monetary union from the start will be ascertained in spring 1998. The participating countries will have to fulfil the following criteria  in particular: stable monetary conditions as regards the value of money  the exchange rate and the longer-term interest rate level  lastingly sustainable public finance  and an independent national central bank. Which countries that will be  will become manifest after the examination and decision next spring. To date  there have been forecasts  as well as some wishful thinking. But decisions or preliminary decisions have not been taken yet. Monetary union is due to begin in 1999. At that date the participating countries will irrevocably fix the exchange rates of their currencies and introduce the euro. From the first day onwards  the European Central Bank will assume full responsibility for monetary policy. National central banks will become members of the European System of Central Banks. On the basis of the decisions taken by the European Central Bank  they will then implement monetary policy decentrally (insofar as that is possible). Whereas the financial markets are expected to use the euro from as early as 1999  retail business is likely to go on using national currencies at first. This is because banknotes and coins denominated in euros are not due to be issued until the beginning of the year 2002. Without any doubt  the monetary union is an ambitious project. It implies  from the first day onwards  irrevocably fixed exchange rates between the participating countries and a single monetary policy; that is to say  a common central bank  identical central bank rates for all countries  a virtually uniform arsenal of policy instruments and much more besides. The euro will be a supranational currency. The single monetary policy will apply - unlike the situation in most other monetary areas - to several states that in other respects remain sovereign. On the one hand  the introduction of the euro will present new opportunities for integration. The economies of the participating countries will be able to grow more closely together. The Common Market will be afforded a new dimension. On the other hand  in order to realise the benefits  the euro area will have to fulfil two main conditions: First  the participating countries will have to be able (both economically and in terms of anti-inflation policy) permanently to relinquish the instrument of exchange rate adjustment relative to one another. And  second  the differing national traditions and structures which the countries bring into the monetary union will have to grow into a single whole. For instance  some countries have different policy traditions on issues such as: what part can and should monetary policy play in the real economy? BIS Review 18/1997 - 3 - which target has priority in the event of a conflict between domestic price stability and external exchange rate stability? In addition  national central banks have divergent backgrounds as regards their relations with the government and their standing in the eyes of the general public. In some cases  they also have different policy instruments  deployed in different ways. By such means  they have taken due account of the differing structures of the domestic banking system. Establishing a monetary union implies building sustainable bridges across these differences. The single currency calls for joint answers to the underlying issues of monetary policy. The prerequisites are being elaborated at three levels: First  the choice of the participants at the start of monetary union is vitally important. This is to ensure that the range of countries remains fairly homogeneous overall with respect to their maturity for anti-inflation policy. Second  the Treaty of Maastricht laid down the independence of the European Central Bank and of all the central banks participating in monetary union. The statute of the European Central Bank defines ensuring price stability as its priority target. In this way the Treaty gives an unambiguous answer to the question of the fundamental orientation of the future monetary union. It is designed as a community of stability. And third  the European Monetary Institute  as a forerunner of the European Central Bank  has been working in Frankfurt for three years now. III Under the auspices of the European Monetary Institute  we are preparing the organisational and technical framework for the decision on the single monetary policy and its implementation. The preparatory work makes up a long list: First of all  a strategy for harmonised monetary statistics was drawn up. Central banks are working together with the European Monetary Institute on the introduction of a real time gross settlement system (TARGET). The EMI Council has already decided on the design of the future euro banknotes. In its Framework Report  the European Monetary Institute has recently mapped out a framework for the future strategy and the arsenal of policy instruments. The policy instruments will be geared to market conditions  transparent and efficient. Open market operations will be at the centre of refinancing policy. Two standard tenders are envisaged: one tender running for two weeks (that will be the most important instrument)  accompanied by a second tender running for three months. In the case of the longer-term tender  national central banks  when assessing the eligibility of collateral  are to have the option of taking national financing patterns into account. Two standing facilities are available for providing or absorbing overnight liquidity. They form a corridor for the rate for day-to-day money and signal the prevailing monetary policy stance. In the shape of the Framework Report  the European Monetary Institute has already laid down a number of benchmarks for future European monetary policy. However  it cannot take all decisions away from the European Central Bank. This is because the ultimate decision on the strategy and the actual deployment of the policy instruments remains  of course  BIS Review 18/1997 - 4 - in the hands of the European Central Bank. After all  it bears the responsibility and must take the final decision. Hence  where there is still no consensus on the EMI Council  the decision remains pending for the time being. That applies  for instance  to the strategy. The Framework Report provides for an alternative between a two-tier strategy  with a monetary aggregate as the intermediate target  and the single-tier strategy of a direct inflation target. The Bundesbank strongly advocates the monetary targeting approach. Needless to say  we also recognise that managing a monetary aggregate is becoming more difficult under the conditions presented by current financial markets. But the European Central Bank could demonstrate its responsibility more clearly and more transparently by means of the monetary targeting strategy. And the virtual adoption of the strategy of the erstwhile anchor currency Deutsche Mark would be a token of continuity. Another unresolved question  for example  is the issue of minimum reserves. The European Monetary Institute is preparing the option. Then the European Central Bank will have to decide at a later date whether minimum reserves will be adopted  and in which form. In future  a great deal will depend on the European Central Bank. Many people are pinning their hopes and expectations of a stable euro on its independence and steadfastness. The biggest challenge facing the European Central Bank lies in its need to earn the requisite reputation and credibility as quickly as possible. This is in order to justify people’s hopes of a stable euro. And to enable it to weather the test to be expected from the global financial markets. The environment in which central banks (and other economic policy makers  too) operate has undergone a radical change in the last decade. IV are witnessing economic developments We professionalisation of investors  globalisation of financial markets. We are witnessing political reforms: deregulation of the domestic markets  liberalisation of border-crossing capital movements. We are witnessing technological breakthroughs in information and communications technology. the markets: in All these changes are interacting  reinforcing one another and constituting a new real world. This upheaval presents great opportunities. The international capital markets can operate more efficiently. Market transparency is increasing. Greater diversification of investment may help to allocate capital more effectively  in line with its marginal productivity. Risk management is becoming more efficient. The financial markets are better able to perform their transformation function. The markets are better able to reconcile savers’ and investors’ preferences with respect to maturities  batch sizes and risks. Nowadays the financial markets perform a monitoring function all around the clock. Those markets test countries’ policies. They scrutinise the lasting sustainability of public finance. They scrutinise the gearing of monetary policy to stability. Where they register doubt  they are able to penalise massively by siphoning off capital and imposing high capital market rates. Hence the financial markets  in their monitoring and sanctionative capacity  figure as valuable allies of a monetary policy geared to stability. BIS Review 18/1997 - 5 - At the same time  however  the financial markets often appear to give cause for concern. Many people are suspicious of the financial markets’ power. For the financial markets increasingly seem to be divesting themselves of the “subservient role” they are supposed to play. Such fears apply  for one thing  to the relations of the global financial markets with national monetary  economic and fiscal policy. Anonymous market forces constrict policy makers’ national room for manoeuvre. This may lead to tensions because domestic policy-making normally claims to be sovereign. But  at least insofar as the financial markets thereby lessen the scope for a monetary policy that is detrimental to stability and a fiscal policy that inflates debt  the economist will not deplore that fact unduly. For a policy that fosters inflation and exacerbates national debt widens scope  at the most  for a temporary period; in the longer run  any such scope is narrowed. But there is a second dimension to the misgivings that the financial markets are no longer duly performing their subservient function. That relates to the relations with the real economy. In itself  a high volatility of financial market prices may affect real economic decisions. For example  enterprises may increasingly switch to hedging against the risk of sharply fluctuating exchange rates not only by means of financial contracts such as currency futures  but also by diversifying the locations  in terms of different currency areas. Prolonged distortions  such as misalignments of exchange rates or bubbles in asset prices  are all the more problematic. It is not only that the financial markets distort real relationships. The relevant adjustments are often sudden and violent  as in the case of the European Monetary System early in the nineties  or of Mexico. It is precisely such crisis-like upheavals that prompt the question of whether and  if so  to what extent today’s financial markets have become more unstable  and whether systemic risk has increased? Some people fear that the advance of professionalism among fund managers and institutional investors  in particular  might increase the incidence of such dangers. Their thinking is determined primarily by the short-term performance of their portfolio. In certain situations  that may intensify the “herd instinct”  triggering a “rush to the exit”. At the same time  new financial instruments make it easier for them to incur higher risk positions. Swings in sentiment may then lead all the more easily to precarious situations. On the other hand  the greater international diversification of investments makes the markets fundamentally more resilient today. Furthermore  owing to the increased significance of the funds  relative to that of the banks  the creditor pattern is nowadays much more heterogeneous and more diversified. That reduces the risk of chain reactions. If the banks are less heavily involved  the danger of a liquidity crisis impairing the viability of the payment and settlement system decreases. After all  not every liquidity crisis poses a systemic risk. V Central banks - like other economic policy makers - must adjust to the reality represented by the global financial markets. That applies to all policy areas: monetary policy  exchange rate policy  banking supervision. Problematic developments in the financial markets are not as a rule exclusively inherent in those markets. They often also have to do with current or earlier policy decisions. Monetary policy itself must not be an uncertainty factor that fosters volatility. It must focus on continuity  must build confidence. Continuity  consistency  credibility - the three Cs denote the right direction. BIS Review 18/1997 - 6 - To be sure  a medium-term monetary policy geared to continuity is not always easy to pursue  with the present-day financial markets and their frequent volatility as a counterpart. But there is no alternative. By and large  a steady  sound policy stance is easier for an independent central bank  which is at least spared the turmoil of day-to-day politics. Its guiding principle for exchange rate policy must be: it must not set unrealistic objectives. It must take great care not to provide the markets with triggering points; that is to say  points on which the entire credibility of a system or a policy hinges. Then  the markets can undertake a test. And its guiding principle for banking supervision must be: financial conglomeration and market globalisation  in particular  call for closer cooperation in the field of banking supervision between the responsible national authorities and between the international supervisory bodies for banking  insurance and securities operations. This applies even if a complete restructuring of a supervisory regime outside the existing patterns of supervision is unlikely to be implemented in the foreseeable future. Present-day supervision does not seek to push the market into the background  but rather to reinforce it. Competition is meant to discipline. Supervision is not intended to get bogged down in details  but to draw up a few key rules. Risks must be covered. A minimum of transparency must be present. Above all  the sanctionative mechanism of the markets must continue to work. There must not be any bailing-out that fosters moral hazard. Banking supervision seeks to enhance competition. It is therefore not merely a matter of lessening systemic risk. It is also a matter of identical competitive conditions  along the lines of “same business  same risks  same rules”. I am glad that the banking supervisory authorities are now working together in Basle beyond the range of the G-10 countries alone. Although the responsibility will remain at national level in future  the closer international cooperation among national supervisory authorities will improve mutual information  in addition to devising common standards. VI Information and communication: these are the keywords for the interaction of the markets and for the globalisation of business. To my mind  information and communication must also be the keywords for collaboration among central banks; naturally at the regional level  and particularly at the global level  too. In this context  I continue to believe that the G-10 is a forum that is useful and has proved its worth. But  needless to say  global collaboration must be much more broadly based. It should encompass all major players. It is this conviction that has recently prompted the BIS to invite a number of central banks from South-East Asia to become new members. Furthermore  the G-10 working parties - the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision  the Euro-Currency Standing Committee  and the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems - have invited representatives of non-G-10 countries  in order increasingly to address questions connected with the emerging markets. At the same time  the Governors have enlarged their meetings in Basle. Non-members of the BIS are also being invited to take part in the informal discussions and make their views known. The discussions in Basle cover a wide variety of topics: the instruments  strategy and environment of monetary policy  questions of foreign exchange reserve policy  BIS Review 18/1997 - 7 - recent developments in the markets  such as changes in financial intermediation or electronic money  and much else besides. I am sure that such exchanges of views will enhance mutual understanding of the problems and the approaches to solutions. Needless to say  the conditions for central banks are heterogeneous all over the world. But even so - or precisely for that reason - collaboration at a global level may be fruitful. In any case  the globalised markets are pushing all central banks - regardless of their regional affiliation - in the same direction. Not in the sense that all central banks are forced to think or act in the same way. But no matter which actual policies a central bank may pursue  the globalised markets demand a high degree of solidarity. This is a current and future challenge facing every central bank in the world. BIS Review 18/1997

McDonough  at the Society of Investment Analysts in Dublin on 11/2/97.,Mr. McDonough assesses the role of the central bank in ensuring a stable price and financial environment and fostering sustainable growth Remarks by the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  Mr. William J. McDonough  at the Society of Investment Analysts in Dublin on 11/2/97. I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the Society of Investment Analysts here in Ireland  home of my forebears. In my remarks this evening  I want to say a few words on a topic of great importance to both our professions: the role of central banks in ensuring a stable price and financial environment  and fostering sustainable growth. I would also like to offer some thoughts on the importance of a safe and sound banking system for the well- being of the economy. As members of the financial community  we all recognize the importance of price stability to the successful long-run performance of the economy. Indeed  there now seems to be a worldwide convergence of views among central bankers and investors alike on the importance of price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy. For me personally  stable prices have always been the prism for making monetary policy decisions. As I see it  price stability must be viewed in a long-run context as an ongoing goal  not a one-time objective. That goal requires monetary policy to be oriented beyond the horizon of its immediate or near-term impact on inflation and the economy. The primary purpose of near-term policy actions should be to set the economy on a long-term  permanent path to price stability and sound economic growth. This orientation puts the focus of policy on inflation expectations over the long term -- the time horizon that is appropriate for most saving and investment decisions. Businesses and households are understandably concerned about the long-term consequences of inflation and price level uncertainty. This is the frame of reference reflected in the conceptual definition of price stability offered by the chairman of the Federal Reserve  Alan Greenspan -- that price stability is achieved when people do not consider inflation a factor in their business and economic decisions. Long-term inflation expectations must be anchored to a transparent and rigorous commitment by the central bank to a well-defined standard of price stability  and unavoidable deviations from the goal of price stability must be explained with reference to that standard. In my view  price stability is a means to an end -- the promotion of sustainable economic growth. Only with long-term price stability can the economy expect to achieve the maximum levels of productivity and living standards. Price stability is both important and desirable because a rising price level  even at moderate rates  imposes substantial economic costs on society. These costs emanate from a variety of sources  including: increased uncertainty about the outcome of business decisions and - profitability; - inflation with the tax system; - - activities. adverse effects on the cost of capital resulting from the interaction of reduced effectiveness of the price and market systems; and distortions that create perverse incentives to engage in nonproductive BIS Review 17/1997 - 2 - As a former commercial banker  I am especially aware of the negative effects of one particular type of nonproductive activity induced by inflation’s distortion of incentives -- the overinvestment of resources in the financial sector. It is well known that  in high-inflation economies  the resources diverted from productive activities to nonproductive financial transactions are enormous. But even moderate inflation rates can cause substantial diversion to nonproductive financial activities  and this diversion deserves greater attention than it often receives in economists’ list of the costs of inflation. As I look back over the last ten years or so  I am pleased that the Federal Reserve and many other central banks have been successful in controlling price pressures and putting inflation on a long-run downward track. Success in dealing with inflation clearly enhances the credibility of monetary policy and policy makers. From my perspective  the continuing challenge for central banks is to ensure long-term credibility for monetary policy by sustaining low inflation environments. Central banks are generally better able to meet this challenge if they are substantially immunized from short-term political pressures  and are firmly committed to price stability as the overriding goal of monetary policy. Empirical research in recent years has shown that both the average rate of inflation and its variability tend to decline in tandem with increased independence for central banks. This is why so many governments  including those among the emerging market economies  have been providing their central banks with increased autonomy. Of course  it is possible to have low inflation or price stability even with a limited degree of legal central bank independence  but the record clearly shows that a country is more likely to have low inflation if its central bank is independent. One important reason for this is that the fiscal authorities in many countries have not proven to be highly disciplined. Of course  some would argue that focusing on price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy means that central banks would no longer be concerned about output or job growth. I believe this view simply is wrong. A stable price and financial environment almost certainly enhances the capacity of monetary policy to fight occasions of cyclical weakness in the economy. A central bank’s commitment to price stability over the longer term does not mean that monetary policy can ignore the short-term impact of economic events. It is important to recognize that  even when an economy is set on the path to price stability  and price expectations are contained  it does not necessarily mean that all potential sources of inflationary shocks have been eliminated. Moreover  while there is no long-run trade-off between unemployment  or output  and inflation  both formal evidence and common sense observation on wage and price rigidities attest to the existence of such a trade-off in the short run. In the long run  however  monetary policy’s impact is only on inflation; potential output primarily is determined by advances in technology  growth in human and physical capital and other real resources. Because of the uncertainty about the timing and significance of short-term monetary policy effects on economic activity  as well as all other uncertainties concerning the economy  there are always differences of view about the speed with which policy should be adjusted  and on the balance of risks in dealing with ongoing economic developments. These conflicts become more marked when an economy confronts supply shocks that drive up prices BIS Review 17/1997 - 3 - sharply and suddenly -- such as the two oil shocks of the 1970s. In those circumstances  from my perspective  the appropriate course  consistent with maintaining longer term price stability  should be to bring inflation down somewhat gradually  as the economy adjusts to the shift in relative prices. As I see it  monetary policy must be formulated cautiously  and cannot ignore business cycle developments. In establishing price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy  therefore  it is best to recognize that monetary policy does affect output in the short run. A central bank can appropriately be assigned the task of promoting sustainable economic growth  while maintaining long-term price stability and ensuring the health of the financial system. This way of articulating policy goals has the advantage of meeting the public’s need to understand the basis for monetary policy decisions  and may help  therefore  to enhance the democratic accountability of monetary policy. Once monetary policy is firmly committed to price stability  how can a central bank best reach that goal? Clearly  at an operational level  no single formula or implementation strategy can be expected to succeed in all countries and under all circumstances; possible approaches can take many different forms. The choices depend on a country’s history  economic conditions  traditions and institutions. But all successful approaches share two important features: first  they focus on a long-term time horizon and  second  they provide a clear and public standard for the assessment of policy. What is most significant is not the specific way a central bank chooses to seek price stability  but rather the underlying commitment to that goal. While monetary policy aimed at long-run price stability is critical to fostering sustainable economic growth  central banks’ role in promoting growth and  more generally  a healthy economy goes beyond the conduct of monetary policy. Through involvement in financial regulation and supervision  as well as in the oversight of payments system operations  central banks play a key role in preserving and enhancing the safety and soundness of the banking and financial system. All of these central bank functions are mutually dependent and  together  highlight the fact that the structure and workings of the banking system are integral to a country’s financial stability and economic growth. Clearly  monetary policy cannot succeed in its mission if the underlying financial system is unstable. The importance of an efficient  safe and sound banking and financial system for a country’s long-term economic prospects cannot be overstated. In any market economy  the banking and financial system plays a central role in mobilizing a society’s savings and in channeling these savings into investment and other productive uses. This intermediation process is one of the core determinants of the pace of a country’s economic development. Moreover  the banking and financial system must facilitate transactions in an economy by ensuring that they can be effected safely and swiftly on an ongoing basis. Both buyers and sellers of goods and services must have confidence that instruments used to make payments will be honored and accepted by all parties. These crucial functions of transforming savings into productive uses and making payments are often taken for granted. But  in fact  it can be difficult to ensure that the legal and institutional framework within which these functions are performed is consistent with the often conflicting goals of free choice  economic efficiency  safety and financial market stability. BIS Review 17/1997 - 4 - Experience has proven that there is no easy way to shape financial institutions in a manner that appropriately balances these goals under changing economic conditions. Today  numerous countries -- including Ireland and the United States -- are considering which paths to follow in reforming and modernizing their banking industries. These deliberations are of great importance  because a well-functioning and stable banking and financial system is a critical foundation for long-run growth and prosperity of an economy. And such reform is inevitably difficult  for reasons which are a classic blend of political and economic considerations rooted in the crucial functions the banking system must perform in a market economy. Moreover  banking system reform is made all the more challenging by the fact that such reforms cannot be viewed in isolation from reforms in the central bank  or independent of those in the capital markets. In fact  the greatest challenge may lie in forging these individual pieces in such a way that they fit together in a cohesive whole that serves the dictates of stability  growth  and public confidence. For a financial system to mobilize and allocate a society’s savings successfully and facilitate day-to-day transactions  there must be a class of financial institutions and instruments that the public views as safe and convenient outlets for its savings. Of course  the single dominant class of institution that performs this crucial dual role as repository of a large part of society’s liquid savings  and the entity through which payments are made is the commercial bank. This is true even in countries with highly developed capital markets  especially when it is kept in mind that participants in the capital markets rely heavily on the banking system for their financing facilities. Banks cannot play an effective role in the financial intermediation process unless the public has the utmost confidence in the banking system. This confidence is a key reason why banking institutions and banking instruments are crucial to a country’s economic growth and development. The combination of functions typically provided by commercial banks  however  also carries with it the risk that a loss of confidence in an individual institution can spread to the system as a whole  the so-called systemic risk phenomenon. Instances in which a country experiences a loss of confidence in its financial institutions usually result in major damage to the economy. Given the indispensable role that financial institutions play in the success of a country’s economy  governments clearly have a responsibility to subject financial institutions to some form of regulation or oversight. But here again  there is need for balance. Restrictions placed on banks by the financial oversight apparatus cannot be allowed to discourage risk-taking per se  because risk-taking is an inherent part of banking and finance in market economies. To perform successfully  a commercial banking system requires a delicate balance between risk-taking and maintaining public confidence. Because of the importance and the difficulties inherent in the balancing act  banking systems are generally subject to a higher degree of official oversight and regulation than are most other forms of private enterprise  and supported by some form of a broad safety net. While the specifics can differ appreciably across countries  these safety nets are usually constructed along similar lines. They generally include oversight of the affairs of banking institutions in the form of inspection and examination of the institutions for compliance with a broad set of safety and soundness standards; some type of protection against losses for BIS Review 17/1997 - 5 - small depositors and investors; and some form of emergency liquidity facility for banking institutions and  occasionally  for other financial institutions as well. Finally  the payments system  a crucial link in any financial system  generally includes some form of official regulation of or participation in its operations. These important aspects of the safety net often feed into one or more of the functions performed by central banks. For this reason  the central bank usually plays a major role in the operation of one or more of these facets of the safety net. For example  the emergency liquidity facility is almost always the discount window of the central bank. In many countries -- including Ireland and the United States -- the central bank also plays an important role in the supervision of banking institutions and in the oversight of payments system operations. The important role played by the central bank in helping to build and maintain confidence in the underlying stability of the financial system in turn implies that there must be a high degree of public confidence in the central bank itself. This brings me back full circle: achieving and maintaining that public confidence depends first and foremost on the success of the central bank in discharging its monetary policy responsibilities. A sound economy and sound money are virtually synonymous  which is why monetary policy stands at the center of central bank functions. The importance of monetary policy is also the reason why central banks need special independent status within the governments they serve. In my view  it is particularly critical that the central bank not be directly responsible for financing government budget deficits; such a responsibility can  over time  compromise the financial integrity of the central bank  and thereby  public confidence in it. Note  however  that even without any involvement in direct financing of government budget deficits  central banks have a major stake in the development and maintenance of a smoothly-functioning government securities market  which can provide substantial benefits to the economy beyond those emanating from private sector financing of government budget deficits. In closing  I want to stress that the commitment to price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy in no way implies that the health of the economy or of the financial system should be sacrificed. On the contrary  what is important to bear in mind is that by ensuring a stable price and financial environment  the central bank helps foster economic growth. I believe that no central bank can maintain price stability over the longer term without public support for the necessary policies. Only with the confidence of the public in their policies and their own lasting dedication to non-inflationary growth together with a well-functioning financial system can central banks succeed in achieving and maintaining price and financial stability.

Patrikis  at the Queen Mary & Westfield College University of London & UNISYS International Management Centre held in Saint Paul de Vence  France from 22-24/1/97. A. Introduction I want to share with you today some observations and speculations gathered this and last year about banking and the Internet. I will be speaking in my capacity as a central banker -- which includes monetary policy  banking services  bank supervision  and payments system oversight -- and as a surfer of the ’Net. Let me state  at the outset  that  while the Federal Reserve Bank of New York does not conduct “Internet banking” as such  we do have a home page (http://www.ny.frb.org) with much useful information about our institution  with over three million recorded hits to date. Finally  let me add that some of what I say here today could  very easily  be obsolete in two months’ or even two weeks’ time. But I will try to point out those areas in advance. The title of this portion of the program gives rise to two issues of definition. The first is “What is the Internet?” The second is “What is banking?” As I am sure you are well aware  in the United States we are a litigious sort. We even have a legal definition of the Internet. According to one recent case  the “Internet” is “an international computer ’supernetwork’ of over 15 000 computer networks used by about 30 million individuals  corporations  organizations  and educational institutions worldwide.”1 Another case described the “Internet” as “a global communications network linked principally by modems which transmit electronic data over telephone lines [with] approximately 20 million to 30 million users.”2 “Banking” raises a host of issues in the United States. There is commercial banking and investment banking. The products offered by “banking” firms range from deposit taking (including payment services)  investment advisory and management services  trading in financial instruments  brokering and underwriting financial instruments  lending  and trust services. A bank can offer all of these services on the Internet. For the purposes of this discussion  I will basically confine myself to deposit taking (including payment services) and lending. A Central Banker’s View From a United States central bank perspective  the most fundamental question of banking and the Internet is: What are the monetary-policy implications  especially were we to assume the enormous  widespread scale that some have been predicting? From this perspective  the answer appears to be: probably not much. If the Internet is used merely to facilitate existing banking and payment transactions  such as executing electronic bill payments or transferring funds from one bank account to another (which more or less describes what electronic bill payment really is anyway)  the combination of banking and the Internet should have few  if any  implications for the conduct of United States monetary policy  or the measurement of the United States money supply. “Money ” as defined by M1  M2  or M3  would still be held in accounts at 1 2 judicial description of the Internet can be found in American Civil Liberties Union v. Reno  929 F. Supp. 824  830-48 (E.D.P.A. 1996). Panavision Int’l  L.P. v. Toeppen  938 F. Supp. 616  617 (C.D. Cal. 1996). In Systems  Inc. v. Instruction Set  Inc.  937 F. Supp. 161  164 (D. Conn. 1996). The most comprehensive BIS Review 17/1997 - 2 - banks that would be reported to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System through the existing mechanisms that such funds are reported today. If  however  Internet banking evolved to the point where digital “coins ” account-based cards and PCs  or other private-sector initiatives produced electronic representations of money that began to be used and circulated like currency  the potential implications for United States monetary policy are much greater. The key questions here are related to amount and velocity -- that is  (1) how would digital bills or notes  or digital coins  be represented on the books of a bank or depository institution; and (2) how many times would this electronic coin or bill circulate in the general economy without somehow being processed and recorded by a bank? In this regard  the October 1996 Bank for International Settlements report “Implications for Central Banks of the Development of Electronic Money” states “E-money could lead to shifts in the velocity of money which might temporarily reduce the usefulness of the monetary aggregates  especially narrower ones  for countries that rely on them as targets or indicators.” In a June 1996 speech before a cyber-payments conference  Governor Edward Kelley of the Board of Governors stated that  with respect to a bank’s liabilities incurred through issuing stored-value cards  such liabilities should be included in the statistical reports that banks must currently submit to the Board of Governors.3 It is difficult to argue that bank liabilities resulting from the issuance of electronic “coins” or electronic “bills and notes” should be reported any differently. A more problematic question arises when considering the matter of nonbank issuance of electronic coins or bills. Currently  the largest nonbank issuers of travelers checks are not required  but do volunteer to the Fed  the outstanding balances of their travelers checks  so that this information can be statistically recorded and reported in United States monetary aggregates by the Fed. If the issuance of private electronic money grows to a significant level in the real economy  and if much of that growth is provided by nonbank issuers of electronic money  there could be a similar request for nonbank issuers to provide information about the volume of their issuance and their outstanding electronic money liabilities  to the extent these liabilities are not recorded on the books of a bank every time they are circulated in the general economy. A Bank Supervisor’s View From this perspective  combining banking and the Internet offers both great opportunity and great potential risk. First  the good news -- it is primarily cost-related. It has been reported by several banking studies that the cost of a typical transaction at a bank branch is now over $1.00; the cost of an ATM transaction is approximately $0.25. The cost of an Internet transaction  however  has been estimated at about a penny. I do not vouch for this statistic  but the difference is substantial. Such figures make a compelling argument for banks to get on the Internet sooner rather than later  and to move as many of their customers on to electronic or Internet banking as soon as they possibly can. Indeed  some banks offer low-fee accounts where the customer is not expected to enter an office physically -- mail  phone  and ATM are sufficient. As stated by Board of Governors Chairman Alan Greenspan: “it is useful...to begin by reminding ourselves just why there is bank supervision and regulation. At bottom  of course  is the historical experience of the effects on the real economy of financial market 3 the Cyberpayments Conference ’96 (June 18  1996). Remarks of Edward W. Kelley  Jr.  Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at BIS Review 17/1997 - 3 - disruptions and bank failures  especially when the disruptions and failures spread beyond the initial impetus.”4 A bank supervisor should have concerns other than cost  and these comprise the bad news -- the “risk” aspect of banking on the Internet. In the simplest terms  while we strive to ensure that banks remain efficient and cost-effective  we also have to ensure that banks know what they are getting into  and that they are capable of handling the risks that accompany banking on the Internet. The tension between the two is very constant and real  particularly because the technology today seems to be moving so much faster than bankers or bank supervisors can fully absorb. At the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  we are being proactive in this area. We currently conduct on-site  information systems examinations of State member banks in our district -- in addition to commercial  trust  trading  and compliance examinations -- in which we try to review and constructively criticize the examined bank’s entire MIS infrastructure. There is no separate  independent electronic or Internet bank exam as such. However  a part of the information systems examination reviews the bank’s electronic and Internet activities and plans  and all examiners ask general questions that we feel that any bank offering on-line banking services should be able to answer responsively. In addition  we have convened a special task force at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to review security issues involving on-line and Internet banking. The goal of this task force is two-fold: (1) to gather  review  and benchmark current and future on-line security procedures and policies of State member banks in our district; and (2) to then somehow disseminate  without unduly disadvantaging any specific depository institution that provided us with its information  the best of these policies and procedures into a kind of “sound practices” security guide for banks to use for their electronic and Internet banking services. The task force should issue its first report in the summer of 1997. In a similar vein  I believe that the United States Federal bank supervisors  while mindful of the risks  have tried to be as supportive of electronic and Internet banking as possible. Each of the various bank supervisory agencies  i.e.  the Board of Governors  the Office of Thrift Supervision (“OTS”)  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)  and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”)  has dealt in some immediate way with the issues posed by electronic and Internet banking. Both the OTS and the Board of Governors have dealt directly with Internet banking through the bank applications approval process. In May of 1995  the OTS approved the application of a new thrift  the Security First Network Bank (“SFNB”)  that sought explicitly to provide the majority of its electronic banking services over the Internet.5 In May of 1996  the Board of Governors approved the application of SFNB’s parent  a bank holding company  for SFNB to acquire a data-processing firm specializing in data processing activities that would provide nationwide banking and financial services over the Internet.6 In December of 1996  the Board of Governors approved the application of a Minnesota bank holding company and two foreign banks to join a consortium of 15 North 4 Associations of Japan (Nov. 18  1996). Alan Greenspan  Banking in the Global Marketplace  address before the Federation of Bankers 5 See OTS Order No. 95-88 (May 8  1995). 6 See Cardinal Bancshares  Inc.  82 Fed. Res. Bull. 674 (1996). In this Board Order  the Board stated that “The Board believes the provision of computer banking services by SFNB to its customers in accordance with the authority granted by the OTS  and as specifically described in this proposal  is consistent with Cardinal’s existing authority under the [Bank Holding Company Act] and Regulation Y to operate a savings association.” Id. at n.1. BIS Review 17/1997 - 4 - American banks and IBM to form Integrion Financial Network  LLC.7 Integrion itself has announced that it will not provide electronic or home banking services  but will instead design and operate a secure electronic gateway or interface system linking bank customers to their depository institutions  including links via the Internet.8 Finally  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Board of Governors are currently processing an application from a foreign bank  with a United States securities brokerage subsidiary  to acquire a software firm planning to design software for customers of brokerage firms to place securities buy-and-sell orders over the Internet.9 The OCC  meanwhile  confirmed in correspondence in August of 1996 that  in addition to providing home banking services to its customers through the Internet  a national bank subsidiary could also provide Internet access to customers and nonbank customers in the bank’s service area.10 In the midst of all this supervisory “support ” however  I should also mention some of the as-yet unsettled issues dealing with the unique regulatory burdens facing depository institutions offering financial services over the Internet. Among the most difficult will be the proper application of the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”)  a United States statute that requires depository institutions to meet the credit needs of the communities where they accept deposits. What exactly is a deposit community in cyberspace? Nobody really knows. This has not yet become a significant issue because most depository institutions offering on-line services still have brick-and-mortar branches  on to which current definitions of a CRA community are based. Still  for exclusively on-line depository institutions  the CRA issue will become increasingly important as their market share grows. Some early discussions with the relevant compliance supervisors may be in order. I also note that this also raises interesting questions on the definition of the relevant geographic market in the analysis of bank mergers. Furthermore  considering the CRA issue brings forth another  broader issue: what is the role of nonbanks in the realm of Internet financial services  particularly payment services  which are still largely the province of banks and other regulated depository institutions? Because banks have been so intricately involved in the United States payments system  banks today face unique regulatory burdens: CRA  reserve requirements  deposit insurance premiums  and the costs of good supervision and good supervisors. If nonbanks begin to take significant market share away from banks because of an inherently lower cost structure  that raises real questions about a level playing field and whether or not banks can ever fairly compete. If nonbanks begin offering through the Internet many of the payment services  or alternatives to the payment services now offered exclusively by banks  that raises real concerns about the ultimate value of a bank charter  and what it really means to be a “bank.” Or is this “banking”? Another issue that may be relevant here is the implication of a firm that has a balance sheet that looks like that of a bank but does not have direct access to the lender-of-last resort. Finally  and especially in light of the issues just raised  I think it is important for me to emphasize that the bank supervisors have expressed a clear willingness to listen to what the banking community has had to say on the issues involving electronic and Internet banking. Regulation E  promulgated by the Board of Governors  implements the Electronic Funds Transfer Act of 1978  and establishes primarily for consumer protection purposes the basic 7 8 electronic link to one. 9 Toronto Dominion Bank (Dec. 19  1996). 10 See Royal Bank of Canada  et al.  83 Fed. Res. Bull. _____  (Order approved Dec. 2  1996). Integrion also stated that it will not function as an Internet service provider  but will provide a secure See Notification to the Board of Governors Regarding Investment in Marketware International Inc. of See OCC Interp. Letter No. 742 (Aug. 19  1996). BIS Review 17/1997 - 5 - rights  liabilities  and responsibilities of consumers who use  and financial institutions who offer  retail electronic funds transfer services.11 Among the protections provided are required disclosures  error resolution procedures  and loss protection. In 1996  when the Board of Governors issued its proposed regulations concerning the applicability of Regulation E to stored-value cards  the Board of Governors explicitly requested that commenters to the proposed revisions indicate whether the commenters believed that part or all of Regulation E should apply to electronic “money” or “value” residing on a computer system or a personal-computer hard drive.12 Similarly  the FDIC  while holding public hearings on its General Counsel Opinion No. 8 on stored-value cards and Federal deposit insurance coverage 13 specifically requested additional commentary on Federal deposit insurance coverage and electronic value represented on computer systems or personal computers. I believe the message is clear: as bank supervisors  we are open to what the banking community has to say on this rapidly evolving market. New ideas and reasoned arguments are welcome. We must try not to restrain important new services developed by the banking industry but should remain vigilant as banking-type services are offered by nonbank institutions. A Payments Systems Overseer’s View From the perspective of a payments system overseer  I see much activity  but thus far  few genuinely revolutionary innovations with respect to banking and the Internet in the United States. Mainly  I see the application of faster  cheaper electronic processing of older  more established paper-based methods of transferring payments between parties. Credit card payments on the Internet are one example. Instead of using a telephone  a normal card reader  and a customer’s signature  one leading Internet payments company has devised a secure method of allowing a bank customer to shop on-line with a credit card  by never releasing “in the clear” the customer’s credit card number on the Internet itself. Instead  the company only releases the credit card number and a merchant’s request for payment to the customer’s issuing bank  away from the Internet  after verifying on-line with the customer that the purchase was authentically made. The bank processes the transaction as it would any other credit card purchase; the value added by the company is that the customer’s credit card number is never on-line  a benefit indeed in today’s security-poor Internet. It is not hard to imagine that another step in this direction is for a third-party organization (perhaps even a bank subsidiary) to issue secure  encrypted electronic checks on the Internet on behalf of bank customers  or even unaffiliated parties  wishing to make purchases on-line. Much legal uncertainty remains in the United States about establishing such a process  however. Basic questions remain unanswered. What  exactly  would be an authorized signature on an electronic check? Put another way  what types of entities would be authorized to act as certification authorities on the Internet for such commercial conveniences as electronic purchase orders  electronic negotiable instruments  or their bases  digital signatures? Would these See 12 C.F.R. Part 205. I should note here that other consumer-protection regulations issued by the Board of Governors address 11 12 consumer credit transactions. 13 FDIC General Counsel Opinion No. 8 stated  in essence  that the FDIC would consider granting Federal deposit insurance coverage for electronic value residing on stored value cards issued by a bank  only if the value on the stored value card represented an obligation definitively linked to an existing bank customer’s deposit account. BIS Review 17/1997 - 6 - certification authorities be entirely private sector derived? Or would they be established and operated by the government  by the individual states  some of whom already have enacted digital signature statutes? What is the role of banks in this process? In particular  what are the risks to the bank  in allowing a nonaffiliated third party to act as a certifying authority for electronic checks drawn from the accounts of bank customers? I could ask some even more basic commercial law questions about banking in cyberspace. When is an Internet payment final? More specifically  when a payment over the Internet is made  has the maker of the payment made a provisional payment  as with writing a check  or a final payment  as with giving a certified check or making a wire transfer? Articles 3  4 and 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) govern the above circumstances  but have nothing to say on Internet payments. Currently  private contract law governs; agreements between each of the parties in an on-line transaction should be very carefully drafted and reviewed. Still  if Internet banking and commercial transactions were to grow in volume and complexity  it is quite possible that private contract law could evolve into a specialized commercial law of cyberspace  and eventually be codified into parts of the UCC. On a less theoretical note  I should mention that a multi-national Task Force on the Security of Electronic Money  established by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the Group of Computer Experts of the Group of Ten Central Bank Governors  and chaired by Israel Sendrovic of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  issued a report on its findings entitled “Security of Electronic Money” in August 1996. This Task Force examined primarily consumer-oriented stored-value payment products by  among other activities  surveying the leading global suppliers of both card-based and software-based stored-value systems  and concluded that the technical security measures of these systems are being designed to achieve an adequate level of security relative to other forms of common retail payment  assuming they are implemented appropriately. I recommend the report to anyone interested in a general discussion about security issues and stored-value systems  Internet-based or not. Moving away from consumer banking and the Internet  and looking perhaps not-so-distantly into the future  I have also had occasion to question what the repercussions are for large-value payments transfer systems  such as Fedwire  with the emergence of a different  much more secure Internet. Generally speaking  the Internet today is a “somewhat” secure environment in which to conduct banking and financial service activity. The current level of security is not adequate for large-value payments. Some Internet-based payment products are becoming more secure  but only after the creators of these products have spent a great deal of time  effort and resources making their products secure. Consistent fast transmission and processing are also essential for large-value payments. The Internet today has no authorized  universal means of prioritizing specific electronic messages from other messages. Faster and better hardware helps  certainly  but offers no guarantee. One of my responsibilities is to serve as the Product Director of the Wholesale Payments Product Office of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks. This includes the Fedwire transfer of funds  transfers of securities against payment  and net settlement. In providing these payment services  the Reserve Banks must charge a fee designed to cover their costs  plus what we refer to as a “private sector adjustment factor ” a proxy for the capital  taxes  and other costs incurred by private-sector service providers. Thus  I am keenly interested in the next stage of the Internet. If messages sent across the Internet could be made timely  become much more secure at reasonable cost  and  if a widely-accepted prioritization scheme for electronic messages BIS Review 17/1997 - 7 - could be implemented so that large-value payment messages could move instantaneously  it is not inconceivable that the effect on existing large-value payments transfer systems could be substantial. Within a five-to-ten year time frame  I could see at least a portion of Fedwire large-volume transfers of funds and securities -- with real-time gross-settlement -- handled over the Internet. Please do not ask me exactly when this will come about. On the other hand  with potentially enormous  secure  bilateral netting arrangements occurring between clearing banks in real time over the Internet  volume on existing large-value transfer systems could decrease dramatically. The clearing banks could  conceivably  save themselves some real money. Jurisdictional Issues Any discussion of banking or any form of commerce over the Internet today would not be complete without at least a few words on the legal jurisdictional issues that the Internet presents. This is arguably the area of law most in flux  the most subject to change on a monthly or even daily basis  depending on the specific jurisdiction and long-arm statute under discussion. In the United States  cases have already been decided regarding court jurisdiction and the Internet over alleged trademark violations 14 contract disputes 15 and advertising disputes.16 Although I am as yet unaware of any banking organizations that have become embroiled in litigation over jurisdictional issues from being on the Internet  I cannot promise you that such a suit will never occur. If a State banking agency or a State attorney general decided one day that a Web-site or an Internet-based transaction conferred sufficient minimum contacts with a state resident so that the state’s long-arm statute applied to the bank  a suit could easily be filed. Minnesota Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III filed six lawsuits in 1995 against six companies accusing them of engaging in illegal business practices or running outright pyramid schemes over the Internet  although none of the six companies was based in Minnesota  and no Minnesota citizen ever came forward to complain about the companies. The fact that a Minnesota resident could have accessed the scams run by the companies  claimed Attorney General Humphrey  was sufficient to confer jurisdiction of his lawsuits in the Minnesota courts. Lest this argument sound wildly and improbably expansive  it should be noted that the “Internet access = jurisdiction” idea has already been accepted by some of the Federal district courts that have decided such cases  although it must also be noted that these courts’ decisions have been inconsistent  have all had slightly different facts  and have taken great pains to distinguish themselves from one another. New case law on the issue of jurisdiction conferred by Internet access is undoubtedly being made as we speak. At a minimum  then  banks offering services through the Internet should have signed contracts with electronic and Internet banking customers that specify to the courts where claims or disputes may be brought. Web-sites designed merely to advertise a bank’s financial services should be designed to be as controversy-free as possible  although that may be difficult without making the sites content-free as well. Banks should err on the side of caution until the jurisdictional issues have had more time to sort themselves out. I would like to present a hypothetical fact situation to you which I think demonstrates some of the thorny legal and supervisory issues that could be raised by the existence of offshore banking entities doing business over the Internet with individuals in our 14 See Panavision Int’l  L.P. v. Toeppen  938 F. Supp. 616  (C.D. Cal. 1996) ; Bensusan Restaurant Corp. v. King  937 F. Supp. 295 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) ; Playboy Enterprises  Inc. v. Chuckleberry Publishing  Inc.  939 F.

BIS Review 17/1997 - 8 - jurisdictions. I travel to the island of Atlantis  where I obtain a Class Z banking charter. I am permitted under this charter to engage in the business of banking every place in the world  except with residents of Atlantis. As you have probably suspected  Atlantis is founded on the principle of free and open markets  unfettered by supervision and regulation of banks with Class Z charters. Atlantis also provides for strict adherence of the principles of banking secrecy. My bank is named The Internet International Bank (“IIB”). The IIB offers a full spectrum of banking services to Atlantis nonresidents. Being a modern bank  it conducts business principally on the Internet. IIB has a series of quite attractive Internet pages where its products are offered. These pages spell out the products  deposit terms and interest rates  and loan terms and interest rates. All agreements are governed by the law of Atlantis. All deposits are deemed received over IIB’s “counters” in Atlantis  and all loans are paid out of Atlantis. Atlantis has an enjoyable ambiance even exceeding that of Nice and Saint Paul de Vence; therefore  I see no need to leave the island. I do receive and entertain customers when they visit Atlantis. I do place telephone calls to customers who have responded to my Internet page  but I do not make cold calls to customers. Communications with customers over the Internet are state-of-the-art secure. Customers receive account statements over the Internet  issue payment instruments to IIB over the Internet  and request loans over the Internet. All payments to and from accounts are made by wire transfer to IIB’s correspondent account maintained on the books of Atlantis Bank  the only bank chartered under Atlantis law authorized to engage in banking transactions with Atlantis residents. Customers may instruct IIB to make payments for their account. These too are consummated by means of payments out of IIB’s account at Atlantis Bank. Loans are disbursed and paid the same way. The question presented is whether IIB is violating the law of the countries in which its customers are located. While I have my own views as to the application of United States banking and securities laws to this fact situation  I prefer not to spell those out in my prepared remarks. Instead  we all might prosper by sharing our views as to the proper application of our home country’s laws to individuals in our countries who might do business with IIB. I should note that this fact situation is a pure figment of my imagination. The cooperative efforts of bank supervisors over the world should be designed to ensure precisely against this sort of bank. In other words  like Atlantis  IIB should never surface above water. Our discussion should include responses to the following questions: (1) is IIB engaged in an impermissible activity in your home country; (2) if it is impermissible  what authority has responsibility for enforcing that law; (3) if impermissible  is that a civil or criminal violation; (4) if impermissible  is there any way for IIB to qualify to do business in your home country; and finally  (5) does your home-country court have jurisdiction to hear cases brought by a customer against IIB? Conclusion To conclude  I simply wish to commend the banking and legal communities for learning as much about electronic and Internet banking as they can  now  and for trying to stay ahead of the curve of ever evolving and improving technology. I fully agree with the philosophy of letting the markets decide what will work and what will not. We  as supervisor and central banker  will try to stay out of the way as much as possible  unless because of criminal activities or systemic risk concerns we have to jump in. The private sector seems to have done fairly well so far. To this end  I point out a recent creation of the Banker’s Roundtable  an organization composed of some of the largest United States banks  in organizing the Banking Industry Technology Secretariat (“BITS”). BIS Review 17/1997 - 9 - BITS  as I understand it  is in the process of designing and implementing common technological standards for the inter-operability of systems linking banks and their customers  and is also hoping to act as a certification authority for its member banks for third-party system and software providers  to ensure that when an electronic or Internet banking transaction takes place  the bank’s name is the only name the customer ever sees. Similarly  a certified software or systems provider would agree that the customer’s payment information would stay with the bank and not the provider. I mention this not as an endorsement of BITS  but as an example of the type of innovation and cooperative or collaborative effort that can occur when the banking community realizes the enormous challenge and opportunity it has in the next few years. Central banks and bank supervisors must also be equal to these challenges. In order for us to fulfill our responsibilities  it will be necessary for the private sector financial institutions to keep educating and challenging us. It is those dynamics that will help ensure good public policy in banking supervision and regulation of banking transactions over the Internet. BIS Review 17/1997
r970228a,1997-02-28,https://www.bis.org/review/r970228a.pdf,Bank of Japan's February review of monetary and economic trends in Japan (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  18 Feb 97),BANK OF JAPAN  MONTHLY ECONOMIC REVIEW  18/2/97.,Bank of Japan’s February review of monetary and economic trends in Japan BANK OF JAPAN  MONTHLY ECONOMIC REVIEW  18/2/97. A moderate economic recovery continues in Japan as private demand shows increasing firmness. With respect to final demand  public-sector investment has decreased while net exports are on an increasing trend. Housing investment has remained at a high level and business fixed investment is increasing steadily. While growth in personal consumption has been moderate on the whole  passenger car sales  which have a strong influence on production  have accelerated significantly. Meanwhile  inventories on the whole are at appropriate levels. In these circumstances  industrial production has recently increased at a somewhat fast pace and labor market conditions have continued to improve moderately. Meanwhile  prices have stopped declining  and monetary aggregates continue to grow at 3.0 - 4.0 per cent. With regard to personal consumption  sales at department stores and supermarkets are improving moderately  albeit with some fluctuations. Outlays for travel have remained firm. Growth in sales of electrical appliances has become somewhat moderate as the pace of expansion in personal computers and cellular telephones decelerated. Passenger car sales have recorded buoyant two-digit growth year-to-year for four consecutive months since October 1996. Among leading indicators of business fixed investment  machinery orders are increasing steadily on average  although they are expected to show a decline in the first quarter of 1997 as a reaction to the large increase recorded in the fourth quarter of 1996 in both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors. Construction floor area has also continued to pick up moderately. With respect to housing investment  housing starts have remained strong reflecting low interest rates and reasonable housing prices. They recorded a high seasonally-adjusted annual rate of over 1.7 million starts in the fourth quarter of 1996  partly reflecting the rise in orders ahead of the consumption tax rate hike. Regarding public-sector showing developments in orders have decreased significantly since autumn 1996 compared to the high level recorded in the previous year which reflected the large economic stimulus package. As for actual implementation of public works  with a time lag after orders  the seasonally adjusted level of shipments of related goods has been decreasing since autumn 1996 after having increased until the summer. investment  public works contracted Real exports have recently shown an increasing trend as the effects of the yen’s depreciation since summer 1995 have gradually permeated. Meanwhile  the increase in real imports has slowed  also reflecting the depreciation of the yen. As a result  the real trade surplus turned to an increase in autumn 1996. The nominal current account surplus is also beginning to rise  although the pace of increase is slower than that of the real trade surplus  partly because the rise in oil prices is pushing up import volume. Industrial production has increased significantly by an annual rate of over 10 per cent quarter-to-quarter in the fourth quarter of 1996. This increase was caused by the rise in final demand  particularly in demand conducive to production  such as passenger car sales  machinery orders  and net exports  in addition to the completion of inventory adjustments. Industrial production is expected to continue increasing significantly in January and February 1997  reflecting the rise in demand ahead of the consumption tax rate hike. BIS Review 20/1997 - 2 - Labor market conditions have continued to improve moderately on the whole. Although the unemployment rate remains at a high level and employment growth has been moderate  overtime working hours have significantly exceeded the level of the previous year in line with production growth  and the ratio of job offers to job applications has continued its rise. With respect to price developments  domestic wholesale prices (adjusted for seasonal electricity rates) have stopped declining  although downward pressures such as from competition with imports and technological innovation in  e.g.  electrical machinery  remain strong. This development has been supported by the yen’s depreciation to date  the rise in crude oil prices and the moderate improvement in domestic supply and demand conditions. Corporate service prices have declined  particularly in rents and leasing charges  but the year-to-year decrease has become smaller. Consumer prices (nationwide  excluding perishables) have exceeded the level of the previous year  as the decline in commodity prices has slowed against the background of the yen’ depreciation and the halt in the decline in domestic wholesale prices. Growth in monetary aggregates  measured in terms of the year-to-year growth rate of M2 + CDs average outstanding  has remained stable on the whole at 3.0 - 4.0 per cent. Although lending by private financial institutions has been weak  that by public financial institutions has been firm. Regarding money market rates  the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) on the whole has stayed somewhat below the official discount rate of 0.5 per cent. The 3-month CD rate has moved at 0.50 - 0.55 per cent. Meanwhile  with regard to the market ’s interest rate expectations  3-month Euro-yen futures are showing relatively minor movements after declining at a brisk pace between summer and autumn 1996. In these circumstances  the long-term government bond yield had been declining since summer 1996  and has recently moved at around 2.4 per cent. With respect to bank lending rates  the short-term prime lending rate has remained at a record low level of 1.625 per cent since September 1995. The long-term prime lending rate was lowered three times by a total of 0.8 percentage points since September 1996 in response to the developments in the long-term interest rates  and has been moving at the record low of 2.5 per cent since December. In these circumstances  short-term and long-term average contracted interest rates on new loans and discounts have moved at around record low levels. On the stock exchange  the Nikkei 225 stock average plummeted between the end of 1996 and early 1997 reflecting market’s uncertainties about Japan’s economic outlook and balance-sheet problems. It became stable in late January 1997 and has recently stayed around ¥18 000 - 19 000. In the foreign exchange market  the yen depreciated moderately on the whole against the U.S. dollar in 1996  but the pace of depreciation has accelerated since the end of 1996. The yen has recently moved at around ¥123 - 124 to the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile  the yen has been relatively stable against the deutsche mark at around ¥73 - 74. BIS Review 20/1997

Macfarlane  to The Sydney Institute on 11/2/97. 1. Introduction It is a great pleasure to be speaking at The Sydney Institute  which has done so much over recent years to keep alive informed discussion of public affairs and the arts. In keeping with this tradition  I have chosen to speak on a subject with a historical  economic and political theme. I would like to look back at the 1950s and 1960s  and evaluate some of the lessons that people take from this period. The further my professional life proceeds  the more value I see in a good knowledge of economic history  even if it is so recent that most of us have lived and worked through it. As you will gather  my views on history are much closer to George Santayana’s than to Henry Ford’s. There can be no quibble with the proposition that macro-economic performance in the immediate post-war period  which for present purposes I will refer to as the 1950s and 1960s  was far superior to any period before or after. This has led a lot of people to use it as a basis for proposing economic policies for today. They look back at how things were done in the 1950s and 1960s  and say “if only we did it the same way today  our macro-economic performance would be as good as it was then”. This approach has some merit but  if we are to use it  it is very important that we get our facts straight about what the policies actually were in the 1950s and 1960s. There are two propositions of policy relevance that are frequently made about this period. The first one is that the macro-economic success at that time was due to the use of activist and expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. The second is that the world economy was moving along very smoothly in the post-war period  with everything under control  until hit by the external shock of the OPEC-induced oil price rise in late 1973 (and again in 1979). I would like to analyse these two propositions with particular reference to Australia  but in doing so it will be necessary to bring in a lot of international economic and political events  particularly those occurring in the United States. 2. Macro-economic performance in the 1950s and 1960s It is not necessary to spend much time demonstrating how successful this period was in terms of macro-economic performance because no-one disputes it. Table 1 shows that the real growth rate for the world economy was more than twice as high in the 1950-1973 period than in the previous 80 years. In Australia there was also a major improvement  although less than a doubling. Inflation  which had been negligible on average until the Second World War  rose to about 4 per cent in the 1950-1973 period  with the average being pushed up by the Korean War period and the early 1970s. At other times it was a good deal lower  and even with these periods included  it was moderate enough to permit economic expansion for most of the period. Unemployment remained low throughout the period  although there was some cyclical movement at times. Overall  macro-economic performance was considerably better in this period than in any time before or since  which has prompted economic historians such as Maddison (1991) to refer to this period as the “Golden Age”. BIS Review 20/1997 - 2 - Indicators of World(a) and Australian(b) Macro-economic Performance Table 1: (average annual increase) 1870-1950 1950-1973 1973-1980 GDP 2.3 (2.9) 4.9 (4.7) 2.6 (3.1) CPI 0.1(c) (1.3) 4.1 (4.6) 7.3 (9.7) (a) Sixteen largest OECD countries; (b) Australian figures in brackets; (c) Peacetime years. Source: Maddison (1991). There were a number of factors behind this impressive economic performance  but time and space limit me to mentioning only the main ones. The four most important  I believe  are as follows: (i) There was a big gap to be made up following the Depression and the Second World War. The 1950s and 1960s was a period of post-war reconstruction or “catch-up” for most countries. The largest growth pick-up occurred in the countries most devastated by the war  such as Germany  Italy  Japan and Austria  and the least pronounced (although still significant) were in the United States  Canada  Switzerland  Sweden and Australia. (ii) Although populations and governments were eager for economic growth  there was widespread restraint in economic behaviour. The privations endured during the Depression and the War meant that as incomes rose  a high proportion was saved. Inflationary expectations too had been conditioned by decades of nearly zero inflation  which showed up in modest pricing and wage setting behaviour for much of the period. Some commentators also stress the political cohesion among western countries as a result of the ever-present influence of the Cold War. (iii) International trade was liberalised and exports and imports grew rapidly. This was a sharp contrast with the inter-war period. Maddison says “perhaps the least controversial assertion one can make about the Golden Age is that it involved a remarkable revival of liberalism in international transactions. Trade and payment barriers erected in the 1930s and during the War were removed. The new-style liberalism was buttressed by effective arrangements for regular consultation between Western Countries and for mutual financial assistance” (IMF  OECD and GATT (now WTO).) (iv) Governments conducted good macro-economic policies with a greater emphasis on economic growth than in previous decades. In a number of countries the new-found commitment to growth and low unemployment was enshrined in legislation. In others it was less formal  but in nearly every country the first decades after the Second World War were characterised by well-balanced and successful macro-economic policies. A more detailed examination of these macro-economic policies  particularly in Australia  is the subject of my next section. BIS Review 20/1997 3. The role of macro-economic policies - 3 - There is no doubt that the dominant principle behind macro-economic policy changed after the Second World War in line with Keynesian teaching  but the change occurred more quickly in some countries than others. The main change was that fiscal policy was to be used actively to promote economic growth by deliberately incurring budget deficits at times of weak economic activity. Fiscal policy and monetary policy together were termed demand management policy  and they were to be adjusted to smooth the business cycle  to increase growth and to achieve full employment. In Australia’s case  this approach was enshrined in a document - the 1945 White Paper  “Full Employment in Australia”. This approach to policy was very successful in that it achieved its aims of high growth rates and low unemployment for several decades  and it did so with generally low rates of inflation. The achievement was all the greater  given that the 1950s contained a major shock in the form of the Korean War commodity price boom. This high level of success has led many people to assume that policy must have been operated with a high degree of activism  i.e. by choosing very expansionary settings of policy. But this was not the case. For most of the period we are considering  demand management policy was quite restrained and  where necessary  restrictive. Certainly its guiding principle was Keynesian  but it was operated in a very balanced way and was  in any case  subject to an important constraint  which I will come to later. That this was the case should not be a surprise to people who remember the period. For example  the Fadden “Horror Budget” of 1951/52 and the “Credit Squeeze” of 1961  which nearly cost the Menzies Government office  have gone into folklore. Of course  there were also periods where policy was expansionary  but on average the result was relatively balanced. While growth was high  on average  there was also a business cycle operating during this period  with a couple of reasonably clearly defined recessions and booms. The fact that policy was well balanced can be shown for fiscal policy by a couple of graphs. Unfortunately  comparable data do not go back earlier than 1961/62  so we will have to lose the 1950s from our comparisons. Diagram 1 shows the best general measure of the underlying budget deficit. In the 12 years from 1961/62 to 1973/74 the budget was  on average  1.5 0.0 -1.5 -3.0 -4.5 -6.0 Diagram 1 Budget Balance* Per cent of GDP Average 1961/62 to 1973/74 Average 1974/75 to 1995/96 1.5 0.0 -1.5 -3.0 -4.5 65/66 70/71 75/76 80/81 85/86 90/91 -6.0 95/96 * General government on an underlying basis. BIS Review 20/1997 - 4 - in surplus to the extent of ½ per cent of GDP  and the fluctuations around the average were not very large. In the period since then  the budget has nearly always been in deficit  with an average deficit of nearly 2 per cent of GDP. You can see the three attempts made to bring it back towards surplus - the first one when Mr. Howard was Treasurer  the second one under Mr. Keating as Treasurer  and the third one which is being continued at the moment by Mr. Costello. In summary  it is the more recent period that could be characterised as activist and expansionary in that there are bigger swings in the budgetary position and  on average  it tends to show a much bigger deficit. Diagram 2 General Government Outlays Per cent of GDP Average 1961/62 to 1973/74 Average 1974/75 to 1995/96 36 32 28 24 65/66 70/71 75/76 80/81 85/86 90/91 0 95/96 36 32 28 24 0 Another measure of fiscal activism is the size of government expenditure relative to the economy. It will come as no surprise to see that general government outlays relative to GDP were much lower in the 1960s than they are now (Diagram 2); in the earlier period they accounted for about 25 per cent of GDP  but over the last two decades they have averaged 34 per cent of GDP. The stance of monetary policy is more difficult to analyse because interest rates cannot be used as the measure of comparison. This is because before the early 1980s the financial system was heavily regulated  with the Government imposing interest rate ceilings on most forms of lending. Tightenings and easings in monetary policy showed up largely through credit rationing - the ease or difficulty in obtaining a loan at a given interest rate. This would be familiar to people who can remember the difficulty of obtaining a housing mortgage at that time. The best way of judging whether monetary policy was tight or loose in such a system was to see how fast it allowed money and credit to grow. The growth of the money supply is shown in Diagram 3  and again we see relatively low and stable expansion during the 1950s and 1960s (except for the Korean War boom)  before the turmoil starts in the 1970s (in this case  the very early 1970s). I referred earlier to the fact that monetary and fiscal policy had to operate under an important constraint during the 1950s and 1960s. The constraint to which I am referring is the gold exchange standard  whereby virtually all OECD countries fixed their exchange rate to the US dollar  which in turn fixed to gold. In Australia’s case  our exchange rate to the US dollar did not change between 1949 and 1971. This was in a way the centrepiece of our economic policy. BIS Review 20/1997 - 5 - Monetary policy and fiscal policy could not get too expansionary without either inflation or the balance of payments threatening the exchange rate. This mechanism effectively meant that our macro-economic policies (and those of most OECD economies) could not get too far out of line with the policies pursued by the US Government. A recognition of this link means that if we wish to fully understand what happened in the 1950s  1960s and early 1970s  we have to look more closely at the trends in US economic policy. This also means that we will have to stop looking at the 1950s  1960s and early 1970s as a whole  and instead divide it into two quite different sub-periods.

The end of the Golden Age The role of the United States is crucial here. Despite its having enacted the Employment Act of 1946  the United States continued to run reasonably conservative demand management policies through the Truman and Eisenhower years and even in the early part of the Kennedy Presidency. In this period US economic policy came in for a fair bit of criticism from economists  particularly outside the United States  for being too cautious. There was some basis to this criticism in that US policy makers did seem to be less keen to expand than their counterparts in other countries  particularly in Europe. American attitudes changed in the early 1960s  but nothing concrete occurred until the Johnson years. The turning point was the tax cuts introduced in 1964 and 1965 which were described by one of their architects - Arthur Okun - as “The largest stimulative fiscal action ever undertaken by the federal government in peacetime ... the first major stimulative measure adopted in the post-war era at a time when the economy was neither in  nor threatened imminently by  recession. And  unlike earlier tax reductions  they were taken in a budgetary situation marked by the twin facts that the federal budget was in deficit and federal expenditures were rising.” This certainly got the United States moving and was soon followed by increased defence expenditure occasioned by the Vietnam War  and other government expenditure associated with the Great Society programs. Some of the proponents of the original tax cuts then argued for tax increases but  not surprisingly  they found these were harder to put into place than were the earlier tax cuts. BIS Review 20/1997 - 6 - In the second half of the 1960s and early 1970s the US economy grew very quickly and inflation began to rise. For a time it was held in check by the Fed’s willingness to run a tight monetary policy  but with the appointment of Arthur Burns as Fed Chairman  monetary policy became more accommodating. President Nixon found that expansionary policies were popular  and continued in the same vein as his predecessor. By 1971  with the United States running a large current account deficit  it could no longer hold its commitment to gold and the US dollar was effectively devalued against gold and against other major currencies.

BIS Review 20/1997 - 7 - There was now no longer an anchor to the international financial system. Thus  the post-war period should really be divided into two sub-periods  with the US tax cuts of 1965 marking a convenient dividing line. Thereafter  US policy became expansionary  and it ceased to provide a constraint on the actions of other countries. It is instructive to see what happened in a range of countries during this second period  that is between the turning point in US policy in 1965 and the OPEC shock at the end of 1973. The story is very similar for all OECD countries. Their economies continued to grow strongly  but they were not able to get their unemployment any lower than the already low starting point (see Table 2).The main effect of these expansionary policies was to push inflation to levels that were not consistent with sustainable economic growth. As a general rule  most countries’ unemployment rates rose slightly  but their inflation rates doubled (see Table 3). By 1972 and 1973 the world economy was in an inflationary boom. How did Australia fare in this period? Our story was very similar to the general pattern  although the deterioration in inflation was more marked here. Our inflation rate  which had been about 4 per cent in the mid-1960s  reached 10.4 per cent in the year to the September quarter of 1973. That means that we had already got our inflation rate into double digits before OPEC came along to deliver a further inflationary impulse (see Diagram 4). Our problems were compounded by the inflationary boom that the world found itself in 1972 and 1973. Commodity prices were rising rapidly  as were our export receipts. With the monetary policy instruments then available  and with the fixed exchange rate  it was not possible to quarantine the monetary effects  and the money supply was soon growing at more than 20 per cent per annum. We did not help ourselves very much either with the way we set wages. The National Wage Case of December 1970 resulted in a 6 per cent increase in awards  and the metals industry award of July 1971 added 9 per cent to award wages through that year (when inflation was 5.1 per cent). Diagram 4 Consumer Prices Year-ended percentage change 9 6 3 0 9 6 3 Sep 65 Sep 66 Sep 67 Sep 68 Sep 69 Sep 70 Sep 71 Sep 72 0 Sep 73 The point of all this analysis is to answer the second proposition that was presented in the Introduction. Was the world achieving good macro-economic performance until hit by the OPEC shocks? The answer is clearly no. In the period after 1965  policies became too ambitious and too expansionary. In colloquial terms  we all lost the plot. Of course  it is easy for BIS Review 20/1997 - 8 - me to say these things now because I have the benefit of hindsight - it was much harder at the time to see that we were overstretching ourselves. By 1973  the world economy already had an entrenched inflationary problem  not just a temporary one as in the Korean War period. Whether OPEC had come along or not  it would still have been necessary to re-examine demand management policies and do something about restoring the sort of conditions that existed in the 1945-65 period. History shows that what we got instead was an oil price shock to add to our already considerable self-imposed troubles  and so spent the next decade-and-a-half trying to return to some sort of reasonable equilibrium. I do not want to say anything about that period because that is another story. 5. Conclusion The period that is loosely described as the 1950s and 1960s really covers the nearly three decades between the end of the Second World War and the first oil price shock known as OPEC I. Macro-economic policies were successful for most of this time in that they avoided the deflation that had characterised the 1930s  and yet did not move too far in the inflationary direction. However  a closer examination of the whole period suggests that there were two quite distinct sub-periods. The first  from 1945 to 1965 or thereabouts  was the true Golden Age in that sustainable growth with low inflation was achieved against a background of macro- economic policies that did not try to be too ambitious in the short run. The second period  from 1965 to 1973  looked promising for a time  but was ultimately a period of policy failure. Macro- economic policy tried to achieve too much and forgot about the need for sustainability. It ended up with the world economy in an inflationary boom  which set the scene for oil prices to rise sharply  as had all other commodity prices during the boom. A policy reversal aimed at restoring the more balanced approach of the 1945-65 period would have been needed even without the shock of OPEC.

George  at the Euromoney International Bond Congress held in London on 25/2/97.,Mr. George conveys his reflections on the development of bond market yields over recent years Remarks by the Governor of the Bank of England  Mr. E.A.J. George  at the Euromoney International Bond Congress held in London on 25/2/97. I’m honoured to have been invited to open this 3rd Euromoney International Bond Congress. I remember with great pleasure launching your initial Congress in October 1994 in the Barbican. It is an even greater pleasure now to launch the QEII! That first Congress was an ambitious and imaginative venture. But it immediately established itself as a major event in the international financial calendar. I congratulate Euromoney on that achievement  and  to judge from the program  on organising an even bigger and better Congress on this third occasion. I am delighted to welcome you all here. I remember our debate at that first Congress particularly well  Mr. Chairman. I remember it because I looked up my notes over the weekend! The context then was one in which yields had fallen very sharply  to unusually low levels  almost everywhere during 1993 only to back up just as sharply during 1994. We concluded  I think  that none of us really understood either the earlier strength of the market or its subsequent weakness! But we had a very enjoyable two days of discussion. One concern at the time was that we were facing a global capital shortage  with increasing demand from the emerging  transitioning and developing countries at a time of strengthening economic activity and large government deficits across the industrial world. Referring generally in my remarks this morning to 10 year maturities  real yields - measured by our own indexed gilts - had indeed risen in 1994 by ¾% or more to close to 4%. But nominal yields had risen by substantially more - by something like 2% in the major markets - reflecting increased uncertainty no doubt  but clearly also worsening inflationary expectations. In my remarks on that occasion  I ventured to suggest that bond markets might just be exaggerating at least the inflationary risks  by underestimating three factors in particular: First  the commitment of governments and central banks all around the world to disciplined macro-economic policies. Secondly  the restraining effect of both the level of real yields and of structural unemployment particularly in Europe. And thirdly  the counter-inflationary effect of global competition and technological innovation. Now I seem to recollect that this suggestion was met with a degree of scepticism. That was not at all surprising. You had all heard that sort of optimism from the authorities before! But the fact is that since around the time of that first Euromoney Congress bond yields have nevertheless trended fairly consistently lower  and are now in many cases close to or even below the low point they had reached around the end of 1993. Real yields  again measured by our own indexed gilts have fallen back to a little more than 3¼%; and the first US indexed bond issue yields much the same. And nominal yields have fallen by 200 basis points or more in continental Europe and Japan - though rather less in the United States and the UK. There has been more excitement in the foreign exchange market  with the dollar in particular first weakening against the yen and the major continental currencies until the spring of 1995 and then progressively recovering. BIS Review 22/1997 - 2 - These developments were certainly influenced by the factors which I mentioned a moment ago. In particular they have been influenced by the continuing broadly-based consensus - in countries all around the world  and across a large part of the political spectrum within countries - on the importance of macro-economic policy discipline. Macro-economic policy is no longer seen as an instrument for short-term demand management  which can be used to trade-off the conflicting demands of growth and stability in the short run. It is now much more widely understood and accepted that the rate of growth that can be sustained  or the level of employment that can be achieved and maintained in anything other than the short run  depend fundamentally on the structural  supply-side  characteristics of the economy  and not just on the level of demand. So today’s orthodoxy ascribes to macro-economic policy the job of keeping demand in line with the capacity of the economy to meet that demand in the medium and longer term. Within this overall framework  monetary policy is allocated the specific task of achieving and maintaining effective price stability. This is not  as some commentators still seem to suggest  simply some doctrinaire end in itself. Inflation is seen rather as a symptom of imbalance between demand and supply in the economy. So what we are essentially aiming to do through monetary policy is to anticipate the emergence of that imbalance and head it off before it becomes entrenched. If we are successful in that  inflation will be lower  there will be less need for violent interest rate movements than in the past  and the economy will grow at a steadier  and more sustainable and predictable  rate. That  in turn  will encourage more rational  longer-term  economic decision-making and investment  which will help indirectly to improve underlying  supply-side  performance. Similarly  today’s macro-economic orthodoxy requires fiscal policy to be directed to restricting government borrowing to levels that can be sustained into the medium and longer term  without either forcing up real yields or implying the prospective need for progressively rising tax rates - which could otherwise damage the development of private sector economic activity. Now in some respects we have made considerable progress over the past two years and more. Inflation in many countries - including virtually all the industrial countries but not confined to them - is now consistently lower than it has been for ages. That in itself has contributed to lower interest rates and to the lower nominal bond yields that I have described. But  in addition to that  fiscal consolidation  which has lowered the combined government deficits of the G7 countries from around $600 billion in 1994 to around $540 billion last year  has helped to reduce real yields  notwithstanding the continuing demand for capital from the developing world. And the really good news is that this macro-economic discipline has been accompanied by sustained economic expansion  with world GDP as a whole growing at an annual rate of some 3½ - 4%. Now of course there have been quite marked differences in the performance of individual countries within this overall picture. Some of the transition economies have seen a brutal contraction of output which is only now beginning to stabilise. And there have been marked fluctuations in the growth rates of some of the emerging countries. Growth in parts of Asia  for example  is now moderating  cyclically  to a more sustainable pace  while parts of Latin America continue to recover from the set-back they suffered two years ago. Among the industrial countries  too  economic developments have diverged over the past two years. In the United States and in this country  for example  inflation has been BIS Review 22/1997 - 3 - contained to around 3% with continuing growth and low or falling unemployment. And this pattern looks set to continue. In Japan and on the Continent of Europe  on the other hand  while inflation has been even lower  activity has been disappointingly weak  and unemployment on the Continent at least has risen to quite frightening levels. And while there is now the prospect of a moderate pick-up in activity in these countries  that is not yet assured. Japan  which is in many respects a unique case  faces substantial fiscal consolidation. And in Europe  too  the prospects are clouded by pressure to bring budget deficits down sufficiently to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria this year  notwithstanding the weakness of the domestic economies  and in an environment of longer term structural inflexibility. These divergent developments go a long way towards explaining recent differences in the behaviour of both bond markets and exchange rates. In both the United States and the United Kingdom the sustained expansion of domestic demand and of ouput has generated market expectations of an essentially cyclical rise in short-term interest rates. Sluggish economic activity elsewhere  on the other hand  means not only that short-term interest rates are significantly lower in Japan and the core European countries; but it also means that they are thought  by the market  to be less immediately likely to rise. This cyclical difference in the short-term interest rate prospect largely explains the pronounced yield differential between the US and the UK and the other countries at the very short end of the curve. Out to 2 years  for example  whereas yields in the US and UK are within ½% either side of 6%  yields in Germany and France are below 3½%  and they are below ½% in Japan. These differences in the short-term interest rate prospects feed through into yield differentials on longer term bonds  and changes in them also help to explain the recent movements in exchange rates. But rather more interesting is the relative slopes of the yield curves further ahead  US and UK yields are only about 1% above present short-term yields  at +/-7%; but they are 3% or more above present short term yields in Germany and France  also at +/-7%; and they are 3% higher than short-term yields even in Japan  at 3¾%. The implication is that  if you abstract from immediate cyclical influences  longer-term economic performance - and particularly performance with respect to inflation - is not expected to be very different between the major countries  though Japan remains an outlier. It is difficult to know what interpretation to put on this observation. The fact that the yield curves in Germany and France are practically identical is consistent at least with EMU going ahead - at least with a narrow membership. But the steep rise in implied future yields five years ahead suggests that inflation is expected to be higher in the medium term. That could be associated with expectations of softer macro-economic discipline  perhaps more specifically reflecting market uncertainty about EMU in the light of the ongoing debate about prospective membership and about how far the ECB will in practice be free to pursue its statutory task of maintaining price stability. It may  on the other hand  simply reflect some kind of market imperfection. The same analysis can be applied to Italy and Spain  for example  to try to assess market expectations about their possible membership of EMU as part of the first wave. It shows that notwithstanding the recent falls in short-term interest rates in those countries - which can largely be explained by their improved economic performance - 5 years forward yields remain significantly higher than those in Germany and France suggesting that early EMU membership is not at all certain in the eyes of the markets. BIS Review 22/1997 - 4 - What can we conclude from all this  Mr. Chairman? Well  the conclusions that I draw are essentially threefold and hardly very surprising. I conclude  first  that markets at present are reasonably persuaded that the world economy as a whole will remain relatively stable at least by comparison with much of the post war period. Excluding short-term influences  bond yields in the major countries - apart from the special case of Japan - are converging around a level of around 7% which suggests that relative macro-economic  monetary and fiscal discipline will be sustained  though it will stop short of effective price stability. I conclude  secondly  that the markets see current developments in the US and the UK as essentially cyclical; and that they anticipate a pick-up in activity elsewhere somewhat further ahead. And I conclude  thirdly  that there remains some considerable uncertainty about the prospect for European Monetary Union  in particular about its initial membership but also about the extent of the discipline it will involve. Now  of course  these conclusions are based on the bond markets as they currently are  which is a bit like forecasting the past! What you really need to know is how the markets will evolve in the future. Happily it is not my task to venture down that path. It is during our next session that the market experts will seek to “forecast the future”. But I do hope they will tell us whether they agree that relative stability will indeed persist  in the medium and longer term  how they see the different national situations evolving in the more immediate future  and what prospects they see for EMU. These seem to me to be the key issues for the future and I look forward to listening to what they have to say. BIS Review 22/1997

I appreciate the opportunity to appear before this Committee to present the Federal Reserve’s semiannual report on monetary policy. The performance of the U.S. economy over the past year has been quite favorable. Real GDP growth has picked up to more than three percent over the four quarters of 1996  as the economy progressed through its sixth year of expansion. Employers added more than two-and-a-half million workers to their payrolls in 1996  and the unemployment rate fell further. Nominal wages and salaries have increased faster than prices  meaning workers have gained ground in real terms  reflecting the benefits of rising productivity. Outside the food and energy sectors  increases in consumer prices actually have continued to edge lower  with core CPI inflation only 2½ percent over the past twelve months. Low inflation last year was both a symptom and a cause of the good economy. It was symptomatic of the balance and solidity of the expansion and the evident absence of major strains on resources. At the same time  continued low levels of inflation and inflation expectations have been a key support for healthy economic performance. They have helped to create a financial and economic environment conducive to strong capital spending and longer-range planning generally  and so to sustained economic expansion. Consequently  the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) believes it is crucial to keep inflation contained in the near term and ultimately to move toward price stability. Looking ahead  the members of the FOMC expect inflation to remain low and the economy to grow appreciably further. However  as I shall be discussing  the unusually good inflation performance of recent years seems to owe in large part to some temporary factors  of uncertain longevity. Thus  the FOMC continues to see the distribution of inflation risks skewed to the upside and must remain especially alert to the possible emergence of imbalances in financial and product markets that ultimately could endanger the maintenance of the low-inflation environment. Sustainable economic expansion for 1997 and beyond depends on it. For some  the benign inflation outcome of 1996 might be considered surprising  as resource utilization rates -- particularly of labor -- were in the neighborhood of those that historically have been associated with building inflation pressures. To be sure  an acceleration in nominal labor compensation  especially its wage component  became evident over the past year. But the rate of pay increase still was markedly less than historical relationships with labor market conditions would have predicted. A typical restraint on compensation increases has been evident for a few years now and appears to be mainly the consequence of greater worker insecurity. In 1991  at the bottom of the recession  a survey of workers at large firms by International Survey Research Corporation indicated that 25 percent feared being laid off. In 1996  despite the sharply lower unemployment rate and the tighter labor market  the same survey organization found that 46 percent were fearful of a job layoff. The reluctance of workers to leave their jobs to seek other employment as the labor market tightened has provided further evidence of such concern  as has the tendency toward longer labor union contracts. For many decades  contracts rarely exceeded three years. Today  one can point to five- and six-year contracts -- contracts that are commonly characterized BIS Review 22/1997 - 2 - by an emphasis on job security and that involve only modest wage increases. The low level of work stoppages of recent years also attests to concern about job security. Thus  the willingness of workers in recent years to trade off smaller increases in wages for greater job security seems to be reasonably well documented. The unanswered question is why this insecurity persisted even as the labor market  by all objective measures  tightened considerably. One possibility may lie in the rapid evolution of technologies in use in the work place. Technological change almost surely has been an important impetus behind corporate restructuring and downsizing. Also  it contributes to the concern of workers that their job skills may become inadequate. No longer can one expect to obtain all of one’s lifetime job skills with a high-school or college diploma. Indeed  continuing education is perceived to be increasingly necessary to retain a job. The more pressing need to update job skills is doubtless also a factor in the marked expansion of on-the-job training programs  especially in technical areas  in many of the nation’s corporations. Certainly  other factors have contributed to the softness in compensation growth in the past few years. The sharp deceleration in health care costs  of course  is cited frequently. Another is the heightened pressure on firms and their workers in industries that compete internationally. Domestic deregulation has had similar effects on the intensity of competitive forces in some industries. In any event  although I do not doubt that all these factors are relevant  I would be surprised if they were nearly as important as job insecurity. If heightened job insecurity is the most significant explanation of the break with the past in recent years  then it is important to recognize that  as I indicated in last February’s Humphrey-Hawkins testimony  suppressed wage cost growth as a consequence of job insecurity can be carried only so far. At some point  the tradeoff of subdued wage growth for job security has to come to an end. In other words  the relatively modest wage gains we have experienced are a temporary rather than a lasting phenomenon because there is a limit to the value of additional job security people are willing to acquire in exchange for lesser increases in living standards. Even if real wages were to remain permanently on a lower upward track than otherwise as a result of the greater sense of insecurity  the rate of change of wages would revert at some point to a normal relationship with inflation. The unknown is when this transition period will end. Indeed  some recent evidence suggests that the labor markets bear especially careful watching for signs that the return to more normal patterns may be in process. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that people were somewhat more willing to quit their jobs to seek other employment in January than previously. The possibility that this reflects greater confidence by workers accords with a recent further rise in the percent of households responding to a Conference Board survey who perceive that job availability is plentiful. Of course  the job market has continued to be quite good recently; employment in January registered robust growth and initial claims for unemployment insurance have been at a relatively low level of late. Wages rose faster in 1996 than in 1995 by most measures  perhaps also raising questions about whether the transitional period of unusually slow wage gains may be drawing to a close. To be sure  the pickup in wage gains has not shown through to underlying price inflation. Increases in the core CPI  as well as in several broader measures of prices  have stayed subdued or even edged off further in recent months. As best we can judge  faster productivity growth last year meant that rising compensation gains did not cause labor costs per unit of output to increase any more rapidly. Non-labor costs  which are roughly a quarter of total consolidated costs of the nonfinancial corporate sector  were little changed in 1996. BIS Review 22/1997 - 3 - Owing in part to this subdued behavior of unit costs  profits and rates of return on capital have risen to high levels. As a consequence  businesses believe that  were they to raise prices to boost profits further  competitors with already ample profit margins would not follow suit; instead  they would use the occasion to capture a greater market share. This interplay is doubtless a significant factor in the evident loss of pricing power in American business. Intensifying global competition also may be further restraining domestic firms’ ability to hike prices as well as wages. Clearly  the appreciation of the dollar on balance over the past eighteen months or so  together with low inflation in many of our trading partners  has resulted in a marked decline in non-oil import prices that has helped to damp domestic inflation pressures. Yet it is important to emphasize that these influences  too  would be holding down inflation only temporarily; they represent a transition to a lower price level than would otherwise prevail  not to a permanently lower rate of inflation. Against the background of all these considerations  the FOMC has recognized the need to remain vigilant for signs of potentially inflationary imbalances that might  if not corrected promptly  undermine our economic expansion. The FOMC in fact has signaled a state of heightened alert for possible policy tightening since last July in its policy directives. But  we have also taken care not to act prematurely. The FOMC refrained from changing policy last summer  despite expectations of a near-term policy firming by many financial market participants. In light of the developments I’ve just discussed affecting wages and prices  we thought inflation might well remain damped  and in any case was unlikely to pick up very rapidly  in part because the economic expansion appeared likely to slow to a more sustainable pace. In the event  inflation has remained quiescent since then. Given the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy  however  we cannot rule out a situation in which a preemptive policy tightening may become appropriate before any sign of actual higher inflation becomes evident. If the FOMC were to implement such an action  it would be judging that the risks to the economic expansion of waiting longer had increased unduly and had begun to outweigh the advantages of waiting for uncertainties to be reduced by the accumulation of more information about economic trends. Indeed  the hallmark of a successful policy to foster sustainable economic growth is that inflation does not rise. I find it ironic that our actions in 1994-95 were criticized by some because inflation did not turn upward. That outcome  of course  was the intent of the tightening  and I am satisfied that our actions then were both necessary and effective  and helped to foster the continued economic expansion. To be sure  1997 is not 1994. The real federal funds rate today is significantly higher than it was three years ago. Then we had just completed an extended period of monetary ease which addressed the credit stringencies of the early 1990s  and with the abatement of the credit crunch  the low real funds rate of early 1994 was clearly incompatible with containing inflation and sustaining growth going forward. In February 1997  in contrast  our concern is a matter of relative risks rather than of expected outcomes. The real funds rate  judging by core inflation  is only slightly below its early 1995 peak for this cycle and might be at a level that will promote continued non-inflationary growth  especially considering the recent rise in the exchange value of the dollar. Nonetheless  we cannot be sure. And the risks of being wrong are clearly tilted to the upside. I wish it were possible to lay out in advance exactly what conditions have to prevail to portend a buildup of inflation pressures or inflationary psychology. However  the circumstances that have been associated with increasing inflation in the past have not followed a BIS Review 22/1997 - 4 - single pattern. The processes have differed from cycle to cycle  and what may have been a useful leading indicator in one instance has given off misleading signals in another. I have already discussed the key role of labor market developments in restraining inflation in the current cycle and our careful monitoring of signs that the transition phase of trading off lower real wages for greater job security might be coming to a close. As always  with resource utilization rates high  we would need to watch closely a situation in which demand was clearly unsustainable because it was producing escalating pressures on resources  which could destabilize the economy. And we would need to be watchful that the progress we have made in keeping inflation expectations damped was not eroding. In general  though  our analysis will need to encompass all potentially relevant information  from financial markets as well as the economy  especially when some signals  like those in the labor market  have not been following their established patterns. The ongoing economic expansion to date has reinforced our conviction about the importance of low inflation -- and the public’s confidence in continued low inflation. The economic expansion almost surely would not have lasted nearly so long had monetary policy supported an unsustainable acceleration of spending that induced a buildup of inflationary imbalances. The Federal Reserve must not acquiesce in an upcreep in inflation  for acceding to higher inflation would countenance an insidious weakening of our chances for sustaining long-run economic growth. Inflation interferes with the efficient allocation of resources by confusing price signals  undercutting a focus on the longer run  and distorting incentives. This year overall inflation is anticipated to stay restrained. The central tendency of the forecasts made by the Board members and Reserve Bank presidents has the increase in the total CPI slipping back into a range of 2¾ to 3 percent over the four quarters of the year. This slight falloff from last year’s pace is expected to owe in part to a slower rise in food prices as some of last year’s supply limitations ease. More importantly  world oil supplies are projected by most analysts to increase relative to world oil demand  and futures markets project a further decline in prices  at least in the near term. The recent and prospective declines in crude oil prices not only should affect retail gasoline and home heating oil prices but also should relieve inflation pressures through lower prices for other petroleum products  which are imbedded in the economy’s underlying cost structure. Nonetheless  the trend in inflation rates in the core CPI and in broader price measures may be somewhat less favorable than in recent years. A continued tight labor market  whose influence on costs would be augmented by the scheduled increase in the minimum wage later in the year and perhaps by higher growth of benefits now that considerable health-care savings already have been realized  could put upward pressure on core inflation. Moreover  the effects of the sharp rise in the dollar over the last eighteen months in pushing down import prices are likely to ebb over coming quarters. The unemployment rate  according to Board members and Bank presidents  should stay around 5¼ to 5½ percent through the fourth quarter  consistent with their projections of measured real GDP growth of 2 to 2¼ percent over the four quarters of the year. Such a growth rate would represent some downshifting in output expansion from that of last year. The projected moderation of growth likely would reflect several influences: (1) declines in real federal government purchases should be exerting a modest degree of restraint on overall demand; (2) the lagged effects of the increase in the exchange value of the dollar in recent months likely will damp U.S. net exports somewhat this year; and (3) residential construction is unlikely to repeat the gains of 1996. On the other hand  we do not see evidence of widespread imbalances either in business inventories or in stocks of equipment and consumer durables that would lead to a substantial cutback in spending. And financial conditions overall remain BIS Review 22/1997 - 5 - supportive; real interest rates are not high by historical standards and credit is readily available from intermediaries and in the market. The usual uncertainties in the overall outlook are especially focused on the behavior of consumers. Consumption should rise roughly in line with the projected moderate expansion of disposable income  but both upside and downside risks are present. According to various surveys  sentiment is decidedly upbeat. Consumers have enjoyed healthy gains in their real incomes along with the extraordinary stock-market driven rise in their financial wealth over the last couple of years. Indeed  econometric models suggest that the more than $4 trillion rise in equity values since late 1994 should have had a larger positive influence on consumer spending than seems to have actually occurred. It is possible  however  that households have been reluctant to spend much of their added wealth because they see a greater need to keep it to support spending in retirement. Many households have expressed heightened concern about their financial security in old age  which reportedly has led to increased provision for retirement. The results of a survey conducted annually by the Roper Organization  which asks individuals about their confidence in the Social Security system  shows that between 1992 and 1996 the percent of respondents expressing little or no confidence in the system jumped from about 45 percent to more than 60 percent. Moreover  consumer debt burdens are near historical highs  while credit card delinquencies and personal bankruptcies have risen sharply over the past year. These circumstances may make both borrowers and lenders a bit more cautious  damping spending. In fact  we may be seeing both wealth and debt effects already at work for different segments of the population  to an approximately offsetting extent. Saving out of current income by households in the upper income quintile  who own nearly three-fourths of all non-pension equities held by households  evidently has declined in recent years. At the same time  the use of credit for purchases appears to have leveled off after a sharp runup from 1993 to 1996  perhaps because some households are becoming debt constrained and  as a result  are curtailing their spending. The Federal Reserve will be weighing these influences as it endeavors to help extend the current period of sustained growth. Participants in financial markets seem to believe that in the current benign environment the FOMC will succeed indefinitely. There is no evidence  however  that the business cycle has been repealed. Another recession will doubtless occur some day owing to circumstances that could not be  or at least were not  perceived by policymakers and financial market participants alike. History demonstrates that participants in financial markets are susceptible to waves of optimism  which can in turn foster a general process of asset-price inflation that can feed through into markets for goods and services. Excessive optimism sows the seeds of its own reversal in the form of imbalances that tend to grow over time. When unwarranted expectations ultimately are not realized  the unwinding of these financial excesses can act to amplify a downturn in economic activity  much as they can amplify the upswing. As you know  last December I put the question this way: “...how do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values  which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions ...?” We have not been able  as yet  to provide a satisfying answer to this question  but there are reasons in the current environment to keep this question on the table. Clearly  when people are exposed to long periods of relative economic tranquility  they seem inevitably prone to complacency about the future. This is understandable. We have had fifteen years of economic expansion interrupted by only one recession -- and that was six years ago. As the memory of such past events fades  it naturally seems ever less sensible to keep up one’s guard against an BIS Review 22/1997 - 6 - adverse event in the future. Thus  it should come as no surprise that  after such a long period of balanced expansion  risk premiums for advancing funds to businesses in virtually all financial markets have declined to near-record lows. Is it possible that there is something fundamentally new about this current period that would warrant such complacency? Yes  it is possible. Markets may have become more efficient  competition is more global  and information technology has doubtless enhanced the stability of business operations. But  regrettably  history is strewn with visions of such “new eras” that  in the end  have proven to be a mirage. In short  history counsels caution. Such caution seems especially warranted with regard to the sharp rise in equity prices during the past two years. These gains have obviously raised questions of sustainability. Analytically  current stock-price valuations at prevailing long-term interest rates could be justified by very strong earnings growth expectations. In fact  the long-term earnings projections of financial analysts have been marked up noticeably over the last year and seem to imply very high earnings growth and continued rising profit margins  at a time when such margins are already up appreciably from their depressed levels of five years ago. It could be argued that  although margins are the highest in a generation  they are still below those that prevailed in the 1960s. Nonetheless  further increases in these margins would evidently require continued restraint on costs: labor compensation continuing to grow at its current pace and productivity growth picking up. Neither  of course  can be ruled out. But we should keep in mind that  at these relatively low long-term interest rates  small changes in long-term earnings expectations could have outsized impacts on equity prices. Caution also seems warranted by the narrow yield spreads that suggest perceptions of low risk  possibly unrealistically low risk. Considerable optimism about the ability of businesses to sustain this current healthy financial condition seems  as I indicated earlier  to be influencing the setting of risk premiums  not just in the stock market but throughout the financial system. This optimistic attitude has become especially evident in quality spreads on high-yield corporate bonds -- what we used to call “junk bonds.” In addition  banks have continued to ease terms and standards on business loans  and margins on many of these loans are now quite thin. Many banks are pulling back a little from consumer credit card lending as losses exceed expectations. Nonetheless  some bank and nonbank lenders have been expanding aggressively into the home equity loan market and so-called “subprime” auto lending  although recent problems in the latter may already be introducing a sense of caution. Why should the central bank be concerned about the possibility that financial markets may be overestimating returns or mispricing risk? It is not that we have a firm view that equity prices are necessarily excessive right now or risk spreads patently too low. Our goal is to contribute as best we can to the highest possible growth of income and wealth over time  and we would be pleased if the favorable economic environment projected in markets actually comes to pass. Rather  the FOMC has to be sensitive to indications of even slowly building imbalances  whatever their source  that  by fostering the emergence of inflation pressures  would ultimately threaten healthy economic expansion. Unfortunately  because the monetary aggregates were subject to an episode of aberrant behavioral patterns in the early 1990s  they are likely to be of only limited help in making this judgment. For three decades starting in the early 1960s  the public’s demand for the broader monetary aggregates  especially M2  was reasonably predictable. In the intermediate term  M2 velocity -- nominal income divided by the stock of M2 -- tended to vary directly with the difference between money market yields and the return on M2 assets -- that is  with its BIS Review 22/1997 - 7 - short-term opportunity cost. In the long run  as adjustments in deposit rates caused the opportunity cost to revert to an equilibrium  M2 velocity also tended to return to an associated stable equilibrium level. For several years in the early 1990s  however  the velocities of M2 and M3 exhibited persisting upward shifts that departed markedly from these historical patterns. In the last two to three years  velocity patterns seem to have returned to those historical relationships  after allowing for a presumed permanent upward shift in the levels of velocity. Even so  given the abnormal velocity behavior during the early 1990s  FOMC members continue to see considerable uncertainty in the relationship of broad money to opportunity costs and nominal income. Concern about the possibility of aberrant behavior has made the FOMC hesitant to upgrade the role of these measures in monetary policy. Against this background  at its February meeting  the FOMC reaffirmed the provisional ranges set last July for money and debt growth this year: 1 to 5 percent for M2  2 to 6 percent for M3  and 3 to 7 percent for the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors. The M2 and M3 ranges again are designed to be consistent with the FOMC’s long-run goal of price stability: For  if the velocities of the broader monetary aggregates were to continue behaving as they did before 1990  then money growth around the middle portions of the ranges would be consistent with noninflationary  sustainable economic expansion. But  even with such velocity behavior this year  when inflation is expected to still be higher than is consistent with our long-run objective of reasonable price stability  the broader aggregates could well grow around the upper bounds of these ranges. The debt aggregate probably will expand around the middle of its range this year. I will conclude on the same upbeat note about the U.S. economy with which I began. Although a central banker’s occupational responsibility is to stay on the lookout for trouble  even I must admit that our economic prospects in general are quite favorable. The flexibility of our market system and the vibrancy of our private sector remain examples for the whole world to emulate. The Federal Reserve will endeavor to do its part by continuing to foster a monetary framework under which our citizens can prosper to the fullest possible extent. BIS Review 22/1997

In January  according to the business leaders surveyed by the Banque de France  industrial output continued to grow in most sectors. Activity was especially buoyant in the intermediate goods and consumer goods sectors. The food processing sector was alone in recording a contraction in activity. The capacity utilization rate improved. Overall demand strengthened further. French products were very competitive on foreign markets and this led to an increase in export orders. Export sales increased in the United Kingdom  Italy and Germany  while demand remained firm in the United States and Asia. On the domestic market  inter-industry demand was strong  even though the orders received came with very short delivery times in most cases. Order books are now near to normal levels. They are still considered to be low in the food-processing and automobile industries  but are deemed to be satisfactory in the capital goods and consumer goods sectors. Inventories of finished products are gradually returning to normal overall  but they still exceed the desired levels in the consumer goods  food-processing and intermediate goods sectors. The outlook for the coming months is distinctly brighter. Activity should increase in all sectors  with marked improvements in the intermediate goods and food-processing sectors. Commodity prices were stable overall  while finished product prices declined slightly. This fall stemmed mainly from substantial price cuts in the automobile industry  while prices generally held up in the other sectors. Investment plans for 1997 appear to be less ambitious on the whole compared with capital spending plans at the same period in 1996. Nevertheless  the business leaders polled in January were more confident about future activity than they were a few months earlier. This could mean that previously postponed investment plans may be implemented in the coming months. However  plans for increasing output capacity remained few and far between  owing to the spare capacity currently available  and depend on stronger growth in demand. Retail sales in January were up markedly over December 1996  and only slightly down on the exceptionally high level recorded a year earlier. Employment levels remained stable in nearly all industrial sectors. They showed only a slight change in the services and retail sectors  but there were further falls in the building industry.

Brash  to the Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce in Christchurch on 23/1/97.,Dr. Brash explains the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s new inflation target  and New Zealander’s expectations about inflation and growth Address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand  Dr. Donald T. Brash  to the Canterbury Employers’ Chamber of Commerce in Christchurch on 23/1/97. Introduction As perhaps you know  this is the fourth time on which I have been invited to address the Canterbury Employers’ Chamber of Commerce at your first luncheon meeting of the New Year and I want to use the occasion to talk about two issues. First  I want to talk about the new Policy Targets Agreement  amending the inflation target from 0 to 2 percent to 0 to 3 percent  signed last month. And secondly  I want to talk about the expectations which we New Zealanders have about both inflation and economic growth. In some The new inflation target First  the new Policy Targets Agreement. There have been two changes made in the new PTA  but I suspect that to the general public the only difference between the new Agreement and all of the earlier ones is that the new Agreement has changed the ‘definition’ of price stability from 0 to 2 percent to 0 to 3 percent  while making it clear that delivering that price stability remains the single objective of monetary policy and constitutes the best way in which the Reserve Bank can contribute to New Zealand’s economic development. Some will ask in anger why the inflation target is still so low  and why the Bank will continue to focus monetary policy on delivering that target  when there are other objectives - such as economic growth  employment  and export competitiveness - which are at least as important and in many respects more so. Others will feel betrayed that the ceiling of the inflation target has been raised from 2 to 3 percent  or that the mid-point of the target has been raised from 1 percent to 1.5 percent  particularly given the fact that the two largest parties in Parliament were both strong advocates of a mid-point of 1 percent during the last election campaign. I want to try to respond to both groups of critics. In many ways the easiest critics to respond to are those who feel that the inflation target is still too low  or that  given the extent to which the economy has been slowing in recent months and the extent of the pressures on the export sector  the Bank’s objectives should have been widened to include those other objectives. For there is in fact no evidence that monetary policy can  by tolerating a little more inflation  engineer a sustainably higher rate of growth  or a sustainably higher level of employment  or a sustainable improvement in export competitiveness. To be sure  monetary policy can engineer faster growth  higher employment and improved exporter competitiveness in the short term - by tolerating a bit more inflation right now  there is not much doubt that growth and employment would be a little higher in 1997 than otherwise  and that exporters would enjoy the benefits of a lower exchange rate. Most of that faster growth and higher employment would be bought at the cost of tricking working New Zealanders into accepting a reduction in their real wages  as prices rose ahead of wages. However  it would not last. Before too long  people would recognise the deception and would demand compensation in the form of higher wages and salaries. Within a very short time  inflation would be rising  growth would be back to its previous  lower  level and we would be left contemplating the cost of reducing inflation again - and nobody should forget the very substantial one-off costs  in terms of unemployment and lost output  incurred in reducing inflation from levels above 15 percent in the mid-1980s to our current situation of price stability in the early and mid-1990s. BIS Review 23/1997 - 2 - Not only is there no evidence that tolerating more inflation can engineer sustainably faster real growth  there is now overwhelming evidence that high inflation positively damages the way in which the economy works - reduces the capacity for sustainable growth and higher employment  and of course also does huge social damage  through the arbitrary redistribution of income and wealth which it creates. There is also very considerable evidence that even quite low rates of inflation do damage to growth and employment  and virtually no evidence that inflation actually helps those objectives. This is why the second of the two changes in the Policy Targets Agreement makes clear that it is precisely in order to enable monetary policy to make its maximum contribution to sustainable ‘growth  employment and development opportunities’ that the Bank is directed to focus on maintaining a stable general level of prices. But isn’t there some concern  fostered in the popular media by the American economist Paul Krugman  that if inflation is too low it may actually damage growth? In other words  even if we accept that high or even moderate inflation is damaging  isn’t it possible that central banks which are excessively obsessive about achieving no inflation might actually be harming the economy and the society they claim to be helping? This brings me to the second group of critics  who are concerned that in changing from 0 to 2 percent to 0 to 3 percent we have betrayed the intention of the Reserve Bank Act  requiring that monetary policy focus exclusively on delivering ‘stability in the general level of prices’. There is quite intense debate going on at the moment around the world among central bankers and academic economists about what the best specification of a low inflation target should be. There are two broad schools. The first school accepts that monetary policy should be focused on delivering predictably low inflation but argues that for several reasons that target is best expressed as inflation in a range of 1 to 3 percent. The best known advocate of this ‘low positive inflation’ school is probably Stanley Fischer  formerly of MIT and now Senior Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund. He is visiting New Zealand next month  and it is likely that his views will receive appropriately wide media coverage at that time. He argues for this ‘low positive’ inflation target for various reasons  of which three are particularly important: The way in which inflation is measured results in quite a significant over-statement of actual inflation. Estimates of this over-statement in the United States have suggested that  in that country  the ‘bias’ in the measurement of inflation is between 0.7 and 2.0 percent  with bias of 1.1 percent very recently estimated by a group chaired by Michael Boskin on behalf of the United States Senate Finance Committee. For this reason  central banks should target measured inflation of at least 1 percent  because to target anything lower than that would be to target de facto deflation. Because at some stage in the cycles through which all economies go it may be necessary in the interests of maintaining a high level of employment for there to be some reduction in inflation-adjusted (or real) wages  having a low positive level of inflation is more desirable than having absolutely no inflation. This is because  with some inflation  real wages can be slightly reduced by simply giving no increase in nominal wages  whereas with no inflation reducing real wages involves having to actually reduce nominal wages. Real wages can still be reduced  even with no inflation  but only at the expense of higher unemployment. Similarly  it is argued that at some stage in the economic cycle it may be desirable for inflation-adjusted interest rates to fall below zero to provide a strong stimulus to demand and  since it BIS Review 23/1997 - 3 - is not generally practical for nominal interest rates to fall below zero  it is helpful if inflation is some low positive number to make negative real interest rates possible. The second school of thought argues for a lower inflation target  often characterised by 0 to 2 percent but sometimes expressed as the level of average prices remaining stable over time. Those who favour this view discount the arguments advanced by the ‘low positive’ school. They acknowledge that there is an upward bias in the way in which inflation is measured  but argue that in most countries outside the United States that bias is almost certainly less than 1 percent and certainly could not justify a target with a mid-point of 2 percent. (The New Zealand Government Statistician is strongly convinced that there is less bias in the measurement of the New Zealand CPI than there is in the measurement of the US CPI.) They acknowledge that it has not been easy to adjust nominal wages downwards in recent years  but argue that in substantial part that is a result of the persistently high inflation most countries have experienced in recent decades  so that that should be no more than a transitional problem. Moreover  even though it may be difficult to reduce the wages of an individual employee  that does not prevent a significant reduction in unit labour costs as a result both of unchanged wages and positive productivity  and of natural turnover in the labour force. Critics of the ‘low positive’ school challenge the assertion that monetary policy occasionally needs to reduce real interest rates below zero  and note other ways in which monetary policy can stimulate demand  particularly in very open economies where movements in the exchange rate play an important role in influencing aggregate demand in the short term. Those favouring very low inflation (0 to 2 percent) argue that not only are there no advantages in tolerating a ‘low positive’ rate of inflation there are also significant disadvantages of even quite low rates of inflation. Thus for example Martin Feldstein of Harvard University (and current president of the National Bureau of Economic Research in the US) argues strongly that even very low levels of inflation significantly exacerbate the biases in the tax system which encourage consumption  discourage saving  and encourage excessive investment in residential property. In a recent paper he argued that reducing measured inflation from 3 percent to 1 percent in the United States would result in a permanent increase in the level of US GDP of 1 percent  a very large gain in economic well-being even if there is some temporary loss of output required to reduce inflation to that level. Others have also argued that the interaction between inflation on the one hand and tax and financial reporting systems geared to historical cost accounting on the other creates a significant bias against capital-intensive investment projects and all investment with a long pay-back period  and a bias in favour of highly-geared companies and investments with a short pay-back period. This debate is by no means concluded. At a major conference I attended last August in the United States  it seemed to me that a majority of those who expressed an opinion favoured a 0 to 2 percent target  and that has been my own clear predilection. But given that there are very experienced central bankers and monetary economists in both schools  it is at this stage quite inappropriate to be dogmatic  and in my own view a target which involves doing our utmost to keep measured inflation between 0 and 3 percent is certainly consistent with the intention of the legislation within which monetary policy is operated. Indeed  irrespective of where the mid-point of the target range should be  there may be some advantage in having a slightly wider inflation target than the original 0 to 2 percent target. A number of observers have suggested that a target with a width of only 2 percentage points requires an excessive degree of activism on the part of the central bank  and that a slightly wider band  whatever its mid-point  would be sensible. This has been argued  for example  by David Turner  an OECD economist. The tension is between  on the one hand  choosing a target range which effectively anchors inflation expectations at a low level but which is so narrow that it provokes excessive policy activism and risks loss of credibility by being frequently exceeded; and on the other  a target range which does a less effective job of anchoring inflation expectations  but which requires less policy BIS Review 23/1997 - 4 - activism and protects credibility by being rarely breached. A 0 to 3 percent range seems a reasonable compromise. But whether there is any benefit at all from a wider target band depends significantly on how a wider band  with a higher ‘ceiling’  affects the public’s expectations of future inflation. If people understand the new target as meaning that the Bank  under Government instructions  is now willing to accept 1 percent more inflation than previously  then nothing positive will have been achieved at all - and indeed there will almost certainly be net cost involved in the change. This is because any increase in inflationary expectations would tend to feed into slightly higher pricing decisions  slightly higher wage settlements  slightly greater eagerness to borrow  slightly less enthusiasm for saving. If the Bank were willing to accept this behaviour  ‘accommodate’ it in the jargon  we would end up with somewhat higher inflation but no other result (though of course the higher inflation would have all the negative consequences for the real economy referred to earlier). If the Bank were in fact not prepared to accommodate this increase in inflationary expectations - which it would not be I hasten to emphasise - then the end result of increased inflationary expectations would simply be higher real interest rates  somewhat lower economic growth  and somewhat higher unemployment. If that were the end result  the widening of the inflation target would not only provide no benefit it would be positively damaging. So I think it is crucially important that nobody misunderstand what the Reserve Bank is doing. Let me be absolutely clear. The Reserve Bank has not gone soft on inflation. We will not be targeting an inflation rate of 3 percent  or even an inflation rate close to 3 percent. The Reserve Bank will be striving to keep inflation well inside the 0 to 3 percent range  and we best do that by trying to have inflation as close to the middle part of the range as possible. That does not mean  of course  that we will always hit the target  any more than we always hit 0 to 2 percent. But it does mean that we will be constantly implementing monetary policy with the intention of having inflation as defined around the middle part of the target. If we do this  the number of occasions on which we miss the target should be minimised. Indeed  given the wider target range  there should be fewer breaches than in the past. Inflation and growth expectations And this leads naturally into the second major theme of my address today  about New Zealanders’ expectations about inflation and growth. It is my contention that expectations about both need to become a lot more realistic. First  let’s look at expectations of inflation. Yes  there are some encouraging signs that New Zealanders’ expectations of future inflation have fallen substantially over the last decade as actual inflation has fallen. Surveys of inflation expectations currently suggest that  on average  householders now expect year-ahead inflation to be around 3.9 percent  well down on the levels of the late 1980s (year-ahead inflation expectations were 12.5 percent on average towards the end of 1987  and were still 8.3 percent near the end of 1989)  while 10 year bond yields are slightly lower than 10 year bond yields in Australia and less than 1 percent higher than 10 year yields in the US. Wage settlements in recent years have also been one of the areas where inflation expectations seem to have been subdued  with a great many wage settlements concluded at levels which have  until recently at least  put little upward pressure on prices. However  other indications are not nearly as encouraging and suggest that New Zealanders’ inflation expectations are still showing the effects of the two decades of high inflation we endured in the 1970s and 1980s. BIS Review 23/1997 - 5 - Look at New Zealanders’ saving behaviour for example. Among those with financial assets  how many are locking in the high real interest rates they purport to see by investing in long-term fixed interest instruments  such as term bank deposits or government bonds? The short answer is ‘very few’. To be sure  our bond yields are now comparable to international bond yields  and I used to deduce from that that the new monetary policy framework had produced a profound reduction in inflationary expectations. I now believe that I was unjustifiably optimistic  because it is foreign savers who have bought our bonds in huge volumes  thereby reducing bond yields to international levels. More than half the New Zealand government bonds on issue are now held overseas  and the proportion of some of the longer-dated bonds held overseas is even higher. (In recent months  for example  more than 70 percent of the longest-dated nominal bond held by the market has been held by overseas investors.) If we look at the term structure of the New Zealand- sourced deposits of any major bank  we will see that overwhelmingly New Zealanders are holding their cash and fixed interest investments at very short term  the great bulk with a maturity of less than 12 months. Indeed  most banks have close to 90 percent of their total deposits maturing within six months  and very few have more than 5 percent of their deposits maturing beyond 12 months. By and large  most New Zealanders do not invest their savings in long-term fixed interest securities at all  despite what are  on the face of it  very attractive inflation-adjusted interest rates. What are we doing with our savings? Though the data on saving behaviour in New Zealand is not very good  anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that New Zealanders invest any available saving in some form of equity investment  most typically property: a bigger house to live in  another house to rent out  a bigger farm  another piece of farmland  perhaps a block of flats  a beach-side section  an industrial property  a commercial building  perhaps a forest block  anything which  the best-selling books and advertisements constantly tell us  will protect us against inflation. Protect us against inflation? But we’ve hardly had any inflation for the last six years and  despite the biggest change in New Zealand’s constitutional arrangements this century  we have just had the new Coalition Government re-affirm the strong commitment to price stability. True  but we’ve certainly had two decades of high inflation in the memory of all adult New Zealanders and we all know of people who lost most of their life’s savings over that period by ‘making the mistake’ of investing in ‘secure’ fixed-interest investments. I’ve told the true story of my uncle so many times that I am almost embarrassed to tell it again  but in my view it contains the explanation of much of the current approach to saving in New Zealand  so I will tell it again. After a life-time of orcharding in the Nelson area  he sold his orchard in 1971 and invested the sale proceeds ‘safely’ to provide income and security for his retirement. To be absolutely safe  he invested the entire proceeds in 18-year government stock  at the then-interest rate of 5.4 percent. Perhaps fortunately  he did not live until those bonds matured in 1989  but if he had done the $30 000 he received from selling his orchard in 1971 and which matured in 1989 would have bought him by that time just one Toyota Corolla car (with a little change). In 1971  $30 000 would have bought him 11 Toyota Corollas. In the space of just 18 years  he had lost some 90 percent of his retirement nest egg  all by making the mistake of assuming that inflation would stay at the relatively low level of 1971. As I say  most adult New Zealanders know stories similar to that one. Or they know stories which tell the same message in another way. Stories about people who bought a property with borrowed money in the early 1970s and watched the price of the house increase perhaps eight- or ten- fold over the next 20 years  with the value of the equity actually invested in the house (after allowing for the money borrowed to help finance the purchase) increasing perhaps 30 times. Perhaps we have had an experience like that ourselves. Even if we have not  we are assailed by books and advertisements on all sides which assure us that property investment is the best way of ‘protecting you against inflation’  to say nothing of making the most effective use of the tax system. Even if we are not familiar with the detail of the statistics  we know that in recent years residential property prices have risen hugely in much of the country  most obviously in Auckland. According to REINZ BIS Review 23/1997 - 6 - data  the median price of house sales in the Auckland district rose by 53 percent over the three years to December 1996  by 36 percent in the Southland district (including Queenstown)  and by 29 percent in the Waikato/Bay of Plenty district. Even rural land prices  which have come back markedly in some areas in recent months  rose by 45 percent over the three years to the first half of 1996  according to Valuation New Zealand data. Is it any wonder therefore that New Zealanders who claim to believe that consumer price inflation is more or less under control continue to borrow money enthusiastically at 9  10  and 11 percent to acquire property? Lest there be any misunderstanding  I am assuredly not against investing in property  let alone against home ownership. I own a home and a small amount of other property myself. I am merely saying that inflationary expectations are alive and well in the minds of most New Zealanders and that  until that situation changes  we will inevitably be looking at interest rates which look high in comparison to current consumer price inflation. Conversely  of course  as inflationary expectations abate  and particularly as expectations of property price inflation abate  the overall level of interest rates will tend to be lower also. Alan Greenspan  chairman of the US central bank  has on several occasions suggested that price stability obtains when economic agents - businesses and private individuals - no longer take account of the prospective change in the general price level in their economic decision-making. It is clear that we still have a little way to go. What about New Zealanders’ expectations for economic growth? Are these too quite unrealistic? I believe that they are  at least based on current policies and attitudes. In the early 1990s  New Zealand achieved real economic growth of more than 5 percent per annum for two years in succession. We were told that we were growing faster than any other OECD economy  and at growth rates comparable to those achieved by the East Asian ‘tiger’ economies. We began to believe that  as a result of the economic reforms of the last decade  we too were capable of 5 or 6 percent growth indefinitely and all of us wanted to believe that. Sadly  we can not  or at least there is no evidence yet that we can. The very fast growth of 1993 and 1994 was the result in part of the one-off productivity gains resulting from the micro-economic reforms of the late 1980s and early 1990s  and in a greater part of the economy having available a large number of unemployed and underemployed people  and unutilised industrial capacity  as a result of the recession of 1991 and early 1992. As these people and this capacity were brought back into productive work  the rate of growth of real output jumped well above its sustainable rate. The rate of unemployment fell very sharply from almost 11 percent to just over 6 percent in little more than three years and  while everybody hopes that unemployment falls further  it is clearly impossible to reduce the rate of unemployment by 5 percentage points every three years indefinitely. As I told the members of the Auckland Chamber last year  economic growth depends primarily not on monetary policy but on real factors - on how fast the labour force is growing  on how skilled the labour force is  on how much capital that labour force has to work with  on the technology embodied in the capital  on the efficiency of the price system in signalling where capital can be most productively invested  on the nature of regulations and restrictions which inhibit the effective working of the price system  and a host of other factors. Prices which are  on average  stable assist the pricing system to work effectively  and thereby help to ensure that investment takes place in the most economically sensible places. Prices which are  on average  stable tend to encourage saving  and thereby help to finance additional investment. But stable prices won’t make the labour force grow more quickly  or make the labour force more skilled  or improve the technology embodied in the capital equipment which the labour force uses  let alone make public sector enterprises more efficient; or improve the quality of the education system; or move resources out of highly protected sectors into those which can be competitive on international markets; or improve the marketing of commodity exports; or even give us East-Asian-type savings rates. BIS Review 23/1997 - 7 - I would argue strongly that price stability has been helpful to the improved performance of the New Zealand economy in recent years  but I have never claimed for a moment that price stability has been the sole reason for our better performance  nor that price stability guarantees us strong growth in the future. In addition to our ability to bring back into productive work people and capital equipment that had become unemployed during the recession  our very much improved growth performance in recent years has been the result of a whole range of policy changes - of reduced protection and regulation in the private sector  of corporatisation and privatisation of many formerly inefficient public sector enterprises  of a vastly less distorting tax structure  of port reform  of labour market reform  and all the rest. If we want to build on that achievement in the years ahead  we must constantly be seeking areas where productivity can be further improved. At this stage  the aggregate numbers for the economy as a whole have led the Reserve Bank to base its economic projections on trend labour productivity growth of no more than 1.25 percent per annum. If that turns out to be the case (and 1.25 percent is close to productivity growth in other mature economies  such as the United States1 and Australia)  total growth in GDP could well be around 3 percent per annum because of growth in the labour force. But growth in real income per head  which must surely be the real objective of economic policy  will not exceed 1.25 percent annually. If we want faster growth in spending than that  we can in the short term borrow to supplement our income but  as we learned in the 1970s and 1980s  that is ultimately futile. In the longer term  higher incomes per head  and the higher spending that that can bring  can only come from finding ways to accelerate productivity growth. And how do we do that? Certainly not by debasing the currency through tolerating inflation. The very rapid growth of the countries of East Asia is in part simply the result of their being able to pick up ‘off the shelf’ modern technologies  which have taken decades to develop elsewhere. In other words  there is a substantial element of ‘catch-up’ in the fast growth of East Asia. But the growth which has occasioned so much envy on the part of some New Zealanders has also been achieved in a particular cultural environment - a cultural environment which places enormous emphasis on family self-reliance  which abjures reliance on the state  which as a consequence generates a savings rate roughly double the New Zealand rate  which pursues education and training with a passion  which regards material affluence as a highly desirable goal. New Zealanders have  implicitly at least  chosen a slower growth path  by placing little emphasis on saving  by placing a more modest value on education and training  by valuing other goals more highly than affluence. I recall seeing a television programme three or four years ago about Asian students in our schools. The programme included comments from two New Zealand children that they resented the fact that the Asian children worked much harder than they did. I don’t think New Zealand children should be forced to work as hard as Asian children do  but I think it is important for our children to realise that they live in a world where those who work hard will end up with higher incomes and more wealth than those who choose to work less hard. If we are only prepared to pay for beer  we won’t be drinking a lot of champagne. The sooner we acknowledge that reality the better for all concerned. By not doing so  the risk is not only that private spending will constantly be running up against income constraints  but also that successive governments will be under considerable and unreasonable pressure to satisfy demands for increased public expenditure. Both will have serious implications for our ability to finance development from our own savings. 1 Indeed  over the period from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the second quarter of 1996 overall business sector productivity in the United States grew by only 0.3 percent per annum. BIS Review 23/1997 Conclusion - 8 - Mr. Chairman  let me conclude by summarising my main points. First  I am confident that the new inflation target set me by Government is consistent with the legislation under which the Bank operates and consistent with monetary policy continuing to make the best contribution of which it is capable to New Zealand society and the development of the New Zealand economy. Secondly  whether the slightly wider target band enables the economy to operate with slightly less central bank activism depends heavily on how the change affects the expectations which people have of future inflation. If people assume that  on average  inflation will be 1 percent higher than they assumed previously  there is a real danger that  far from providing additional flexibility  the wider target will actually harm the way in which the economy works. Let it be clearly understood  therefore  that the Bank will be implementing monetary policy with the intention of having inflation as defined in my agreement with the Minister around the middle part of the 0 to 3 percent target. If we do this  the number of occasions on which we miss the target should be minimised. It would clearly be very damaging if the impression were created that we might be content with inflation outcomes near the top of the target. Thirdly  we still have some work to do in convincing New Zealanders that our money is a predictably safe store of value for the relevant future. Until that is achieved  the interest rate at which the willingness to save in the form of financial assets is matched by the willingness to borrow will continue to look high by international standards  and our companies will continue to seek unrealistically high rates of return on investment projects. That will tend to mean that investment is lower than it might otherwise be  and that the exchange rate will be higher than otherwise. Fourthly  it is important that  while constantly aspiring to improve our national growth performance  we all have realistic expectations about the speed at which the New Zealand economy can actually grow. Recent reforms have undoubtedly increased our sustainable growth rate above that which was possible in the past: after several decades of growing much more slowly than other developed economies  we now seem capable of growth comparable to  and probably a little higher than  growth in many other mature economies  such as the United States and the United Kingdom. But we will probably never be able to equal the growth rates achieved recently by the ‘catch-up economies’  while growing faster than we currently can will depend not on the central bank being a little more tolerant of inflation but on continuing improvement in many other policy areas and on sustained productivity growth. The Reserve Bank makes its greatest contribution to New Zealand society by achieving and maintaining public confidence in the stability of the unit of value  predictably  dependably  reliably. BIS Review 23/1997
r970305e,1997-03-05,https://www.bis.org/review/r970305e.pdf,Mr. Davies reviews current debates on regulatory structures governing the financial system,"Speech by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England  Mr. Howard Davies  held on 22/2/97 at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta""s Financial Markets Conference entitled ""Market and Regulatory Structures in a Global Environment"".",Mr. Davies reviews current debates on regulatory structures governing the financial system Speech by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England  Mr. Howard Davies  held on 22/2/97 at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Financial Markets Conference entitled ‘Market and Regulatory Structures in a Global Environment’. It is conventional  and polite to say  at the beginning of a speech of this kind  that one is thrilled to have been asked to speak on the subject of the structure of financial regulation and that the topic is  of all the many preoccupations of human kind through the centuries  the one which generates the most enthusiasm and excitement in one’s breast. But I cannot bring myself to do it. You may think me ill-brought up to say this - if so blame my parents - but I find the question of the structure of regulation to be quite resistible. I know that there are those who like nothing better than to draw new organigrams and to explore the manifold interfaces between regulatory agencies. (There are also people who find self-fulfilment collecting airline sick bags  or watching synchronised swimming. That is a matter for them.) But my lack of enthusiasm for the topic of regulatory structure is  I hope  not an emotional response. It is rationally based on two prior beliefs. First  that the relationship between structure and effectiveness is loose. I know of little evidence that structural reforms are quickly followed by an enhancement of the effectiveness of the activity in which those agencies are engaged. Secondly  my prejudice is to believe that regulatory structure should follow market structure  rather than the other way round. Regulators should seek to respond to changing markets which  in turn  respond to changing customer demand and new product availability  rather than seeking to dictate either. So we should always ask ourselves whether the regulatory framework we adopt makes sense to market participants  rather than requiring them to structure their business to fit in with some governmentally imposed view of the way product delivery should be organised. But I recognise that  in practice  we cannot avoid constant attention to the maintenance of the regulatory framework. Firstly  because while good structure will not necessarily generate effectiveness  a faulty  out of date framework will certainly make it very hard for regulators to do their jobs well. And  of course  the market is not in an ‘original condition’. The financial markets we have now are heavily conditioned by the legislative and regulatory framework within which they have grown up. That is particularly true in the United States. It is hard to imagine that  absent Glass-Steagall  regulation Q and all the rest  the financial landscape in North America would look as it does today. So I conclude that the debate on regulatory structure should be a constant dialogue between the markets and the regulators  but with a prejudice in favour of the former. Our ultimate task as regulators is to ensure that markets work efficiently  and in the interests of consumers. Against that background  how is this dialogue proceeding in the UK at present? For we too are addressing the questions which preoccupy you in the United States  in our quaint  olde worlde British fashion. But before I review the current debate on regulatory structure in the UK  I should say a little about the way we define the objectives of financial regulation. We think of five: to BIS Review 21/1997 - 2 - protect the economy against systemic risk; to protect individual depositors  investors and insurance policy holders against loss from the failure of their intermediary; to protect customers against business misconduct; to assist society at large in the fight against crime (for instance by making sure firms have in place systems to detect and report laundered drug money and other proceeds of organised crime); and  last but not least  to create and sustain fair markets. Described bluntly  these objectives make the job of regulators look impossibly daunting. But of course they are not absolute aims. Regulators cannot  and should not  offer blanket assurances to investors and depositors. They cannot  because the tools and resources to do so are simply not available. And they should not  because it would be quite wrong to remove from investors and firms the responsibility for assessing  taking and monitoring financial risks. This is a very important point  which Alan Greenspan has helpfully underlined on a number of occasions recently. UK regulatory structure and proposals for change Across the world we see a lively debate on how the regulatory cake should be cut. There has been change in France. The Australian Government has set up the Wallis Commission to look at the institutional arrangements there. Their first report has just been published. Reforms are in progress in Japan. In the US the new legislative season is about to open  with a number of runners and riders already saddled up in the financial regulation steeplechase. Similarly  in the UK  a variety of think tanks  and the opposition Labour Party  have produced proposals to amend  or in some cases fundamentally reorder  our regulatory structure. But  before describing these exciting proposals  perhaps a brief description of the British system would be in order. Responsibility for financial regulation in the UK is divided between two Government Departments. Department of Trade and Industry Insurance Companies Act 1982 HM Treasury STRUCTURE OF UK FINANCIAL REGULATION Banking Act 1987 Financial Services Act 1986 Bank of England Securities and Investments Board Personal Investment Authority Retail Regulator Investment Management Regulatory Organisation Securities And Futures Authority Insurance Companies Banks Financial Advisers Securities Houses Fund Managers BIS Review 21/1997 - 3 - Most falls to the Treasury  but prudential supervision of insurance companies is the responsibility of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). The DTI carries out its supervisory responsibilities using its own staff; the Treasury  on the other hand  while setting the legal framework and policy directions for regulation  leaves most of the detailed regulatory functions to others. Under one piece of legislation - the 1987 Banking Act - the Bank of England carries out prudential supervision of banks. Under another  the 1986 Financial Services Act  the Treasury delegates its powers to the Securities and Investments Board  which in turn recognises a number of front-line regulators. These front-line regulators cover different sections of the market. One  the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA)  is responsible for securities houses; another  the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO)  for fund managers. These two regulators undertake both prudential supervision and conduct of business regulation. The third  the Personal Investments Authority (PIA)  is responsible for the retail sector  and has principally a conduct of business remit although it is responsible for the prudential supervision of independent financial advisers (IFAs). So  in effect  there is a layered approach to the regulation of financial services in the UK  with different powers held at each level. (To complete the picture  the Building Societies Commission supervises building societies (Savings and Loans) - though the largest of them are now converting to bank status. And the Department of Social Security is responsible for the supervision of occupational pension schemes.) This brief description of the legislative framework might lead one to suppose that the UK system is primarily statutory - yet the securities side is often described  at least by comparison with the US system  as one of self-regulation. Indeed  some argue that it is excessively self-regulating and  therefore  unreasonably lax. We would reject that last charge. And  in practice  the distinction between statutory and self-regulation is not black and white. The UK system has elements of both. Prudential supervision of insurance firms is carried out directly by a government ministry  which is unambiguously Government regulation. Banking supervision is carried out by the Bank of England. Constitutionally  this is not ‘Government’ regulation  but rather regulation by a public body which is authorised by specific Act of Parliament. Certainly no one describes what we do as self-regulation  even though the Bank of England is a bank. On the investment side  the picture is more complicated. The Government has delegated its powers to the Securities and Investments Board. The SIB’s governing board includes people who are active in financial services  but they are appointed by the Treasury and the Bank of England (indeed I am one of them) and are required to act in the public interest. Again  this does not look like self-regulation. However  the various front-line regulators are called  in the Act itself  ‘self regulating organisations’ (SROs). Their boards include a high proportion of active practitioners  elected by the industry to represent its views. Practitioners are also heavily involved in policy discussions  rule-making and enforcement functions. But  like the SIB  the SROs operate indirectly under statute  and have a duty to regulate in the public interest. We therefore have no self-regulation in the strict sense  rather a variety of statutory and statute-backed bodies with practitioner involvement  each with different relationships with the industry and with Government. Effective regulation needs the input of all BIS Review 21/1997 - 4 - participants in the market if it is to offer appropriate protection without stifling innovation. Regulators can benefit greatly from effective practitioner input but to retain the confidence of the investing public they must persuade them that regulation puts their interests  and not those of the firms and their shareholders  first. The system we now have is undoubtedly capable of achieving an appropriate balance between market sensitivity and consumer confidence; it has  in many respects  worked well. But it has been stress-tested in a number of difficult episodes: the Maxwell affair  the private pension mis-selling saga  the collapse of BCCI  Barings Bank and Sumitomo. These episodes have taught us something about the strengths and weaknesses of our system  just as the S&L crisis and the Daiwa New York problem have done in the US. Furthermore  markets themselves have moved on. The financial landscape of today is almost unrecognisable from the one which informed legislators’ views in the early 1980s  before the Banking and Financial Services Acts were put on the statute book. It is therefore not surprising that over there  as well as over here  there is criticism of the existing structure  and pressure for change. Our own system  with its monopolistic approach to the origination of legislation  does not generate competing draft bills. But the marketplace for ideas on regulatory reform is  I can assure you  just as well contested. Critics of the existing British system object on three counts: 1 2 3 that the failures of the last decade demonstrate its inability to cope with strains and crises; that it is unnecessarily complex  with overlapping and sometimes even conflicting responsibilities; and that it has failed to keep pace with changes in institutional and market structures; the distinctions on which it was based no longer effectively apply. It is not my aim today to give a comprehensive assessment of the validity of all these arguments. And  in any event  just as in the US  there is a heavy political dimension to this debate. But I would make a few observations on the arguments advanced for change. The UK system is complex  although it is no more complicated than the equivalent arrangements in some other countries with similarly sophisticated financial markets. (Indeed  were I not a guest here  I might say that the US system was rather more labyrinthine than ours.) Those who argue for simplification point to duplication of function and cost  especially between the SIB and the front-line financial services regulators. There is undoubtedly a case to answer in that area  as both the SIB and the SROs would acknowledge. But the legislation we have explicitly dictates a two-tier structure. It is also true that institutions now tend to be involved in a variety of different businesses. Banks own securities houses  fund managers  and insurance companies. Insurance companies are diversifying into banking  and so on. So that even though there should always be a lead regulator  looking at the overall position of the business  institutions still face the costs of complying with the requirements of several regulators. BIS Review 21/1997 - 5 - But the question underlying these arguments about complexity and overlap is more fundamental. Should regulation be based around institutions (it is institutions which fail  after all) or around functions or types of business which call for specialist regulatory knowledge? The UK system is organised neither along wholly functional nor wholly institutional lines. In today’s markets  where firms are a mass of subsidiaries and business units  no major market participant deals with a single regulator across all its businesses. Similarly  no regulator has unique responsibility for regulating one function of each business. The insurance operation of a firm  for example  is covered by separate prudential and conduct of business regulators. Most people involved in financial regulation would recognise this description of the problem. But determining how to resolve it is not straightforward  as evidenced by the wide variety of proposals for change which have been advanced. Some proponents of reorganisation would like to begin by making all financial regulation the responsibility of a single Government Department - the Treasury. They suggest that this would clear up accountability for the legislative framework  and for the powers and sanctions in the regulatory regime and create consistency of regulatory approach across sectors. Straightforward administrative tidiness may also be a factor. While there may be merit in both these arguments  such machinery of Government questions are for the Government to determine  and I happily leave such matters to them. Most of the discussion about regulatory structure in the UK has concentrated on the area covered by the SIB and the front-line financial services regulators. It is in this part of the system that the arguments about duplication of function  unnecessary cost and poor communication are most often heard. The various alternative models all feature some degree of consolidation  and some would go as far as to fold all the main financial services regulators into a single body. Others propose two bodies  each reporting directly to the Treasury  with one covering wholesale business and one covering retail  acknowledging the different regulatory imperatives  especially in the conduct of business field  of the two sectors. The aim would be to reduce the number of domestic regulators large institutions would have to deal with  and to improve the match of regulation to function. Even more radical changes have been proposed  encompassing not only the SIB area  but the prudential supervision of banks and insurance companies as well. One model  colloquially known as ‘Twin Peaks’  would replace the whole of the present system with two Commissions: a Financial Stability Commission  with responsibility for systemic risk  the prudential supervision of all major institutions  and conduct of business regulation of wholesale activities  and a Consumer Protection Commission  which would be in charge of conduct of business regulation in retail markets  as well as detecting market manipulation and insider dealing. It would also carry out prudential supervision of those stock brokers and fund managers who deal with private clients  and of independent intermediaries. The advocates of this model argue that it would better match regulation with both institutions and functions  in particular on the wholesale side. The underlying contention is that the traditional separation between banking  securities and insurance is breaking down  so that there is now a less meaningful difference between institutions and functions. BIS Review 21/1997 - 6 - I am not persuaded of the merits of this case. Although the activities of banks and securities firms do overlap at the margin  this is not true of the core activities. Banks in particular continue to have a number of distinctive characteristics. First  there are the risks associated with the maturity transformation seen in their balance sheets. Banks experiencing a drain in their liquidity  perhaps because of a classic ‘run’  could be driven into insolvency through the forced realisation of illiquid assets at ‘fire-sale’ prices. Second  there is the risk of contagion - problems at one bank can spread to others - not just through direct financial linkages but also because  in the absence of timely  transparent information on bank assets  depositors become concerned about other banks which they see as similar. Finally  banks play a central role in payments systems  including payment flows generated by FX trading. The conclusion I draw is that there is enough that is special about banks for their prudential supervision to be retained as a separate activity in any new regulatory structure  and that this argument at present outweighs the case for change. Whether prudential supervision of banks should be a function of the central bank is a separate question. Some argue that other central banking responsibilities (such as the conduct of monetary policy) make for conflicts of interest and therefore that supervision should not be carried out by the central bank. I am not persuaded by these arguments either. Nor am I aware of many examples where the suggested conflicts between a supervisory role for the central bank and its other responsibilities have arisen in practice. Indeed  there are important synergies between the supervisory function and other central bank responsibilities. It makes sense for the ‘micro’ supervision of individual banks in the system to be carried out by the same body that carries out the ‘macro’ function of maintaining the stability of the financial system as a whole  stability which is essential if monetary policy is to be executed effectively and efficiently. It is no accident that in all major countries the central bank has a significant role in the supervision of banks  even if in some cases others have been given the legal powers to carry out the front-line tasks. Having as supervisors tried their best to limit the likelihood of failure  when faced with it central bankers are uniquely well placed to provide assistance  whether to the institution in trouble  to the market at large  or both. Those who wish to separate banking supervision from central banking must acknowledge that there are certain things that only the central bank can do  and that therefore there needs to be a strong link between the central bank and any new regulator. In Germany  for instance  the Bundesaufsichtsamt is the supervisor of commercial banks. But the Bundesbank has an important role in the day-to-day job of collecting prudential returns  and must be consulted on liquidity and capital requirements  which bear most directly on its role in an emergency. The logic of these arguments might point instead to a ‘Holy Trinity’  rather than a ‘Twin Peaks’ model  based on three agencies  focused respectively on financial services  banking and insurance. That might allow the most sensible match - albeit not complete - of regulation to function and institution. It would also have the advantage of evolving fairly readily out of the present structure. BIS Review 21/1997 - 7 - HM Treasury Insurance Supervisor Insurance Companies Consolidated Securities and Investments Supervisor(s) Bank of England Investment Firms  Markets Banks and Exchanges This last is not a trivial point  since the cost and disruption caused by reorganisation would be considerable  and higher in proportion to the degree of change. The process would inevitably generate uncertainty among firms and the public  and make the regulatory system more difficult to manage in the meantime. This argues for building on the present arrangements  if at all possible  rather than beginning again with an entirely new structure that could take years to settle down. Furthermore  what matters to the financial system  and to the public  is that regulators are effective. Effectiveness necessitates good communication  consolidated supervision and close co-operation to maintain protection across the piece. Whether structural change (including bringing functions improve communication and co-operation and so increase effectiveness  is a key question  and the answer is far from clear. together under one umbrella) would We have been making considerable efforts recently to enhance communication between different supervisors in the UK. That has involved  as you would expect  the usual paraphernalia of Memoranda of Understanding. But  in addition  we have sought to achieve cross-membership of some of our most important institutions. For example  Sir Andrew Large  the Chairman of the Securities and Investments Board  has become a member of the Bank of England’s Board of Banking Supervision and  reciprocally  I have joined the SIB. Of course one should not exaggerate the importance of individual appointments of this kind. But they do help to create a climate of co-operation  and give a signal to the respective staffs of the two institutions that they are expected to work together as closely as possible  and a signal to the outside that they can expect this to happen. The Approach to Regulation in the UK The discussion of regulatory approaches is often phrased in terms of rules versus judgement or  as academics tend to put it  rules versus discretion. Should supervisors simply set BIS Review 21/1997 - 8 - the rules  and shoot those who break them? Or does that create too rigid a framework  one which stifles initiative and imagination? There is no simple answer. The Bank of England imposes an increasing number of rules: it has  for example  implemented detailed regimes for capital adequacy introduced by the Basle Committee and the European Union. We set capital requirements to cover the more readily quantifiable risks; we enforce limits on banks’ large exposures to individual counterparties; we have rules on banks’ liquidity; and we seek to ensure that banks have robust systems and controls  as well as management with the skill and integrity to ensure  in that delightful US phrase  that the bank is ‘safe and sound’. But our judgmental approach - allowing supervisors the discretion to exercise informed judgement within approved guidelines - still contrasts with that of many other regulators. This flexibility allows us to be tough where appropriate  but to avoid inappropriate requirements - tailoring the requirements to the nature of the bank’s activities. Most fundamentally  perhaps  we can ask questions  and attempt to take advantage of all the information at our disposal to form a judgement of the risks facing depositors and investors  as well as of the quality of a bank’s management. So in addition to enforcing rules and looking for problems  we can help management. We can spread knowledge of best practice: asking banks about the full range of risks they face (including those - like reputational and settlement risk - that they would often rather ignore); and pointing out to complex groups the extent to which their managerial and organisational systems have moved away from their legal structure. It is true that  in addition to being less rule-bound than most other supervisors  the Bank is commonly viewed as doing relatively little on-site supervision. Of course  this depends on how you define the term. Accountants are well aware that the Bank does  for example  make extensive use of reports prepared by auditors - who  of course  operate on-site - in order to assess the adequacy of internal controls. In particular  the Bank regularly instructs banks to appoint reporting accountants to report on systems and controls and on the accuracy of prudential returns. The Bank’s supervisors also spend a growing amount of time on-site. Since 1986  Review Teams have carried out focused visits to banks to evaluate the level of risk in an institution as well as the risk management systems in place to identify  monitor  and control these risks. And in 1995 we introduced a Traded Markets Team to focus on banks’ pre-processing models which can be recognised under the CAD (Capital Adequacy Directive) as well as sophisticated risk modelling techniques used by the banks to manage treasury activities. These teams spend on average about three days on banks’ premises  which may seem short  but the visits are highly focused  reflecting a great deal of work carried out in advance  not just between team members and the line supervisors of the bank in question but also by the bank itself in providing detailed answers to a series of questions. At the same time  the Bank has recognised the need to be more systematic in its approach to risk assessment and has announced its intention to introduce a more formal approach based on a common approach  known as the RATE model  to identify - using a series of qualitative and quantitative measures - the risks faced by the bank. RATE is an acronym for the three stages of the process: Risk Assessment  Tools of supervision and Evaluation. BIS Review 21/1997 - 9 - In the future  by performing periodic risk assessments  we aim to gain a better understanding of the quality of management  the characteristics of the business and the risks the banks face. The greater degree of consistency across banks embodied in the new approach will allow the Bank to be more focused in performing its supervision. The tools of supervision  such as Review Team Visits and Reporting Accountants Reports on internal controls  will be targeted at the areas of greater risk and concern in individual banks. We shall very shortly be issuing a consultation paper setting out how we plan to implement the model in practice. That paper will show that we have tried to model parts of our approach on best practice in the US. The City of London may not always have been a preferred habitat for camels  but you may well see some genetically modified examples on the streets there quite soon. A better understanding of the risk profile of each supervised institution will assist the Bank in setting risk asset ratios. As you all know  Basle sets a minimum capital ratio of 8 percent of risk weighted assets. The 8 percent ratio is sometimes interpreted as a ‘one-size-fits- all’ standard. The Bank  however  sets the trigger capital ratio for each authorised bank at  or above  the 8 percent floor and considers an adjustment to that trigger ratio whenever we see a substantial change in that bank’s risk profile. Where does this all leave us in comparison with other regulators? I suggested earlier that our flexible  judgmental approach is somewhat distinctive. But we are no longer  if indeed we ever were  outliers on the supervisory spectrum. While the Bank has decided to implement a more systematic approach to risk assessment  other supervisors - who traditionally operate a rule book - are (in a fast moving marketplace characterised by rapid product innovation) moving towards a regime that gives more scope for supervisory judgement. But the fact that regulators internationally are converging in their approach does not necessarily mean that they are right. They may all be converging on an inappropriate model. Indeed some would argue that regulators do as much to create problems as to solve them: that regulators create perverse incentives - even as we speak bankers may be designing products whose whole rationale is to exploit anomalies in our rules. Perhaps we would all be far better employed elsewhere  leaving the market to regulate itself. Why should we not facilitate that process by concentrating on rules of disclosure  obliging banks to publish accurate information on their capital adequacy and risk profiles  and leaving the rest up to the market - perhaps with some safety net for small depositors and investors? As you know  the New Zealanders have made an interesting move in this direction in the last couple of years. Should we then get out of the business and leave it all to the markets? To answer that question  it may be helpful to go back to first principles. Back in 1958  Modigliani and Miller demonstrated that in a frictionless world a firm’s capital structure cannot affect its value. In the real world  however  departures from the M&M assumptions - such as taxes  bankruptcy costs and agency costs - may influence the capital decision of any firm; capital may after all be costly. But banks differ substantially from most other firms because their soundness and safety is crucial to maintaining systemic stability; without capital requirements some will exploit this fact by taking large risks with little of their money  in the hope that the taxpayer will bail them out. In other words  some may believe that they are (partially) insulated from potential market discipline. From a regulatory perspective  banks must therefore be required to have capital to absorb the possible losses that result from risk-taking and still remain solvent. BIS Review 21/1997 - 10 - What is our position in this debate? It is tempting to conclude that the only problem is a perception of a government-funded safety net for large banks; remove that and our problems will be solved. But systemic risk cannot be wished away as easily as that  even though we in the UK have demonstrated by our actions that we do not rescue every bank which gets into problems. So  while we try to stay clear from ever more detailed rules  we do not believe everything can be left to the market; certain minimum ‘regulatory’ capital standards are in our view necessary. Of course  we must aim for a credible and comprehensible regime which does not require constant updating and elaboration  is not immensely costly  and is reasonably consistent. The value-at-risk approach is an attempt in that direction. It recognises that there is a crucial role for judgement in supervision  and that one size really will not fit all. It does not prescribe the key qualitative factors in legalistic detail. But it does set out the parameters so as to ensure that there is a framework in place which will deliver broad consistency and also some degree of prudence. Some have argued that regulators should go further than the value-at-risk approach: rather than defining the key parameters and endorsing particular model types  why not leave it to the banks  and give them an incentive to improve their internal models as much as possible? Under this pre-commitment approach a bank would specify the maximum portfolio loss on its trading activities and this would become the institution’s market risk capital requirement. Banks exceeding their pre-committed maximum loss (that is breaching their capital commitment) would be penalised in one way or another. Such penalties could be financial  or could entail corrective supervisory action. In some ways pre-commitment can be seen as an extension of the model-approval approach we already adopt. The aim  which we endorse  is to ensure that supervisors work with the grain of the business  and monitor ratios which are seen as meaningful by those who run banks themselves. To that extent  we support it. But there are potential drawbacks. It could amplify the moral hazard problem: if the bank wins  its shareholders - as well as its traders under their bonus packages - pocket the profit  and if it loses  the regulator/tax-payer ends up with the bill. A penalty would not act as a deterrent to a bank prepared to gamble its capital because that bank would not be affected by such a penalty when it was ‘down and out’. Furthermore  regulators could over time become less familiar with banks’ risk management systems  which might make them less effective in a crisis. Early supervisory intervention is more difficult if supervisors only become aware of problems ex-post  after the limit has been breached. It may be possible to devise an approach to pre-commitment which avoids these potential handicaps. But for the time being our attitude remains somewhat hesitant. Finally  a discussion about rules is not complete without touching on the question of a ‘level playing field’; an odd analogy  I think  since in field sports there is no such thing. If there were  why would teams change ends at half time? (In American football  of course  teams change ends three times - and in baseball they resolve the problem by running round in circles.) When banks and securities houses do similar business it seems only fair to apply similar capital rules. But while this is true at the margin  when we look at the total business of banks and securities houses  the picture is still vastly different. A major part of a bank’s regulatory capital is held against credit risk. By contrast  securities houses invest primarily in liquid  marketable assets which can be readily sold  with illiquid assets typically a small BIS Review 21/1997 - 11 - proportion of the total  generally 2% or so  and the bulk of a securities firm’s regulatory capital tends to be maintained for market risk purposes. It is therefore not obvious that we need to set the same detailed rules for banks and securities houses. That is not to say that we should entirely ignore differences in supervisory regimes  but rather that we should focus on areas where those differences are on a scale which seriously distorts competition. In other words  we should spend rather less of our time discussing risk weights  and rather more discussing risks. Globalisation and the Regulatory Response How far do these general principles  which I have discussed so far in relation to the UK  apply to regulatory structures in a global environment? One issue for supervisors is increasing globalisation. The biggest institutions now span 50 or more countries and may have 300 or more entities within the group. This is not new; globalisation in this sense has been a feature of banking certainly since the 1970s. What is rather newer is the way in which the firms are centralising the controls for all these far flung entities. With the recognition that similar risks are being run in different subsidiaries (for example a Japanese bank might have exposure to US interest rate risk from its activities both in London and New York)  there has been a move to consolidate these homogeneous risks and manage them centrally within a group. This means control lines which transcend or cross the entity structures and a matrix management structure. It means that the head office can exercise much stronger control over the volume of a particular type of risk being run across the group. For example  for some UK banks  the management of their global foreign exchange book will be managed in London during London office hours  then it will switch to the US operation but under strict limits set by London; after the US close it will move again  to the Far East  but still under the control of limits set by London. The increasing development of whole book value at risk models has also encouraged this centralisation of control. In the foreign exchange example  the value at risk model used by the group will be maintained and run in London. So the riskiness of positions across the world wide group will be assessed according to the London model. But centralisation of controls goes even further. Oversight of credit and key credit risk decisions may well also be centralised. Oversight of FX settlement risk is sometimes centralised in London as well as control of the position risk. Likewise various aspects of the internal audit function may well be centralised. So for global groups  the control of the activities in the various legal entities scattered across the planet will hinge on the adequacy of controls located not in those particular countries but centrally. In a way it is simply an extension of the vulnerability of banking entities to problems arising elsewhere in the group. But in this case solvency of the individual entities will depend on the adequacy of systems and controls located in another part of the group. Massive intra-group transactions to move risk between entities will also affect the position of the various subsidiaries. One obvious question is why firms do not dispense with such a plethora of legal entities and operate a simpler branch structure. The answer seems to be that differences in tax structures and even regulatory requirements in some countries still encourage the use of legal entities in different jurisdictions. In that case should regulators try to lean against this BIS Review 21/1997 - 12 - centralisation? Here I think the answer must be that the regulators should not try to discourage greater central control of risk. Where a firm is running one type of risk in different locations it must make sense for the total risk to be controlled centrally. But this does create a problem for supervisors because supervision has to be structured along legal entity lines (given that it is legal entities which fail). Responsibility for legal entities cannot be transferred between supervisors. Each supervisor must therefore take a view about the soundness of the entity in its jurisdiction  even where this hinges on controls located elsewhere. How have regulators responded to these trends? In summary  they have increasingly sought ways of increasing co-operation amongst themselves  including agreeing their respective responsibilities and setting up arrangements for information sharing. In the banking sector  at least  they have also supplemented solo supervision of individual entities with consolidated supervision of groups as a whole. When the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision was established by the central bank governors of the G10 countries at the end of 1974  its initial focus was to define the role and responsibilities of home and host supervisors of internationally active banks. These were set out in the 1975 Concordat which established how supervisory responsibility for banks’ foreign branches and subsidiaries should be shared between host and parent supervisors  and which has been updated on a number of occasions since. Securities supervisors too have a long tradition of international co-operation  including arrangements for information sharing and mutual assistance in enforcement  with IOSCO playing a key role in facilitating such co-operation internationally. There is also a long history of discussion between Basle and IOSCO. Individual supervisors in both the banking and securities industries have chosen to reinforce co-operation arrangements with formal bilateral agreements with their overseas counterparts. Partly as a consequence  there have been an increasing number of informal meetings between line supervisors with operational responsibility for different parts of financial groups. The importance of international regulatory co-operation is now widely acknowledged and is on the agenda of inter-governmental meetings. At last June’s G7 summit in Lyon  the heads of state called for maximum progress preceding the Denver summit in June 1997 on “enhancing co-operation among the authorities responsible for supervision of internationally active institutions  importantly by clarifying their roles and responsibilities.” Ahead of the Lyon Summit  Basle and IOSCO had announced a joint initiative to strengthen co- operation in this area  referring to the work of the Joint Forum of banking  securities and insurance supervisors  which was set up to promote information exchange on international financial conglomerates  and consider establishing for each a lead regulator. The need for the international regulatory community to address successfully the challenge of supervising multi-functional global financial conglomerates is an issue of particular significance to the UK. This is because of the international nature of the London markets - uniquely so amongst the world’s major financial centres. The failure of one or more major overseas firms may cause systemic problems in London where at the end of last year  overseas banks accounted for 57% of the total assets of the UK monetary sector  with US banks contributing 8%. Furthermore  almost three quarters of the 478 banks which take deposits in the BIS Review 21/1997 - 13 - UK are branches or subsidiaries of overseas financial institutions  including 37 from the US. US firms have  of course  particular importance in certain markets. Our April 1995 derivatives survey showed US firms (including securities houses) accounting for around 40% of turnover in both foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives. We therefore attach particular importance to international regulatory co- operation; and as the trend towards globalisation and multi-functionality continues it is becoming increasingly necessary. The Barings and Daiwa cases have highlighted the difficulty that banks can experience in controlling operations which are far from their head offices. Barings  in particular  demonstrated that losses in a subsidiary in a remote location  in a unit which was not thought to be assuming any significant market risk  can be big enough to bring about the failure of the parent. So home and host supervisors have a mutual interest in the health of the subsidiaries. Regulators will rightly be blamed if any reluctance on their part to work together either exacerbates a crisis or fails to prevent one that could otherwise have been avoided. It is possible to argue that an individual regulator can successfully meet his own objectives  by seeking to build firewalls between his entity and the rest of the group to which it belongs. These might include restrictions or even prohibitions on both financial exposures and operational interlinkages. In addition capital adequacy and other requirements might be set at a more onerous level than if the potential for parental support was taken into account. Such measures may be the best that can be achieved at present; they certainly provide host supervisors with a measure of comfort. But they are  and always will be  a second best. There will always  for example  be a risk of reputational contagion. Counterparties might refuse to deal with a member of a failed group because they are unwilling to take the risk that the firewalls may be flawed  or that cultural or control weaknesses which led to the failure are repeated in that entity also. This  of course  is a hypothetical risk but one which does concern supervisors. Secondly  as the firm will incur additional costs in order to comply with these ring- fencing arrangements  while possibly at the same time being denied the risk reducing benefits of group wide controls  it is unlikely to provide the most efficient solution. Concern about these deficiencies has heightened as we have learned more about the way in which many global financial groups are managed. The lack of overlap between legal entities and the management of business lines means that the amount of true ring-fencing which is possible for a globally managed institution is open to debate. The creation of ring-fenced islands of activity seems to me contrary both to the trend in markets and second-best in terms of regulatory efficiency. The Bank of England has always believed that effective supervision of financial groups must involve consolidated supervision. As Alan Greenspan said last week in his testimony to the Congressional Sub- Committee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit  “Risks managed on a consolidated basis cannot be reviewed on an individual legal entity basis by different supervisors”. It is important to define the term “consolidated supervision”. The underlying philosophy is that for  say  a bank operating in a large financial group  it is necessary to look not only at the soundness of the bank itself but also of the group as a whole. This will require both a quantitative and a qualitative assessment. The quantitative element involves examining the financial strength of the whole group. The basic measures here are capital adequacy and large BIS Review 21/1997 - 14 - exposures. In the Bank of England  we look at these against the minimum standards set out in the EU Directives and against the more stringent criteria which we have developed ourselves and apply to individual banking groups in ways that take account of their particular circumstances. It is worth noting that both the EU Directives and the Basle Capital Accord set these minimum standards on a consolidated basis only. The qualitative element involves assessing factors such as the group’s risk management process  internal systems and controls  capability of key personnel  culture and business strategy. Any supervisor will hardly need reminding that  in the Barings case  weaknesses in a subsidiary in just these areas brought about the collapse of the parent. As the need for consolidated supervision is written into the Basle Concordat we can be confident that all regulators of internationally active commercial banks  including of course those in the US  subscribe to its principles. Consolidated supervision is a relatively widely understood concept involving the range of activities set out above. Alan Greenspan last week talked of “umbrella supervision”  which he described as a “realistic necessity for the protection of our financial system”. (Of course we are not experts on umbrellas: it rarely rains in London  as you know.) But I also referred earlier to a “lead regulator” - though the term ‘co-ordinating supervisor’ is gaining currency in some quarters. As noted  one of the tasks of the Joint Forum is to define the role of such a person. So far there have been extensive discussions of the role. Among the possibilities suggested have been: Carrying out a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the group as a whole. (This is the consolidated supervisor’s role and  where there is already a consolidated supervisor  the lead regulator would normally be the same body); b) c) Taking a primary role in managing emergencies should they arise; Acting to facilitate the exchange of information between the relevant regulators in a group; d) (In the longer term) considering ways in which supervisors’ efforts could be better co-ordinated when looking at (e.g.) controls. It should be stressed that the existence of either a lead regulator or a consolidated supervisor in no way affects the legal responsibilities of the individual regulatory authorities which are responsible for regulating the different entities within the group. The objective is not to shift the balance of supervisory responsibility from host to home supervisors. Rather  the intention is that each host authority should be able to carry out these responsibilities more effectively by relying to some extent on the work of others. It cannot possibly make sense for  say  30 different supervisors to crawl over the controls centralised and concentrated in one location? We are keen to examine the practicability of allowing one co-ordinator to carry out the role defined above. Enthusiasm from the US has been more muted  although commercial BIS Review 21/1997 - 15 - banks are  of course  already subjected to consolidated supervision. Here I know there are political issues at stake too  and any foreigner is well advised to tread carefully. I would hope  nevertheless  that these important issues can be considered carefully. More problematic is the position of the US investment banking groups who  uniquely amongst the banking and securities industries in major countries  are not subject to legislation requiring consolidated supervision. Some have banking subsidiaries in the UK  owned by companies established under Article XII of the New York State Banking Act. Accordingly these companies and their UK subsidiaries are subject to consolidated supervision by the New York State Banking Department. The involvement of a home country supervisor in this way gives us a degree of comfort which allows the ring-fencing to be less stringent than it would otherwise be. However this clearly falls a long way short of comprehensive consolidated supervision of the entire investment banking group. There is a lively debate in the US at the moment about the most appropriate regulatory structure for all financial institutions  and particularly for investment banks. This tends to be regarded in the US largely as an internal matter. But the fact that the large US financial institutions have a global reach inevitably makes that debate a matter of great interest and concern to the international financial community. We are optimistic that legislation will soon be enacted to address these concerns. It would certainly be disappointing if it is not. Conclusions Though I have attempted this morning to identify some features of regulation on which we might well agree  I doubt whether there is such a thing as an ‘optimal’ regulatory structure. Each country has its own legacy of supervisory structures and approaches. But an appropriate international structure is one which works as seamlessly as possible and has clear lines of responsibility (at least  that is what we expect from international banking groups’ controls). One co-ordinating regulator for each institution could play a crucial role in such a structure. The question of the number of regulators is  in my view  less important; no one has yet suggested we set up one body world-wide to carry out all supervision  so whatever our own vision of an optimal regulatory structure  it will have at its centre a requirement for supervisors from different disciplines and in different countries to communicate effectively with one another. This weekend’s conference is a good opportunity to do that. BIS Review 21/1997

Phillips  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the Annual Washington Conference of the Institute of International Bankers on 3/3/97. I am pleased to have the opportunity to address this group at a time when developments in global financial markets are presenting particular challenges for market participants and market regulators alike. I was asked to talk with you today about both developments in Federal Reserve supervision and regulation  as well as the approaches to financial modernization being debated in the Congress. I won’t try to cover the full waterfront on these topics  but would like to share with you some of the Board’s considerable rethinking about the way we supervise and regulate bank holding companies. I will also describe how I believe the recent Board initiatives coming out of this process may well alter the debate about the structure and supervision of financial services in the United States -- a topic I believe has received insufficient attention in the legislative debate so far. I will focus my discussion of recent Board actions on the supervisory process and on three regulatory changes made or proposed by the Board: changes to the application and nonbanking provisions of Regulation Y  changes and proposed changes to the Board-imposed “firewalls” between a bank and a securities affiliate  and changes to the Board’s anti-tying rules. I stress these three not necessarily because they are the most important undertaken by the Board  but because I believe that they most directly affect the debate about how financial services should be supervised. Supervisory Changes The cornerstone of the bank supervisory process is the verification of prudent practices and financial condition through on-site examinations  coupled with off-site surveillance. Traditionally  on-site examinations of bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries have focused on verifying compliance and determining the financial condition of an institution at the time of the examination by reviewing their loans and by testing other transactions. This process is changing. The Federal Reserve’s supervisory oversight at the bank holding company level is increasingly directed at evaluating risk management  internal controls  and decision making processes that are shared between a bank and its parent  rather than focusing on transactions and positions at nonbank affiliates. This focus is necessary given the continuing trend toward integrated management of financial activities on a consolidated basis. Testing the adequacy of risk management and internal control helps us understand the financial condition of the consolidated organization and the potential impact of consolidated risk management policies and internal controls on the operations of the insured depository institution. To implement this approach  the Federal Reserve last year began assigning a formal rating to risk management in our holding company and bank examination reports. Changes have come not just in what we examine  but also in how we examine. We are making greater use of internal risk management reports  the results of internal risk models  and the work of internal and external auditors. For example  the Federal Reserve is now collecting internal loan classification reports prepared by most of our larger banks  as well as BIS Review 24/1997 - 2 - other information generated by their internal risk management systems. This approach has a further advantage in that it can generally be conducted off-site  at less burden to the firm. Our examinations are also becoming more efficient through pre-visitation planning that better identifies those areas of a company’s activities that pose the greatest risk. We are also making greater use of computer technology in the examination process and using automated systems that permit examiners to analyze data on their personal computers. And  of course  whenever possible we rely upon examination and inspection reports prepared by regulators of the individual entities within the bank holding company. Like examinations  disclosure practices of the past also focused narrowly on the financial condition of an institution at a point in time  using conventional accounting and regulatory measures. Today  however  disclosures are expanding to reveal not only the current risks of the balance sheet  but also management’s philosophy for managing and controlling risk. Disclosure is an important aid to us as supervisors and  we hope  to market analysts. Improved disclosure has already been put into practice for derivatives and market risks  and we will continue to urge better and more broadly based disclosure of all major activities and exposures. The Effect of Supervisory Changes on Legislation As the issue of consolidated or “umbrella” supervision is debated in the legislative process  I believe it is important to examine how these supervisory developments alter that debate. There are those who argue that umbrella supervision of a diverse financial services holding company would either be an impossible task or an intolerable burden. But the risk-analysis and surveillance techniques that we have decided are the most effective for bank holding companies should also be adaptable to more diverse financial organizations that include banking operations. Clearly  we must all give additional thought to how such an adaptation would work so that we minimize the intrusion into new activities. Perhaps there should be some kind of carve-out for firms whose banking operations are a small part of the organization or if the firm is otherwise regulated. Nevertheless  to be successful  a financial services company should reap synergy gains not only by marketing a variety of products to customers but also by pooling and jointly managing diverse financial risks. Thus  the movement toward use of one treasury  one risk management policy  and one set of exposure limits would continue. It is those policies and risks that an umbrella supervisor must understand in order to gauge the risks to the insured institution. In fact  as I am sure this group will recall in the wake of BCCI  the Congress also became convinced of the importance of consolidated supervision of any banking organization. Through the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act  the United States not only recognized the importance of consolidated supervision  but strongly encouraged it as an international principle of banking supervision by requiring that any foreign bank seeking to enter the United States be subject to consolidated home country supervision. Subsequent history has confirmed that judgment. As I’ve noted  virtually all of the large holding companies now operate as integrated units and are managed as such. Thus  the Federal Reserve remains convinced that one supervisor must have the task of evaluating the organization as a whole. BIS Review 24/1997 - 3 - This view is now commonly accepted around the world. The idea has for some time been endorsed by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision  and many countries are adopting similar approaches. Still  I can certainly understand why some advocates of a more diversified financial services holding company would wish to abandon consolidated supervision. Consolidated supervision raises hard questions -- the kind of questions that can bog down legislation and splinter coalitions -- and questions that engage us even now. What authority should a consolidated supervisor have over non-financial activities  if they are allowed? How should the consolidated supervisor work with the primary supervisor of a bank  or a broker-dealer  or an insurance company? How much burden must consolidated supervision entail? As we all pursue the answers to these questions  perhaps the Federal Reserve’s risk-based approach to supervision can provide insights into how umbrella supervision of an expanded organization could work. Regulatory Changes Just as with supervision  the regulatory side of the Federal Reserve has undergone profound changes of late. Just a few weeks ago  the Board approved a comprehensive streamlining of Regulation Y that should substantially diminish the regulatory burden on bank holding companies and foreign banks wishing to expand or innovate in the United States. First  the Board concluded that review of an application should focus on how the proposed acquisition or activity would affect the organization. The application should not become a vehicle for comprehensively evaluating and addressing supervisory and compliance issues at the applicant organization. This principle is also the basis for recent Congressional action to eliminate the prior approval requirement for engaging in Board-approved nonbanking activities under section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act  provided the company meets specified standards for capital and management at the time of its last examination. As a result  the Board has significantly streamlined the process for well-capitalized  well-run companies to acquire a bank or nonbank and eliminated the prior approval process for such companies to engage de novo in Board-approved nonbanking activities. Second  the Board concluded that bank holding companies should be permitted to conduct nonbanking activities to the fullest extent permissible under the Bank Holding Company Act  and that Regulation Y should be sufficiently flexible to allow for industry changes in permissible activities without requiring additional regulatory filings. Accordingly  the Board removed restrictions on investment advisory activities  derivatives trading activities  leasing  and other activities whenever those restrictions impeded efficiency or imposed costs without conferring corresponding benefits to safety and soundness. The Board also permitted a data processing or management consulting subsidiary to derive up to 30 percent of its revenue from nonfinancial data processing or nonfinancial management consulting. And the Board has indicated that it will be pro-active in approving new activities. The next area where the Board has been particularly active concerns firewalls between a bank and an affiliated securities firm  better known as a section 20 affiliate. BIS Review 24/1997 - 4 - Experience with these section 20 affiliates  and other affiliates engaging in similar activities without such restrictions  led the Board to conduct a comprehensive review of the firewalls. Much of the potential for conflicts of interest between a bank and a securities firm is addressed by other laws such as the registration and disclosure requirements and the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws. Legislative and regulatory enactments  many adopted since the Board’s initial 1987 section 20 order  also provide important insulation between a bank and a section 20 affiliate by imposing qualitative and quantitative limits on inter-affiliate transactions and requiring that a customer receive disclosures detailing the identity of its counterparty and the product being purchased. Accordingly  the Board has repealed its restriction on cross-marketing between a bank and a section 20 affiliate  eliminated a blanket restriction on employee interlocks  and scaled back a blanket restriction on officer interlocks to include only a chief executive officer. The Board has also proposed to eliminate a firewall prohibiting a bank from providing any funding to a section 20 affiliate and three restrictions on a bank’s extending credit or offering credit enhancements in support of securities being underwritten by its section 20 affiliate. The Board’s proposal recognized that as financial intermediation has evolved  corporate customers frequently seek to obtain a variety of funding mechanisms from one source. By prohibiting banks from providing routine credit enhancements in tandem with a section 20 affiliate  the existing firewalls hamper the ability of bank holding companies to operate as one-stop financial services providers  thereby reducing options for customers. Instead  the Board has proposed to require that internal controls and operating standards ensure that a bank use independent credit judgment whenever it is acting in tandem with its section 20 affiliate. Finally  the Board has taken action to allow greater packaging of products by bank holding companies. Since the 1970s  banks and bank holding companies have been prohibited from packaging their products unless the arrangement involved a traditional bank product. While this exception softened the impact of the statute  bank holding companies were nonetheless at a considerable disadvantage to their competitors  particularly as bundling of services has become a marketing imperative on both the retail and wholesale side of the business. After reviewing its experience with the statute  the Board recently repealed a regulation that had extended to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries the statutory prohibition on tying arrangements by banks. Experience taught us that these non-banks did not have the type of market power that Congress presumed banks possessed when it enacted an anti-tying statute. The Board has also created exceptions to the statute to allow package arrangements between bank holding company affiliates to the same extent as the statute allows them within the bank. Lastly  and perhaps of greatest interest to you  the Board created a safe harbor to clarify that any transaction with a foreign customer was not covered by the statute. Thus  for example  a U.S. branch of a foreign bank can participate in a syndicated loan to a European firm  even if the loan is offered only as part of a package of services that would otherwise run afoul of the anti-tying law. The Effect of the Regulatory Climate on Legislation I think it worth noting how all these reforms may affect the debate about the BIS Review 24/1997 - 5 - corporate structure of bank holding companies -- specifically whether bank holding companies should be granted the option of moving activities prohibited to the bank into a subsidiary of the bank  and thereby funding those activities with subsidized funds. Descriptions of how the subsidy works and examples of the funding advantages it confers are plentiful. But I believe that it is so ingrained in our thinking that we sometimes take it for granted. Think how obvious the subsidy would be if it involved another industry -- for example  if the government guaranteed that commercial paper holders of the automobile industry would be repaid in full. To complete the other strands of the safety net -- the discount window and the payment system -- let us assume that automobile companies experiencing liquidity problems could borrow from the Federal Reserve for the purpose of repaying commercial paper  and that they are able to achieve risk-free settlement. The effects of extending such a subsidy are not difficult to imagine. Automakers would find it very easy to place their commercial paper  and would be able to pay a below-market yield. And  to the extent the hypothetical allowed  I would not be surprised to see automakers use this funding advantage to enter other businesses. So it is with banks -- and with subsidiaries of banks. Regulators can limit a bank’s ability to subsidize its subsidiary through loans by capping their amount or regulating the rates the subsidiary must pay. But although one can limit the aggregate investment a bank can make in its subsidiary by requiring that such injections be deducted from the capital of the bank  the equity investment in the subsidiary is still funded from subsidized resources  and that subsidy transfer cannot be eliminated. Thus  both analytically and practically  I think it difficult to deny that banks and their subsidiaries benefit from a federal subsidy  and benefit in ways that an affiliate of the bank does not. Nevertheless  some argue that a parent-subsidiary structure is more efficient than a sibling structure  and must be allowed for a broader range of activities. But in light of the recent regulatory changes that I have described  I believe that this argument is now questionable. A bank and an affiliate can now avoid a redundant work force and duplication of effort by having employees serve in a dual capacity  or by allowing reporting lines to cross. For example  a common back office or treasury can be maintained. Furthermore  the two companies can market their products jointly to both retail and corporate customers. With these regulatory changes  banks and bank holding companies have opportunities to make considerable adjustments to their organizational structures and operating procedures as well as to offer new products to customers in new ways. Conclusion Let me conclude by pointing out that the legislative debate has only just begun. Opinions are still developing  new ideas are still being presented  and positions are not yet cast in concrete. But even as new legislation is being debated  those of us who must try to interpret and administer existing laws recognize that we must do so in a developing global marketplace. I believe that the steps the Board has taken to make its regulatory and supervisory systems less burdensome and more risk focused will stand us in good stead in this changing financial environment. Nevertheless  comprehensive financial reform legislation is still needed to allow banking and other financial institutions to compete internationally and to offer the full range of financial services needed and demanded by their customers.

The mandate to the South African Reserve Bank The South African Reserve Bank was established in 1921 in terms of a special Act of Parliament. At that time  central banks existed mainly in Europe  and the SA Reserve Bank was only the fourth central bank founded outside Europe. There already existed central banks in the United States of America  Japan and Java. Since its establishment  the Reserve Bank was always privately owned. Today  the Bank has more than 700 shareholders. The shares of the Bank are listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and  in terms of the Act  no individual shareholder is allowed to hold more than one-half per cent of the capital of the Bank. The Bank may also never pay a dividend of more than 10 per cent per annum on the nominal value of its capital. The market price of the share therefore behaves like a government bond with a 10 per cent coupon. The Bank is managed by a Board of 14 Directors  seven of whom are elected by the shareholders to represent them on the Board. Without holding any shares in the Bank  the Government (President) has the right to appoint the other seven Board members. The seven appointed by the President includes the Governor and three Deputy Governors  who are full-time executive members  plus three part-time Directors. The functions of the Bank changed over time. When the Bank was originally established in 1921  its main task was to develop money and capital markets and a banking system in South Africa that would be independent of London. Today its main task  as defined in terms of the South African Reserve Bank Act and in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa  is to defend the value of the rand  that is  to keep inflation as low as possible. This is very much in line with contemporary central banking all over the world. Since 1980  most central banks have accepted a similar mission. The latest example is perhaps the People’s Bank of China  whose mandate has been changed as from March 1995 to maintain the stability of the Chinese yuan  and in this way to promote economic growth. The Board of the Reserve Bank has been given an important degree of autonomy for the execution of its duties. In terms of the Constitution: “The South African Reserve Bank  in pursuit of its primary objective  must perform its functions independently and without fear  favour or prejudice  but there must be regular consultation between the Bank and the Cabinet member responsible for national financial matters”. In terms of Section 32 of the Reserve Bank Act  the Bank must submit a monthly statement of its assets and liabilities and an annual report to Parliament. The Bank is therefore accountable to Parliament. The Governor of the Reserve Bank holds regular discussions with the Minister of Finance  and appears before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance from time to time. The Board of the Bank has delegated its powers on important monetary policy decisions to a sub-committee of the Board  known as the Governors’ Committee and comprising the Governor and three Deputy Governors. There is also an Audit Committee and a Human BIS Review 24/1997 - 2 - Resources Committee of the Board that meet regularly on aspects of internal finance and administration. The full Board meets four times a year. The Bank has a total staff of about 1900 people and operates from its Head Office in Pretoria and seven branches maintained in the major cities of South Africa. 2. Why must inflation be controlled? The main task of the Reserve Bank is to protect the value of the currency. The business of a modern central bank is the business of money. Central banks are given the right to issue money by their governments. That is why the Reserve Bank is accountable to Parliament and why its surplus profits are paid over to the Treasury. The right to issue money (bank notes and coin) makes the central bank a very powerful institution that can easily be misused for sectoral interests. That is why it must be able to act in the national interest -- what is good for the total economy is important  and not what any specific group or sector may desire. In modern sophisticated financial systems  surrogates for real money (bank notes and coin) developed  such as bank cheque accounts  credit cards and electronic transfers. Private banking institutions now create more money (means of payment) than the central bank. In order to fulfil its task of protecting the value of the currency  the Reserve Bank must therefore also have some powers to control the money creation capacity of the banking sector. In South Africa today  bank notes and coin in circulation account for less than 5 per cent of the money supply. The rest is money created by banking institutions over which the Reserve Bank has but an indirect control. Money serves the purpose of a means of payment. It is also a unit of account in terms of which the value of goods and services are measured. It serves thirdly as a store of value for the savings of the community. These three functions of money make it essential that the value of money shall remain as stable as possible. No modern market-oriented economy can function well if the value of its currency is not kept stable. Inflation is a continuous decline in the value of money. This will be reflected in a continuous rise in the prices of goods and services. In a market economy  certain prices of specific goods and services will always change to reflect changes in underlying forces of demand and supply. It is indeed essential that relative prices of goods and services will change in a market economy to bring about equilibrium and support maximum economic growth. It becomes a problem for the efficient functioning of the economy if all prices generally increase over time  because this will confuse the signals emitted by the market system through the mechanism of relative price changes. The many disadvantages of inflation therefore include: the distortion of the efficient working of the market system through its disruptive effects on the price mechanism; a reduction in the usefulness of money as a unit of account. You cannot properly measure and compare values of goods and services if you have to use a variable or elastic yardstick; and an erosion of the value of money as a store of wealth. Savers will not be prepared to accumulate wealth in an asset that loses its value over time. Because of these effects of a decline in the value of money  high rates of inflation inevitably lead to a decline in the efficiency of the market economy  a decline in savings and  in the longer term  a lower rate of growth for the economy as a whole. Other more direct disadvantages of inflation can be summarised as follows: BIS Review 24/1997 - 3 - People with fixed incomes  for example salaries or pensions  are affected more by inflation than the wealthy who can partly protect themselves against inflation  for example by investing in property or equities. Inflation therefore leads to an increase in the disparity between the “haves” and the “have-nots”. Inflation makes forward planning more difficult. A person may  for example  save for his whole working life for a pension  just to find at the end of his career that his savings have been eroded by inflation. Inflation in one country at a level higher than inflation in other countries create many difficulties for international financial relations. The exchange rate of the country that becomes out of line because of this difference  must depreciate continuously to keep local industries and other producers (e.g. gold mines) competitive. Depreciation in itself can lead to more inflation and a vicious circle of more-inflation-more-depreciation can easily get out of control and destroy the whole economy. Inflation is inclined to feed on itself. It is almost impossible to keep a little bit of inflation always just a little bit. As long as there is inflation in the economy  monetary authorities must remain on their guard. Even if relatively low inflation can be tolerated  there is always a danger that the rate of price rises will increase. Because of all these adverse characteristics of inflation  this illness of the market economy often leads to serious social disruption which brings with it political instability. It is therefore in the interest of the economy  the social structure and the political system that a government and its people shall always be prepared and ready to fight inflation. 3. The causes of inflation Inflation is a rather complex phenomenon of the economy. There is no single cause of inflation. It can find its origin in the rest of the world  and can therefore be imported from abroad. It can be caused by excess demand  that is  by a desire of an economy to absorb more goods and services than it can afford to supply (from domestic production plus imports). The excessive demand can emanate from government expenditure  private sector consumption expenditure  or even fixed investment. It can be caused by wage increases in excess of productivity rises that will lead to an increase in the labour cost per unit of production. It can be generated by monopolistic practices that can be misused to generate surplus profits for entrepreneurs. Whatever the basic causes of inflation might be  it is normally accompanied or accommodated by excessive increases in the money supply. Indeed  inflation may often find its origin in excessive increases in the money supply when monetary policy is used as a deliberate instrument to provide artificial stimulation to the economy. In any national programme to keep inflation down  the control of the money supply must be included as an indispensable component of the total package. Restricting the growth in the money supply will make it impossible for inflationary impulses  even of a non-monetary origin  to escalate and permeate in continuous price rises. In the South African economy  there are many inflationary forces at work at all times. The task of the South African Reserve Bank is therefore not an easy one. Because of these many inflationary forces  the Bank must apply a policy that at times seems to be over-restrictive -- an approach that is necessary in order to neutralise the inflationary effects of many non-monetary actions that are exerting upward pressure on prices all the time. BIS Review 24/1997 4. The monetary policy model of the Reserve Bank - 4 - Most central banks in the world pursue the same prime objective of protecting the value of their currencies. Not all central banks  however  follow the same model in the implementation of monetary policy. The Reserve Bank’s policy is a “monetarist” approach based on the direct control of the money supply. Controlling the money supply is seen as an intermediate objective in reaching the ultimate objective of controlling inflation. Some countries target inflation directly in the monetary policy model. Taking account of the many causes of inflation  direct targeting of inflation requires broad co-ordination of macroeconomic policies such as fiscal policy  trade and industrial policies  labour policies  and international economic relations policies. It should indeed be based on a broad accord of a consistent macroeconomic policy framework that will support the need for keeping inflation down. Low inflation is no guarantee for higher economic growth and development  but it is an important precondition for attaining better standards of living for all the people of the country on a sustainable basis. In some other countries  monetary policy is anchored to a fixed or stable exchange rate formula  instead of to the money supply. This is perhaps good for countries with a relatively open economy (such as South Africa is now becoming). It is a precondition for the successful implementation of this type of model that the country will be able to stabilise the exchange rate through regular intervention in the foreign exchange market. To begin with  the central bank must have access to a substantial amount of foreign reserves to enable it to intervene in the market for foreign exchange in a meaningful way. The South African model for monetary policy is  however  based on controlling the money supply. Within the family of monetarists  there will always be differences of opinion on what the most appropriate definition is for the money supply  on how this money supply should best be controlled  on when and how actions by the central bank must be triggered  etcetera. The basic objective remains  however  to keep the rate of increase in the money supply within reasonable limits. The Reserve Bank’s policy is seen to be rather accommodative and does not comply with the strict money rule of not tolerating any inflation. Guidelines for an acceptable rate of increase in the M3 money supply are announced at the beginning of each year on what growth in the money supply will be good or tolerable in the South African economy. For 1996  guidelines were set at between 6 and 10 per cent  providing for real growth of 3 to 4 per cent  and inflation of 6 to 7 per cent. Pure monetarists would have required growth in the money supply of not more than 4 per cent (the growth in the real economy in a similar situation). The money supply guidelines set by the Reserve Bank should not be seen as targets that must be achieved at all cost. They only serve as guidelines and contribute towards making monetary policy more transparent. As long as the actual growth in the money supply exceeds the guidelines  monetary policy must remain restrictive. Scope for an easier monetary policy develops only as and when actual growth in the money supply moves to within the guideline range. As previously indicated  money is created in South Africa mainly through the actions of private banking institutions. When they give credit to their clients  they create money. The Reserve Bank’s obligation to control the money supply  therefore  extends to a control over the total amount of new credit extended by banking institutions. BIS Review 24/1997 - 5 - The rate of increase in the total amount of bank credit outstanding is determined by two sides of a market formula: the amount of credit that banks can supply at any time  and the total demand of funds emanating from the borrowers of funds. The supply side of the formula depends on how much liquidity the banks have at their disposal for funding their lending operations. The Reserve Bank therefore has a vested interest in influencing or managing the amount of liquidity available to the banks. The Reserve Bank has a number of instruments at its disposal to influence the liquidity of the banking system  such as open-market operations  discount window facilities  and cash reserve requirements. The demand side of the formula is very much interest rate driven. Higher interest rates will depress the demand  and lower interest rates will increase demand. The level of interest rates is to an important extent determined by forces of demand and supply operating through financial markets  but can also be influenced by the Reserve Bank’s own intervention in the markets. To meet its obligation of controlling the money supply  the Reserve Bank must ensure that the amount of liquidity available in the banking system and the level of interest rates will be such that there will be no excessive increase in the money supply. Excessive increases in the money supply will eventually  after a time lag which can be as long as two years  accommodate rising  or cause higher  inflation with all the disadvantages thereof. Interest rates therefore play a vital role in the fight against inflation. It is one of the main operational instruments used by central banks to ensure an acceptable rate of growth in the money supply. In summary  the monetary policy model followed by the Reserve Bank can be seen as follows: To support maximum sustainable economic growth and development; the rate of inflation must be kept low (the value of the currency must be protected); to achieve this objective  the rate of growth in the money supply must be kept within an acceptable range (the guidelines); as money is created  mainly through bank credit extension  monetary policy must be directed towards some control over bank credit extension  which requires some management of the amount of funds available in the banking system  and a consistent interest rate policy. If this model is applied consistently and with success  the rate of inflation will be low  which will lead to a more stable exchange rate of the rand. The exchange rate therefore becomes a result of the model and not a starting point. In such an environment of overall financial stability  it will be possible to achieve and sustain a maximum real rate of growth and development in the economy. 5. Successes achieved in the past The present model of monetary policy was designed by the Commission of Inquiry into the Monetary System and Monetary Policy (De Kock Commission) during the course of the 1980’s and was implemented in South Africa more vigorously since 1989. The results achieved since then can be summarised as follows: In 1988 total credit extended to the private sector increased by 28 per cent which was  of course  far out of line with growth in the nominal value of the total gross domestic BIS Review 24/1997 - 6 - production of South Africa. The M3 money supply increased by 27 per cent and released massive inflationary pressures in the economy. Through a continuous and consistent restrictive monetary policy  the rate of increase in bank credit extension was gradually reduced  and in 1992 and 1993 it dropped below 10 per cent per annum. The rate of increase in the money supply also declined to 8 per cent in 1992 and 7 per cent in 1993. The rate of inflation followed and declined to below 10 per cent for the first time in 20 years in 1993. For the past four years  the average annual rate of inflation has now stayed below the 10 per cent level  and last year inflation of 7.4 per cent (average for the twelve months) represented the lowest annual average rate of inflation in South Africa for the past 24 years. Ominous signs developed over the past two years  however  with the rate of increase in bank credit extension escalating again to 18.7 per cent in June 1996. The rate of increase in the M3 money supply also rose to 16 per cent in October 1996  while inflation gradually crept up from a low of 5.5 per cent over the twelve months up to April 1996  to 9.4 per cent over the twelve months up to December 1996. The current stimulus for inflation emanated mainly from the depreciation of the rand last year  but there is a danger that  if not checked at this stage  it could easily be converted into a new cycle of a continuous rise in the rate of inflation. The Reserve Bank was therefore forced once again during the past year to pursue a more restrictive monetary policy that led to an increase of approximately 3 percentage points in the level of interest rates. Towards the end of 1996  the more restrictive policies began to produce results when both the rates of increase in bank credit extension and in the money supply slowed down. Over the twelve months up to December 1996  bank credit extension to the private sector rose by 15.7 per cent  and the M3 money supply by 13.7 per cent  both marginally down from the peaks established earlier in the year. Inflation is  however  still creeping upwards and it will take some time before the full effect of the depreciation of the rand will work itself out. In the meantime  it is of great importance that all other inflationary impulses in the economy  such as excessive rises in government expenditure or real wage rises in excess of productivity increases  and of course  a continuation of the excessive rates of increase in the monetary aggregates  must be avoided. The depreciation of the rand can bring many benefits for economic growth and development  provided the advantages for international competitiveness will not be dissipated very quickly by rising costs of production and a rising rate of inflation in the domestic economy. The year 1997 is indeed a testing period for the Reserve Bank and for the monetary policy applied by the Bank. Should the Bank fail in its efforts to protect the value of the currency at this stage  the goals set by Government for economic reconstruction and development  and the implementation of the Government’s Strategy for Growth  Employment and Redistribution will not be attainable.

In recent years  however  a number of financial institutions have come to focus on disclosure of a wider range of information  including their management policies. This is partly attributable to the expansion of derivatives transactions  which has made risk management techniques increasingly important in the management of financial institutions  and which has thereby encouraged financial institutions to improve such techniques. Accordingly  individual financial institutions have been motivated to reveal voluntarily their risk exposures and risk management methods in order to win a favorable assessment from market participants. Disclosure thus brings into play a check mechanism inherent in financial markets (hereafter referred to as the market check mechanism) that disciplines management of financial institutions  and thereby helps to enhance the efficiency and transparency of the markets and to stabilize the financial system. This report examines the disclosure of information on risks of financial institutions  with an overview of the current practices and future issues. It is intended to serve market participants  the beneficiaries of the information disclosed. BIS Review 25/1997

It is a great honour and pleasure for me to be invited to give the eighth Gerhard de Kock Memorial Lecture  especially as this is probably (if I am not mistaken) the first time that a governor from the reforming countries of Central and Eastern Europe has been afforded this privilege. The region of Central and Eastern Europe has undergone a profound re-shaping. More than 100 million people of Central and Eastern Europe got involved in a far-reaching process of political  economic and social change. Because of its unprecedented character and size the impact of this multidimensional transformation has been in continent-wide Europe. Indeed  the political and economic map of the whole of Europe is nowadays rather different from what it used to be throughout the postwar period till the 1990s. Ladies and gentlemen  allow me to share with you some experience we have acquired. At the beginning of my lecture I cannot avoid briefly mentioning options for economic and political reforms as opened up for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in the 1990s as well as the starting position of the former Czechoslovakia on the eve of the “velvet revolution” which in November 1989 enabled us to start a process of radical economic reforms. Initial conditions for economic reforms The task which confronted the countries after the fall of the communist regime was enormous. It involved radical change of the whole political  institutional  and economic system. Along with the rejection of the communist one-party rule  the principles of the past economic system  i.e. state ownership of the means of production and the central planning and management of the entire field of economic activity  being entirely discredited  were rejected too. The issue was thus substitution of the previous system and not its reform. The goal was a transition toward a democratic society - and toward a functioning market economy  based on the dominance of private ownership. The respective move from the Communist centrally planned economy back towards a capitalist market economy implies a qualitative change in the entire economic and social regime. As such it is a unique process in modern economic development. The challenge is not only to stabilise  deregulate and liberalise the economy  as was the case in countries with extensive interventions such as Spain or Chile several years ago. The transition in Central and Eastern Europe required basic institutional  systemic as well as socio-political changes at the same time; it is inevitably a multidimensional process. It follows that  while stabilisation programmes and reforms in the other parts of the world economy may provide useful lessons from their experience  there are substantial differences implied both in the initial conditions and in the substance of the process. The implications of that fact should be remembered when assessing the course of changes in the previously centrally planned economies. The transition in Central and Eastern Europe is inevitably a much more complex and longer-term phenomenon  for which no generalised theory could be available to apply. Such radical transformation requires a feasible strategy implemented with wide political support of the population. Transformation requires some minimum speed  and must start with some “critical mass” of change to secure sufficient impact on the behaviour of economic agents. In individual Central European post-communist countries  the sequence  speed  BIS Review 25/1997 - 2 - and forms of individual steps necessarily differed; they had different starting conditions  different degrees of political support of the new governments  and they also applied different strategies. The Czechoslovak case At the start of transformation in 1990  Czechoslovakia had some economic advantages over the other Central and East European post-communist countries. In Czechoslovakia  during the preceding decade  state budgets were mostly balanced  foreign debt was low  and the balance of payments showed no big deficits or surpluses. Inflation was relatively low. Even if there was an inflationary potential (reflected not only in open inflation but also in the forms of hidden and repressed inflation) and the monetary overhang was increasing in the 1980s  its dimensions continued to be considerably lower than in the other countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Czechoslovakia  especially the Czech Republic  also had the advantage of a long industrial history  and of well-educated and skilled labour. On the other hand  there were some disadvantages  especially if compared with Poland or Hungary. The system of a command economy was very pervasive in Czechoslovakia. There was practically no private sector; prices were centrally controlled; enterprise managers were operating within the limits of a rigid system of central planning  having little autonomy in decision-making. Market institutions were mostly lacking  particularly in the case of money  capital and labour markets. Czechoslovakia distinguished itself also as a country with an unfavourably biased size pattern of enterprises: big units  mostly administratively created  prevailed  while small enterprises were almost lacking. External economic ties were biased as well  being monopolised by the state: exports were predominantly aimed at Soviet and other communist countries’ markets. Especially high was the share of foreign trade with the Soviet Union (more than 40%). Connected with this was the fact that Czechoslovakia maintained a rather large proportion of heavy industries  an extensive but mostly obsolete stock of productive capital  along with underdeveloped services  neglected inadequate environmental protection. infrastructure and In coping with the challenge of a system substitution the contraints and even the counterproductiveness of the partial reform approach seemed to be recognised and accounted for in the Czechoslovak case. This was perhaps a lesson learned from the failures of reform attempts in the past. There appeared to be a widely shared consensus that a system replacement could hardly be achieved without a sufficient initial “shock”. Accordingly  the strategy followed aimed at a simultaneous implementation of the package of interrelated measures in order to secure sufficient impact on the behaviour of economic agents. Given the above general consensus  there were  however  widely differentiated stances as regards the contents of the respective “minimum packages”  their sequencing and the speed of their implementation. In previous discussions two alternative options - “fast” and “slow” movers - used to be identified as a shock therapy approach against a step-by-step  gradualistic or evolutionary type of approach. BIS Review 25/1997 - 3 - The Czechoslovak scenario opted for a transition path which was implemented as quickly as feasible  implying some parallel features with the shock therapy approach  in particular with reference to one stroke  simultaneous liberalisation of domestic prices  foreign trade and foreign exchange  and the introduction of limited currency convertibility (on current account for registered domestic businesses) at the very beginning of the transition process. The shock therapy approach was developed for the stabilisation programmes and followed in some countries of Latin America as well as in Poland and former Yugoslavia  where the dominant target of the economic policy was to cope with hyperinflation  to stabilise the economy as much and as fast as possible. The initial conditions in the CSFR differed  however  from those of the countries mentioned. Strategy of systemic and structural reforms The programme of political and economic transformation was formed during 1990  started in January 1991  and continued in the Czech Republic after the split of Czechoslovakia. From the start  the program included five main parts: - Macroeconomic stabilisation policies: a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy to remove the monetary overhang and to reintroduce macroeconomic equilibrium. - Liberalisation of prices: after 40 years of central price fixing  the bulk of prices were freed. - Liberalisation of external trade - and introduction of partial convertibility (for resident firms’ current account transactions). That required initial devaluation toward an exchange rate seen as viable from the point of view of the balance of payments. - Massive and rapid privatisation  including the use of the voucher scheme. - Social safety net to protect people whose standard of living dropped below poverty line. These adverse impacts of economic transformation were to be contained within tolerable limits. The programme aimed at re-establishing the role of prices and markets for an efficient allocation of resources. For the start  rationalisation of price relations implied a rise of the price level  owing to a monetary overhang  and to low downward price elasticity. In a small open economy  it made no sense to free internal prices without opening the economy to external competition and to world price relations. And  there could be no meaningful liberalisation of imports and exports without current account convertibility  introduced at least for resident firms. The short Polish and Hungarian experience showed  however  that free trade and partial convertibility should not be attempted without a preceding macroeconomic stabilisation. The first year of transformation - 1990 - was practically devoted to the stabilisation goal; further transformation steps taken in 1991 were accompanied by continuing stabilising policy. Measures seeking external stability were an indispensable part of the programme. It was understood that the exchange rate would have to be undervalued in relation to purchasing power parity to sustain the liberalised trade and a partly convertible currency and to function as a stabilisation anchor. Compared to steps such as freeing of prices  freeing of external trade  and introduction of partial convertibility  it was clear that privatisation would be a gradual  more time-consuming process. First  steps were taken to stop state subsidies to firms (as well as to prices)  and to let the firms face a hard budget constraint; that included also a stricter credit policy by commercial banks. A shift of property rights to private hands was the only way how to BIS Review 25/1997 - 4 - change fundamentally the behaviour of firms  expose them to the pressures of the market  and initiate productivity increase and structural change. In 1989 the private sector was almost non-existent in the former Czechoslovakia  accounting just for 3 per cent of GDP. Domestic capital base was weak and institutions of market economy such as stack exchange and developed financial sector were lacking. Therefore  a combination of standard privatisation methods (that means sales  including sales to foreign investors) with non-standard ones was used to speed up the process. So called small privatisation (small factories  real estate  retail stores  restaurants  hotels  repair shops etc.) was proceeding swiftly since early 1991 and was more or less accomplished by the end of 1992. It went by auctions  but also restitution of property to its former owners played a very important part and contributed to the success of the programme. In large privatisation (large state-owned enterprises)  one part of the property was sold  another part was distributed free of charge to the entire population  through so-called investment vouchers. Standard methods such as direct sale  auctions  public tenders  and transfers of property to municipalities were used along with the voucher scheme. Foreign investors were  and are  welcome; in fact  the program of rapid and mass privatisation in the Czech Republic offered foreign investors an opportunity which will not be repeated in future. Privatisation of an almost fully state-owned economy is a task which requires years rather than months. Now the bulk of privatisation has been accomplished  and it is starting to influence positively the performance of the economy. Within the last six years the share of private sector jumped from 3 to 75 per cent. But the problem of behaviour of the new owners  and of effective corporate governance  is still rather acute in the Czech Republic. Special problems are posed by the large ownership of equity by investment funds which emerged during the voucher privatisation  as well as by large banks which themselves are still partly in state hands. Thus  one cannot say that privatisation has been as yet accomplished fully. What remains  however  is a more standard situation  posing similar problems as privatisation of state-owned companies in the advanced market economies. As to the future prevailing model of corporate governance  the Czech Republic can be expected to converge toward the practice which will be most widely observed within the European Union countries. Macroeconomic stabilisation The transformation strategy required a constant effort to achieve macroeconomic stabilisation. Tight fiscal policy  based on a balanced or surplus state budget  and prudent monetary policy  were mutually supporting each other. These were supplemented by wage controls and overall income policy within the so-called heterodox concept of macroeconomic stabilisation. During transformation  Czech monetary policy used two basic tools to fight inflation: targeting monetary aggregates  and the nominal anchor of a fixed exchange rate. The Czech experience with curbing inflation during a transformation period is successful  compared to other transforming economies of Central Europe. When  in January 1991  the bulk of prices in the Czech economy were freed after 40 years of central price fixing  the result was a yearly increase of the price level by almost 58%. However  no inflationary spiral evolved  and  since 1992  inflation showed a falling long-term trend towards a single digit rate in 1995-1996. BIS Review 25/1997 - 5 - The initial jump of prices in 1991 was not accompanied by a similarly steep increase of nominal wages. Instead  real wages fell. That created some room for subsequent increases in real wages without serious inflationary consequences. In 1995 and 1996  however  the growth of real wages  which - if aggregated over all sectors - was faster than the increase in productivity  became one of the potential inflationary dangers. The nominal anchor of the fixed exchange rate played an important role in the relatively good Czech results in fighting inflation. Instead of repeated smaller devaluations as in Poland or Hungary  the Czech Republic used a combination of a large initial devaluation and a subsequently fixed nominal exchange rate. In 1990 - before the start of the full transformation programme - the currency was devalued by more than 50%. That subsequently enabled us to keep the nominal exchange rate stable for five years. After the introduction of a wider 7.5% fluctuation band in 1996  the exchange rate is within the band. Transformation involved so much fundamental change that its start inevitably led to an initial fall of output and GDP. However  part of the former higher output level was simply feeding the enormous waste which went on throughout the command economy. In 1993  GDP stagnated partly due to the split-up of Czechoslovakia. Economic growth was resumed in the Czech Republic in 1994 and continued in 1995 and 1996 as a fast growth period. Unemployment has been kept low during the whole transformation period  thanks mainly to the rapid emergence of new private firms  and a large shift of labour into the previously underdeveloped service sector. Even with microeconomic restructuring going on  unemployment is not expected to exceed a 4 % level in the near future. Monetary policy tools In a command type economy  monetary policy reflected state plans expressed mainly in physical terms. Planned direct credit allocation was linked to the planned growth of national income. Credits to enterprises were directly allocated  with little attention paid to the creditworthiness of the borrowing enterprise. Risk was socialised due to the existence of a unitary banking system. The introduction of a new Central Bank Act and a new banking law in late 1989 marked the beginning of the development of a market-oriented banking system. The Act laid the basis for establishing a two-tier banking system through the separation of the central bank and commercial banking functions and provided the central bank with the means for conducting monetary policy and with regulatory authority over banks. The latter established the legal basis for a universal banking system. The separation of central banking from commercial banking was put into effect on January 1  1990. The dissolution of the Czechoslovak Federation into two independent republics on January 1  1993  meant the creation of the Czech National Bank (CNB). According to the Act  the CNB is independent of any instructions given by the government. The CNB is obliged to submit to the Parliament a report on monetary development at least two times a year and to inform the general public on monetary development at least once every three months. Further  under this Act the CNB has at its disposal practically all the tools known to advanced market economies. BIS Review 25/1997 - 6 - At the beginning of the transformation process  the main tools of monetary policy were  quite naturally  direct ones. Credit limits  interest rate ceilings expressed as maximum deviations from the discount rate and refinancing loans (in 1991 represented for small  new banks on the average 60 per cent of total sources but for big banks 5-10 per cent only) were used. Credit and interest rate ceilings were abolished in 1992 which can be regarded as a transition year towards indirect control of monetary developments. After credit ceilings on the minor banks were removed in April 1992 and on the major banks in October  central bank control of monetary developments was effected through discount rates  minimum reserve requirements  auction refinancing credits and central bank bills. My predecessors behind this chair  the governors of the central banks from Germany and Switzerland  underlined the role of money supply targets in the kit of tools. In this respect the Czechoslovak and the Czech practice can enrich the experience. Since 1990 the intermediate targets have been set in the form of planned changes in credits or money. For 1990 the target was “to keep the development of credits in total within the scope of -2 per cent to +1 per cent related to the level at the end of 1989”. In the following years the starting point for the monetary programme was the expected development of both real GDP and the inflation rate with the corrections for the envisaged changes in income velocity of money (in the Czech terminology the relevant aggregate M2 consists of currency and demand deposits  time and savings deposits and deposits in foreign currency). To be up-to-date  in 1997 we are targeting the increase of money supply by 8-12 per cent. The philosophy behind money supply targeting is well known. Without a deep reflection upon this theme I recall the message of famous equation of exchange: Total monetary expenditures have to increase proportionally  if the velocity is constant  to nominally expressed GDP. Nothing more and nothing less is required from monetary policy. Monetary policy should serve one goal only: to repress high inflation and provide for a stable currency. As a rule of thumb this reasoning is both understandable and acceptable but a more profound discussion must draw our attention to several points: Neglecting at this moment the different versions of the equation of exchange what can we understand under the heading “total physical volume of transactions” on the right side of this equation? For the economies in transition the difference between the total volume of transactions and transactions counted in national income accounting is important. A part of the transactions is used for intermediate-good or inter-business expenditures and is not counted in the GDP accounts. Some transactions are not registered at all  for example  those in the underground economy  some imports and so forth. The decomposition of nominal GDP into a change in real output and a change in the price level is not a trivial exercise even in advanced market economies. But in these countries  e.g. in Germany or USA  the prediction of real GDP rests on more solid grounds - one knows approximately what is the “potential output” as the starting point for some guessing as concerns the development in the medium term. In transition economies  in the period of deep structural changes  the estimate of both real GDP and potential output is much more difficult. BIS Review 25/1997 - 7 - The traditional unidirectional link from money to income is blurred in advanced market economies by the existence of many forms of financial assets with different degrees of liquidity. In transforming economies  the scope for reserve assets (Treasury bills) and investment assets (bonds  shares) is still limited but is widening step by step  thus weakening also the links between the money stock and expenditure flows. What is probably even more important  at least in the Czech Republic  is the financing of receivables and current liabilities through quasi-commercial credits (inter-enterprise indebtedness). There is a scope  created by enterprises themselves  for offsetting the potential effects of monetary stringency on spending plans. A version of the equation of exchange suitable for transforming economies should therefore take into account on the left side not only money in the narrow and broader sense but also estimates of different kinds of quasi-credit. Textbook knowledge says that the constancy  or at least the predictability of velocity either in income or in transaction terms  turns the equation of exchange into the quantity theory of money. At this point  last year’s speaker  Dr Tietmeyer  had again a more favourable position  because he could rely on the predictable and the longer-term change in the income velocity of the German mark. In the Czech Republic the velocity is neither constant nor reliably predictable yet. In the first stage of economic transformation the income velocity declined in line with the increasing transaction demand for money. Only later on did velocity start to stabilise and recently we have observed some increase in velocity. Last but not least  one must point out that  even in the quantity theory applied in advanced market economies  there is a certain “black box” connecting the quantity of money on the one hand and its effect on prices and quantities on the other. Between a change in monetary aggregates and offsetting changes in other variables  there is a transmission mechanism  with its specific features determined by the institutional framework in which it operates. On the top of it some prices  like housing rents and energy price  are still under the control of the government and the process of deregulation cannot be perfectly anticipated due to the political implications. To specify the transmission mechanism and to open the “black box” means both to describe and analyse the ways in which money is created and how it influences real variables. These ways change through the evolution of new institutions in transforming economies. Besides money supply targeting  operative targets have been used. As the operative target the monetary base (currency plus minimum reserves plus free reserves) was replaced in the second half of 1994 by bank reserves and a system was implemented for the daily prediction of liquidity management on the money market. Since then the monetary base has been used as an indicator. In order to reduce the fluctuation of free reserves in the banking system and the volatility of interbank deposit market interest rates  the CNB shortened their maintenance cycle to 14 days commencing March 1st  1994. Since then refinancing credits have been provided only when fully covered by securities (repo operations). This CNB shift to daily operational monetary policy management based on repo operations and the gradual strengthening of the role of these operations in the sterilisation of foreign capital inflows  particularly in the second half of 1995  led to the repo market’s gradual development. BIS Review 25/1997 - 8 - As from the beginning of 1996 a one-week PRIBOR interest rate replaced bank reserves management as the operative target. The quantitative target has been replaced by an interest rate target with the aim to efficiently affect  on a daily basis  the interest rate level at the short end of the yield curve. This major change was facilitated by the gradual development of the money market and its cultivation by the CNB. The one-week PRIBOR rate is affected through sales of securities with a date specified in advance of their repurchase (repos) with one and two week maturities  for which a limited repo rate is announced. New challenge: monetary aggregates in a small open economy The monetary survey of the CNB indicates the structure of the money supply (M2) on the liabilities side (corresponding to the demand side) and its sources on the assets side (corresponding to the supply side). By comparing the assets and liabilities  one can reveal the different sources of the money supply. The main sources of money supply growth are particularly dependent on the specific conditions of each economy  reflecting mainly the proportion of the influence of domestic and foreign sources of growth. In general  the main sources of money supply growth include money issued in the form of credits granted by banks to both households and enterprises in domestic currency  the conversion of foreign exchange inflows into domestic currency (net foreign assets)  net credit to the government and the net position of the National Property Fund and the residual called “other items net” (mainly own capital and bank reserves). Developments in the period 1993-1996 reveal some interesting features: Credits to enterprises and households in domestic currency  which are quite naturally the main source of money supply  exhibited a relatively slower growth up to the end of 1995  followed by a relatively quicker growth in 1996 when these credits became the main impetus of money supply growth. The most remarkable feature was the growing share of net foreign assets up to December 1995 which resulted especially in 1993-1995 in the deviations of the dynamics of M2 out of the corridor laid down by monetary policy and which gave rise to the sterilisation efforts of the CNB. The influence of net credit to the government plus the net position of the National Property Fund was negligible in the period under analysis  and in some periods it even dampened money supply growth. This fact is probably unique in the transforming countries of Central and Eastern Europe and reflects the prudent fiscal stance of Czech macroeconomic policy. A more detailed answer to the causes of changes in the degree of impact of individual factors on money supply growth can be found when studying their development in different periods of the transformation. In Czechoslovakia  during the first transformation years (1990-1992) money supply growth was based primarily on the relatively quickly increasing volume of credits granted to enterprises due to growing credit demand  which was very closely connected with the BIS Review 25/1997 - 9 - liberalisation of entrepreneurial activities in a newly created market environment (an increasing number of businesses in need of initial capital). Gradually  foreign money creation also expanded  affected by the development of an improving balance of payments  particularly the current account. The gradual stabilisation of the macroeconomic and political environment (apparent mainly after the dissolution of the Czechoslovak Federation in January  1993  and the relatively rapid calming of price developments following the introduction of a new tax system based on value added tax)  the commencement of the activities of capital market institutions and the stability of the exchange rate which significantly decreased the risks for foreign investors  led in the second half of 1993 to a significant strengthening of the influence of the inflow of foreign funds into the Czech Republic on money supply growth. The strong foreign capital inflows continued to influence money supply growth in 1994 and 1995 when capital inflows reached 18 per cent of GDP. This growth was particularly generated by increasing foreign direct investments  portfolio investments and relatively cheaper foreign credits drawn by domestic enterprises. Because the increasing inflow of foreign money was accompanied by a continuous demand for credits on the part of enterprises (financed partially also from foreign resources)  this situation called for the sterilisation of excess funds  taking into account the goals of monetary policy. Paradoxically  due to the government’s sound fiscal policy  we were confronted with an insufficient amount of government securities  and therefore the CNB had to issue its own bills and sold them to commercial banks to weaken the impact on the volume of money stock. A certain turnaround has occurred since the end of 1995. Contrary to previous years  the foreign sector helped to weaken money supply growth due to an increasing balance of trade deficit and the slower growth of foreign capital inflows into the country. Exchange rate policy The above-mentioned development of the composition of the monetary aggregates has influenced attitudes vis-à-vis exchange rate policy. At the beginning of the transformation we were faced with the difficult choice of setting an appropriate exchange rate. On the eve of the programme of price and trade liberalisation the government took the decision to use the exchange rate as a nominal anchor because in a small  open economy the domestic price level is heavily affected by the exchange rate. Having taken into account various considerations in December 1990  we fixed the new exchange rate at 28 Czechoslovak crowns per US dollar  which then was about the middle ground between the parallel black market rate and the calculated cost of earning one dollar of foreign exchange. BIS Review 25/1997 - 10 - Since then the Czech crown has been pegged firstly to a basket of the currencies of five major trading partners and since 1993  with a view to the development of the currency breakdown of foreign payments  to a two-currency basket (65 per cent Deutsche Mark and 35 per cent US dollar). The improvement in macroeconomic stability and relatively high foreign exchange reserves created good starting conditions for the gradual extension of the Czech crown’s convertibility. Some additional measures were taken in 1994 by means of an amendment in August 1994 to the Foreign Exchange Act. This amendment made it possible to export securities denominated in Czech currency; foreign exchange permits for direct investment outside the Czech Republic were provided to virtually all applicants and permit procedures for obtaining foreign exchange credits from abroad and for equity participation abroad were simplified. Effective October 1  1995 the Czech currency became convertible in accordance with Article VIII of the IMF Articles of Agreement  and the country became a member of the OECD. Under the new Foreign Exchange Act the current account of the balance of payments was liberalised and the regulation of the capital account was substantially reduced. Only the establishment of accounts abroad by residents  the outright purchase of securities by residents  the provision of financial credits to non-residents and real estate purchases by non-residents continue to be subject to regulation. Textbook analysis (the Mundell-Fleming model for an open economy) demonstrates that a nation under a fixed nominal exchange rate system cannot pursue an independent monetary policy. Developments in the Czech Republic in 1993-1995 confirms this statement. The rapid increase in net foreign assets mentioned above had to be dampened by a smaller increase of domestic credits and in February 1996 gave rise to an important decision of the CNB’s Board. The Bank’s Board widened the band for the fluctuations of the crown’s exchange rate from 0.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent  including the maintenance of a 0.25 per cent spread  i.e. the difference between the buying and selling rate used in transactions between the CNB and commercial banks at the foreign exchange fixing. The CNB is prepared to intervene only in such a way that the exchange rate does not deviate from the announced fluctuation band. In January 1997 we witnessed an interesting and rather suprising development. In spite of the factors working in the medium run in the direction of depreciation (the higher inflation rate in the Czech Republic than in the countries of our major trading partners and the increasing trade deficit) the exchange rate as hovering around 4 per cent in the revaluation band! The explanation is given by the theory of asset demand - there is still a high demand for Czech crowns by foreign entities. Inflation and monetary policy Instead of using money supply target as an intermediary target  some countries (New Zealand  the United Kingdom and others) aim directly at inflation goals because no sufficiently reliable relation exists between any conceivable intermediate target and inflation. BIS Review 25/1997 - 11 - This practice has not been adopted in the Czech Republic because in transforming economies the link between the money supply and the price level has some specific features. Everybody agrees with Friedman that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. It means that over the longer term  a general rise in prices is not possible without an undue expansion of the money stock. One of my predecessors in this series of lectures  the former President of the Swiss National Bank  Dr. Markus Lusser  declared in his memorial lecture in 1994 that in Switzerland the time lapse between the introduction of monetary policy measures and their impact on prices is two to three years.

Brash  to the IMF conference on banking soundness and monetary policy in a world of global capital markets held in Washington on 30/1/97. My address this morning is on “Banking Soundness and the Role of the Market”. As most of you will already know  this is a subject of particular relevance to New Zealand  given that we have adopted a banking supervision approach which places considerable emphasis on the role of the market in promoting a sound financial system. In my speech today I will be outlining the key features of our new approach to banking supervision and the reasons why we have gone in this direction. Although much of my address will focus on the New Zealand experience  I will attempt to draw some general conclusions about the role market disciplines can play in promoting a sound and efficient financial system - conclusions that may have relevance for the design of banking supervision arrangements in other countries. Before I outline the new approach to banking supervision in New Zealand  I think it would be useful to give you a little background on the supervisory structure which operated at the time that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand conducted its review of banking supervision. Background to New Zealand’s Banking Supervision Arrangements New Zealand first adopted a formalised approach to banking supervision in 1987. For most of the period from then until the end of 1995 New Zealand’s approach to banking supervision was relatively orthodox. It involved: minimum capital requirements (based on the Basle Capital Accord); limits on the amount which banks could lend to individual customers and related parties; a limit on banks’ open foreign exchange positions; off-site monitoring of banks  using information provided privately to the Reserve Bank; annual consultations with the senior management of banks; and a range of powers to enable the Reserve Bank to respond to bank distress or failure. However  the former system of banking supervision differed in some important respects from the approaches adopted in many other countries. In particular  New Zealand’s supervisory framework: did not involve the licensing or supervision of deposit-taking or the business of banking - only those entities wishing to use the word “bank” in their name were subject to supervision; did not feature deposit insurance; did not seek to protect depositors per se - instead  it sought to protect the financial system as a whole; and BIS Review /1997 - 2 - did not involve any form of on-site examination of banks. These distinguishing features continue to apply under the new supervisory framework. In late 1991 we commenced a major review of our banking supervision arrangements. The review was motivated by a number of concerns. Probably the main reason for commencing the review was a concern that conventional approaches to banking supervision generally make insufficient use of market disciplines as a means of promoting a sound and efficient financial system. We believed that there was considerable scope to use market disciplines to promote systemic stability. In particular  we wished to provide the market with a greater capacity to hold the directors and management to account for the sound management of their bank. And we wanted to improve the market’s ability to make well informed decisions as to which banks they would do business with. As I note later in this address  we concluded that the introduction of a well focused and comprehensive disclosure regime would go a long way towards achieving these objectives. Another factor which led us to review our banking supervision arrangements was a concern at the compliance costs and regulatory distortions which can be associated with conventional approaches to banking supervision. This concern reflects our view that banking supervisors tend to have strong incentives to promote a stable financial system  without always having appropriate regard to the compliance costs and regulatory distortions to which supervision and prudential regulation can give rise. We were also concerned at the taxpayer risk involved in the traditional approach to banking supervision. Although this risk is present regardless of the form banking supervision takes  it is likely to be greater where the banking supervisor  and only the banking supervisor  has regular access to financial information on a bank. It is also likely to be greater the more intensive the supervision process is. We wanted to explore ways of reducing the risk of the government being called upon to rescue a bank in distress. Finally  we recognised that conventional banking supervision can only go so far in promoting a sound banking system. There are inherent limitations in the extent to which prudential regulation and supervision  even supervision which includes on-site examinations  can minimise the incidence of bank distress and failure. This is evidenced by the fact that countries with intensive supervisory regimes have not been immune from serious episodes of financial distress. Indeed  we were concerned that banking supervision could even be increasing the risk of bank failure or distress  by potentially reducing the incentives for bank directors and managers to make their own considered judgements about what constitutes prudent behaviour. The New Approach to Banking Supervision in New Zealand In the light of these concerns  and following a lengthy period of review  we concluded that the concerns we had identified could be substantially addressed by placing greater reliance on market disciplines through public disclosure by banks  increasing the accountability of bank directors and management  and reducing the extent of prudential regulation. The new banking supervision arrangements  which came into force on 1 January 1996  reflect these conclusions. BIS Review /1997 - 3 - The new approach differs from the former regime in two main areas. First  a new disclosure regime applicable to all banks operating in New Zealand has been introduced. The disclosure regime is designed to substantially strengthen the market disciplines on banks and sharpen the incentives for the directors and management of banks to manage their banks’ affairs in a sound and responsible manner. I will outline the main features of the disclosure arrangements shortly. The second major change involved a reduction in the extent of prudential regulation of banks. The main changes included: the removal of the former limit on the amount which banks may lend to their customers; the removal of the limit on banks’ open foreign exchange exposures; the removal of the Reserve Bank’s guidelines on internal controls and the associated audit requirements; and the removal of the need for banks to privately report their financial position and risk exposures to the Reserve Bank. We were satisfied that the introduction of the new disclosure regime obviated the need for many of the former prudential controls on banks. Undoubtedly the feature of the new approach that has attracted most attention is the disclosure regime. Let me briefly outline its main features. Under the new arrangements  all banks operating in New Zealand must publish a disclosure statement each quarter. The disclosure statements are in two forms: a brief Key Information Summary  which is aimed at the ordinary depositor; and a more comprehensive General Disclosure Statement  which is aimed principally at the professional analyst. The Key Information Summary contains a short summary of key information on a bank  including: the bank’s credit rating (or a statement that the bank has no credit rating); the bank’s capital ratios  measured using the Basle framework; and information on peak exposure concentration  peak exposures to related parties  asset quality  shareholder guarantees (if any) and profitability. The Key Information Summary must be displayed prominently in  and be available on demand from  every bank branch. The General Disclosure Statement contains wider-ranging and much more detailed information on a bank and its banking group  including: corporate information and some information on parent banks (where applicable); comprehensive financial statements (including a five year summary of key financial data); credit rating information (including any changes to the rating in the two years preceding a bank’s most recent disclosure statement balance date); detailed information on capital adequacy  asset quality and various risk exposures BIS Review /1997 - 4 - (including exposure concentration and related party exposures); information on funds management and securitisation activities  risk management systems  and a summary of the prudential regulations imposed on the bank in question by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand; information on the bank’s exposure to market risk  both peak and end of period (and in respect of the full banking book). The disclosure statements issued by banks are subject to full external audit at the end of year and a limited scope audit review at the half year. Disclosure statements issued at the other quarters in the year are not required to be audited. One of the most important features of the disclosure framework is the role it accords bank directors. Each director is required to sign their bank’s disclosure statements (or authorise someone to sign on his or her behalf) and to make certain attestations in the disclosure statements  including: whether the bank is complying with the prudential requirements imposed on it by the Reserve Bank; whether the bank has systems in place to adequately monitor and control its banking risks and whether those systems are being properly applied; whether the bank’s exposure to related parties is contrary to the interests of the bank; and whether the disclosure statement contains all the required disclosures and is not false or misleading. Directors face severe criminal and civil penalties (including up to three years’ jail and personal liability for creditors’ losses) if a disclosure statement is held to be false or misleading. The disclosure arrangements are expected to bring a number of important benefits to the New Zealand financial system: We are confident that the disclosure arrangements are playing an important role in strengthening market disciplines on banks. Under the new arrangements the market has considerably greater information on a bank’s financial performance and risk positions than was previously the case. And the information is available more frequently and in a more timely manner. The market therefore has greater scope to react to developments affecting a bank’s financial condition - rewarding those banks which are well managed and penalising those which appear to be less well managed. The strongest banks are likely to benefit from that strength by operating at lower costs; weaker banks are likely to be under pressure to strengthen their position. Over the longer term we believe that stronger market disciplines will make a major contribution to the soundness of New Zealand’s financial system. Another benefit which we expect to see from the disclosure regime is a growing emphasis on the important role which bank directors play in overseeing the prudent management of their banks. The disclosure framework reinforces and provides a sharper focus on the duties of bank directors. In particular  it sharpens the focus on directors’ duties to ensure that their bank has the necessary systems in place to identify  monitor and manage adequately the bank’s various business risks  and to ensure that those systems are being properly applied at all times. The disclosure requirements are also likely to increase the accountability of bank directors and  indirectly  the accountability of various levels of management within the banks. As a result of the disclosure arrangements  we would expect to see directors taking greater care than might otherwise have been the case to ensure that they are adequately discharging their BIS Review /1997 - 5 - obligations. In so doing  it is likely that directors will take steps to ensure that there are appropriate accountability mechanisms within the management hierarchy. Over time  we expect that the increased accountability of bank directors will lead to an improvement in the quality of bank boards. Shareholders now face stronger incentives to ensure that the directors of their banks have the appropriate skills  experience  integrity and judgement to fulfil the duties expected of them. Another important benefit which we hope will flow from the disclosure regime is a reduction in the risk that the taxpayer will be called upon to rescue a bank. As a result of the disclosure arrangements we hope that there will be a stronger public perception that the management and directors of a bank have the sole responsibility for the management of their bank’s affairs. Moreover  the public now has access to much the same information on banks as does the Reserve Bank  thereby eliminating the monopoly of information which supervisors generally tend to have in respect of a bank’s financial condition. Both of these factors should assist in enabling future governments to resist the inevitable pressures to rescue a bank in distress or to insulate creditors from losses - at least to some extent. Although the new supervisory framework places great emphasis on the role that market disciplines can play in promoting systemic stability  it is important to note that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has not abandoned its responsibilities for the financial system. We recognise that  for the time being at least  systemic stability is best served by a combination of market disciplines and banking supervision. In particular  we see value in: retaining some control over which entities may call themselves banks in New Zealand; the Reserve Bank maintaining a sound understanding of the state of the financial system; and the Reserve Bank retaining a capacity to respond to financial distress or bank failure  where this threatens financial system stability. In this context  a number of the Reserve Bank’s core functions have been retained. The Reserve Bank continues to have responsibility for registering new banks. Banks continue to be subject to minimum capital requirements (in line with the Basle Capital Accord) and a limit on lending to related parties. Although we believe that disclosure alone would ensure that banks would maintain capital at least equivalent to the 8% minimum  we consider that retention of the minimum capital requirements reinforces the credibility of the new supervisory framework  at no additional cost to banks. The Reserve Bank continues to monitor banks on a quarterly basis. However  monitoring is now conducted principally using banks’ public disclosure statements  in contrast to the former system of monitoring on the basis of information provided privately to the Reserve Bank. In most respects  banks’ disclosure statements contain information which is more comprehensive and more reliable than the information previously provided privately to the Reserve Bank. BIS Review /1997 - 6 - The Reserve Bank also continues to consult with the senior management of banks. Formal prudential consultations are held annually  and generally focus on the strategic direction of the banks  major changes in their operations and other high level issues. In addition  as Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand  I meet with the chief executives of the larger banks on a regular basis to discuss a broad range of issues  including issues relating to the banking industry and to the wider economy. And  importantly  the Reserve Bank retains a wide-ranging capacity to respond to financial distress or bank failure where a bank’s financial condition poses a serious threat to the stability of the banking system. As with the former supervision arrangements  the objective underlying the above responsibilities is the promotion of a sound and efficient financial system. Depositor protection does not feature in the Reserve Bank’s objectives. Reactions to the New Approach to Banking Supervision All in all  I believe that the new approach has been relatively well accepted. But it has taken time for that acceptance to be achieved. It is fair to say that  during the review process  reservations about the new approach were expressed from a number of quarters  both at home and abroad. I think it would be useful to mention some of these. One of the observations made has been that New Zealand is “free riding” on the efforts of the home supervisors. We firmly reject this notion. We believe that the new supervisory framework is at least as effective at promoting prudent banking practices as are the more traditional approaches to banking supervision. And we are satisfied that the new framework enables the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to fulfil its duties as a host supervisor within the terms of the Basle Concordat. In that regard  under the new approach to banking supervision  the Reserve Bank of New Zealand remains well informed about the activities and financial condition of all banks operating in New Zealand  and well placed to respond to incipient financial distress where appropriate. Indeed  as I have already noted  the disclosure regime provides the Reserve Bank (and the public) with information which is generally more comprehensive than the information previously received by the Reserve Bank. But it is certainly true that any host supervisor will - inevitably - rely to some extent on the global supervision of the home supervisor. After all  this is an intrinsic part of the Basle Concordat. The most a host supervisor can realistically achieve is to promote prudent banking practices in the local operations of the banks within its jurisdiction. In the context of the above point  some commentators have suggested that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is not well placed to anticipate emerging financial distress in the absence of conducting on-site examinations of banks or otherwise obtaining private information from banks. Although I acknowledge that on-site examinations do increase the information available to banking supervisors  I am not at all convinced that the information obtained from such examinations enables the supervisors to reliably anticipate incipient financial distress. In modern banking  risk positions can and do change rapidly. A week in politics might be a long time  but in banking it is a very long time indeed! This is becoming increasingly the case. The information obtained from on-site examinations  or from any other sources for that matter  can only provide a snapshot of a bank’s risk positions at a particular point in time  and even then generally only in respect of a subset of the bank’s business. For these reasons I believe any such BIS Review /1997 - 7 - information is of limited usefulness in assessing the dynamics of a bank’s risk positions or in anticipating financial distress. I acknowledge  of course  that publicly disclosed information also has these limitations. But at least public disclosure brings with it the incentives for the sound management of banking risks. I am not at all sure that the private disclosure of information to a banking supervisor - whether on-site or off-site - creates these types of incentives. A further concern we have with on-site examinations or the off-site collection of detailed private information on banks  at least in the New Zealand context  is the risk that these approaches can blur the lines of responsibility for the management of banks. If the banking supervisor has responsibility for regular on-site examinations  it presumably follows that the supervisor also has responsibility for encouraging or requiring a bank to modify its risk positions or make other adjustments to its balance sheet where the supervisor has concerns in relation to the bank’s risk profile. This has the potential to erode the incentives for the directors and management of banks to take ultimate responsibility for the management of banking risks  effectively passing some of this responsibility to the banking supervisor. It also has the potential to create public perceptions that the responsibility for managing banking risks is effectively shared between a bank’s directors and the banking supervisors. In turn  this makes it very difficult indeed for a government to eschew responsibility for rescuing a bank in difficulty. I acknowledge that any system of banking supervision - even one that relies principally on public disclosure - will inevitably create public expectations that the supervisory authority takes some responsibility for the management of banking risks. And I acknowledge that any system of banking supervision creates a risk for the taxpayer in the event that a bank gets into difficulty. However  in order to minimise these risks  the Reserve Bank of New Zealand prefers to keep the spotlight clearly focused on the directors and management of a bank  rather than risk a further blurring of their accountability. We believe that the avoidance of having an on-site examination role or otherwise regularly obtaining private information from banks assists in this regard and reinforces market disciplines on banks. Another observation frequently made is that New Zealand would not have adopted the new framework had a substantial part of its banking system been domestically owned. It is my firmly-held conviction that we would have adopted this approach even if all or most of our banks had been locally-owned. I say this because we believe that the regime is actually more likely to promote prudent banking behaviour than do the more traditional approaches  but with a lower likelihood of moral hazard and regulatory distortion. In this context  I should note that  at the time we commenced our review of banking supervision  in late 1991  a significant part of the New Zealand banking system was still domestically owned. Indeed  as I see it  many of the changes we have implemented in New Zealand would be of equal relevance to those jurisdictions in which the core of the banking system is domestically owned. Another criticism made of the New Zealand approach is that comprehensive and frequent disclosure can  in some circumstances  exacerbate financial system distress  rather than promote systemic stability. I acknowledge that  in some circumstances  disclosure could exacerbate a bank’s difficulties. For example  where a bank is required to disclose a loss or a severe deterioration in asset quality  this could lead to a sharp adverse reaction by the market  possibly causing the bank in question to come under liquidity pressure. Of course  this possibility exists with even the barest disclosure requirements - such as with the release of an annual report or a six monthly interim disclosure. And the risks of adverse market reaction are present even in the absence of disclosure requirements - for example  as a result of market BIS Review /1997 - 8 - speculation as to a bank’s financial condition. Indeed  in some circumstances the disclosure of comprehensive information might actually reduce the risk of the market reacting adversely to misinformation or to an absence of information. In any case  where a bank knows in advance that it will be making adverse disclosures  it would generally have the opportunity to take steps to reduce the risk of an adverse market reaction. These steps would include the disclosure of the remedial measures being taken to address the bank’s difficulties. Of course  the risk of a severe market reaction to an adverse disclosure creates the very incentives for banks to ensure that they manage their affairs in such a way that there will be no adverse developments to disclose. In the longer term  therefore  the risk of adverse market reaction could be expected to promote a sounder financial system. One of the criticisms often made of public disclosure by banks is that the vast majority of depositors will not read banks’ disclosure statements. On this assumption  some observers suggest that disclosure is of very limited effectiveness. We do not agree. It is certainly true that most depositors are unlikely to read the disclosure statements. But the disclosure regime in New Zealand is not predicated on the assumption of wide readership by the ordinary depositor. The source of market disciplines does not lie in wide public readership. Rather  the efficacy of the disclosure regime rests on the assumption that the disclosure statements will be read by the agents of depositors  such as the financial news media  financial analysts and investment advisers  and by wholesale creditors and fellow bankers. It is the risk of adverse reactions by these types of disclosure users that creates the incentives for bank directors and management to manage their banks’ affairs in such a way as to avoid the need to make adverse disclosures. Although the disclosure regime does not rely on the mass readership of disclosure statements by depositors  the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is encouraging depositors to take a greater interest in their banks’ disclosures. Over much of last year we actively promoted publicity about the new disclosure arrangements. And we prepared a “user’s guide” to assist depositors (and their agents) to understand the disclosures being made by banks. The user’s guide is now available in every bank branch in the country. While it is unlikely to be a “best seller”  it is encouraging to note that there has  in fact  been a surprising degree of interest in it from the public. We hope that  over time  an increasing proportion of depositors will take a keener interest in their banks’ financial condition. Another observation made about the new framework is that our approach places an excessive emphasis on the role of bank directors - that we are asking too much of them. To illustrate this point  during the review process  I had a visit from the chief executive of one major international bank with an operation in New Zealand. He had come to protest strongly at the requirement that bank directors would have to sign the disclosure statements every quarter and attest to the appropriateness of their risk management systems. When I asked why  he said “... bank directors understand absolutely nothing about banking...”. This comment is quite unfair about many bank directors  of course  but there is an uncomfortable element of truth in it in some cases. The blame for this situation almost certainly lies  in part  on a supervision regime which had assumed too much of the responsibility for the viability of banks. We very much hope that a regime which will continue to have some key regulations  but which is based primarily on market disclosure and director attestations  will improve that situation. BIS Review /1997 Early Indications of the Effects of the Disclosure Regime - 9 - Although it is far too early to make conclusive assessments of the success or otherwise of the new supervisory approach  there have been some encouraging signs that the disclosure requirements are meeting a number of their objectives. I will briefly highlight a few of these. We have been encouraged by the fact that the financial news media in New Zealand have taken a close interest in the new bank disclosure regime. The quarterly disclosure statements have received quite detailed scrutiny from the news media  resulting in greater and more focused public exposure of banks’ financial results and risk positions. We hope that this type of media attention will sharpen the incentives for banks’ directors and management to manage their banks’ affairs prudently. A good example of the news media’s interest in banks’ disclosure statements was the media’s interest in one bank’s disclosure of its non-compliance with a Reserve Bank prudential requirement. We were surprised at the intensity of the media’s interest in this disclosure - as  I suspect  were the management and directors of the bank in question. Hopefully  this type of media attention  and the attendant adverse publicity to which it inevitably gives rise  will encourage banks to ensure that they comply with Reserve Bank requirements in the future. I am inclined to think that the threat of adverse publicity is likely to be a more effective discipline on banks than are many of the standard supervisory sanctions for breaches of regulatory requirements. Interestingly  the disclosure regime seems to be strengthening the extent to which banks scrutinise each other’s financial performance and risk positions. We are aware that banks are making considerable use of the disclosure statements to monitor each other. The additional and more frequent information now available could be expected to assist banks in managing their inter-bank exposure positions and in assessing the extent and nature of the business they conduct with each other. We believe that the banking industry itself is one of the most potent sources of market disciplines on individual banks. Anecdotal feedback suggests that the obligations now placed on bank directors are causing the directors of some banks to exercise greater scrutiny of their banks’ risk positions. In turn  this seems to be focusing greater attention on the systems they have in place for identifying and managing risks. Moreover  it seems that some banks are taking steps to increase the accountability of various levels of management within their banks. We are also aware that some banks have engaged external consultants to review aspects of their risk management systems. It seems that part of the motivation for conducting these reviews lies in the disclosure requirements - particularly the director attestation as to the adequacy of a bank’s risk management systems. These are all pleasing developments. We hope that they auger well for the success of the new arrangements. I am confident they will. But we are under no illusion that the new arrangements provide guarantees of financial system stability. Of course they do not. No system of banking supervision can do that. The most we are entitled to believe is that the disclosure regime will significantly reduce the likelihood of financial system instability in the future - at lower regulatory  compliance and taxpayer costs than other supervisory options might be expected to achieve. BIS Review /1997 - 10 - General Observations on Incorporating Market Disciplines into Banking Supervision Before I conclude this address  I should probably make some comments about the extent to which market disciplines could be better incorporated into the supervisory frameworks in other countries. I should first of all make it clear that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is not promoting the New Zealand supervisory model as the ideal model for other countries to adopt. We make no such claims. The model we have adopted meets our particular needs  but it might not necessarily be suitable for other countries. Clearly  each country needs to make its own judgement as to what type of supervisory framework is best suited to its unique requirements. That judgement will inevitably depend on many considerations  including: the objectives which banking supervision is expected to meet  and whether those objectives include depositor protection; the existence or otherwise of deposit insurance arrangements; the structure of the banking system; and the infrastructure within which banking operates  such as banking law and accounting standards. Having said this  I do believe that market disciplines can play a substantial role in most financial systems. In particular  I think policy makers in many countries could usefully give careful thought to the merits of introducing comprehensive and well focused disclosure requirements for banks. Similarly  I believe there would be much to gain from the adoption of policies designed to strengthen the responsibilities of bank directors  so that the ultimate responsibility for the management of banking risks lies squarely in the boardroom  rather than being awkwardly balanced between the banking supervisor and the bank director. But it is fair to say that the effectiveness of market disciplines will much depend on the structure of the regulatory arrangements in place and the nature of the infrastructure within which the banking system operates. In particular  the following factors would seem to play an important role in determining the effectiveness of using disclosure as a mechanism for promoting systemic stability. Market disciplines are more likely to be effective where governments do not insulate depositors from losses - whether explicitly in the form of deposit insurance or through implicit depositor protection. Understandably  depositors and other creditors are less likely to take an interest in a bank’s financial condition where they know  or have good cause to surmise  that they will be insulated from losses should a bank get into difficulty. In such circumstances  banks which are performing poorly are less likely to face adverse market reaction than in an environment where creditors operate under the expectation that they are likely to lose money in the event of a bank failure. In part  this is why  in New Zealand  we have eschewed deposit insurance or depositor protection  and have sought to make it clear to depositors  among others  that they should not expect the government to insulate them from losses in the event of a bank failure. It is also fair to say that market disciplines are more likely to be effective where the supervisory requirements applied to banks are kept to a minimum. I say this for two reasons. BIS Review /1997 - 11 - First  the greater the supervisory requirements  the more likely it is that the market will perceive that the government is underwriting individual banks. And second  the greater the supervisory requirements  the less likely it is that bank directors and management will view themselves as having ultimate responsibility for the management of their banks. The effectiveness of market disciplines will also depend on the structure of the financial system. In particular  it seems likely that market disciplines would be more effective where a bank is domestically owned - that is  where no other bank stands behind it. Where a bank is owned by another bank  the market would naturally have regard to the financial condition of the parent bank when assessing how it should react to disclosures made by the local bank. Market disciplines might therefore be somewhat more subdued in a financial system characterised by foreign ownership than in one dominated by locally owned banks. Having said this  I am fully satisfied that even in a financial system which is largely foreign owned  such as in the New Zealand financial system  there is very considerable scope to use market disciplines to promote improved risk management by the subsidiaries and branches of foreign banks. Indeed  it is possible that New Zealand’s disclosure regime might well be adding to the incentives on overseas parent banks to more vigilantly supervise their New Zealand operations and to give greater attention to their own financial condition. The extent of government ownership of the banking system is also likely to influence the effectiveness of market disciplines. I think we would all agree that the market is less likely to impose meaningful disciplines on a bank which is state owned than would be the case with a privately owned bank - assuming  of course  that the market has faith in the financial soundness and political stability of the government in question. However  even where a bank is state owned  a robust disclosure regime might well strengthen the accountability of the directors and management of the bank  leading to improved risk management within the bank. It will come as no surprise to you that I believe that market disciplines are more likely to be effective where banks are required to make comprehensive disclosures on a frequent and timely basis. The disclosure requirements should focus on the key aspects of a bank’s financial performance and risk profile  and should be made with sufficient frequency and timeliness as to provide the market with a meaningful basis for assessing a bank’s financial condition and comparing one bank with another. Disclosure is likely to be more meaningful and effective if it is supported by robust accounting standards which have the force of law. Certainly  in the case of New Zealand  we have found that our disclosure regime has been assisted greatly by the introduction of legally binding and more rigorously drafted accounting standards. Moreover  disclosure requirements should ideally be coupled with an appropriate legal framework governing bank directors - a framework designed to focus directors’ attention on their duties to manage the affairs of their bank in a sound manner  and to hold them to account for any breaches of those duties. However  as they say  there is a time and a place for everything. And so it is with disclosure. I think we would all agree that it would not be helpful to introduce new disclosure requirements at a time when the banking system is in a fragile state. Doing so could well exacerbate the situation. That is why  in New Zealand  we introduced the disclosure regime at a time when the financial system was in a strong position and therefore when disclosure would assist in maintaining confidence in the banking system  rather than detracting from it. Finally  the effectiveness of market disciplines through public disclosure will obviously be infrastructure within which banking operates. By “infrastructure”  I refer to such matters as: the nature and adequacy of corporate law; the influenced by the BIS Review /1997 - 12 - adequacy of accounting standards and auditing requirements; the sophistication and integrity of the accounting profession; and the adequacy of the financial news media and financial professionals. All else being equal  the more well developed the infrastructure  the more likely it is that market disciplines will be effective. This suggests that  in the case of some developing countries  where perhaps the infrastructure is not well developed  the scope for using disclosure to promote market disciplines is somewhat more limited than would otherwise be the case. But even in such cases  I would not dismiss the potential merits of developing relatively simple disclosure requirements  drawing on international accounting and auditing standards as appropriate  as a means of promoting some rudimentary market disciplines. Conclusion Let me conclude by reiterating my view that market disciplines can play a powerful role in promoting systemic stability  in conjunction with some degree of banking supervision. I think there is considerable scope for policy makers to give further thought to how market disciplines could be better used to reinforce the efforts of banking supervisors in the quest for systemic stability. However  in giving thought to this matter  it may well be necessary for policy makers to re-assess some fundamental aspects of the conventional approaches to banking supervision and their relationship to the promotion of market disciplines. These include such issues as depositor protection  deposit insurance  the extent of prudential regulation of banks  and the intensity with which banking supervision is conducted. These are all substantial issues of course  and I have little doubt that there will be continuing international debate as to where the appropriate balance should lie. I very much hope that the approach which we in New Zealand have adopted will assist in promoting international debate on supervisory options. BIS Review /1997

Duisenberg  President of the Netherlands Bank and of the Bank for International Settlements  on the occasion of the award of the prize for the “European Banker of the Year 1996” by the Group of 20+1 in Frankfurt on 3/3/97. I Being elected in Frankfurt is something rather special. I am not thinking so much of yesterday’s local elections. After all  for centuries Frankfurt was the venue of the election of the German King  and later on of the Holy Roman Emperor. Today  however  we are concerned not with the Emperor  but with the European Banker of the Year. And the votes were cast not by the seven princely Electors  but by the 21 margraves of the international economic press. By electing Wim Duisenberg as European Banker of the Year  the Group of 20+1 landed a triple coup. They honoured the individual: Duisenberg  the committed champion of stability. They honoured the institution: The Netherlands Bank  that stronghold of stability. And they honoured the nation. The Netherlands is today  in a sense  the model country - the shining example on the continent. II While others were still moaning about the flood of economic challenges  the Dutch were already starting to come to terms with them. They weeded out their social system. They increased the flexibility of their labour market; they encouraged part-time working  widened wage differentials  seized the opportunities presented by the services sector. To be sure  even the Netherlands still has some problems to contend with. But the adjustments are already paying off. Unemployment is falling. Employment is rising. And despite the difficult environment (and  by the way  also despite almost identical exchange rate movements to ours)  economic growth has turned out to be exceptionally resilient. The long-standing traditions of the Dutch are obviously still intact. After all  as seafarers and merchants  they have been obliged for centuries to satisfy the requirements of foreign markets. That is why today they are a good distance ahead of other countries in the adjustment process. I know  of course  that many of the Dutch are not very fond of eulogies of their success. Too much praise from outside might impede the domestic reform process. And we know very well that even long-standing “model pupils” have to take care to see that their marks remain good. But I believe the Dutch are sufficiently self-assured to be able to cope with praise  too. It is the ability to adjust flexibly that determines “the ascent and decline of nations”  and thus their currencies as well. The example of the Netherlands  in particular  shows BIS Review 27/1997 - 2 - that an internally and externally hard currency helps to create jobs. Admittedly  the political will to effect domestic adjustments  and the social consensus that they should be carried out  are also essential. The erstwhile pegging of the guilder to the D-Mark has long since given way to coexistence on equal terms. Nowadays it is not unfair to ask whether the guilder has not meanwhile itself become the new anchor currency in Europe. In a sense it has  at any rate jointly with the D-Mark. There are two reasons why the Netherlands has been able to assume this role of the guilder as the “co-anchor” in the ERM: First of all  an economic reason: the markets see that the Dutch are not dependent on importing their stability through the exchange rate link. Their “stability culture” stands firmly on its own feet. And secondly  a political reason: the Netherlands has played a crucial part in ensuring that the ERM exists at all in its present shape. This is because a critical situation arose in the summer of 1993  under the impact of upheavals in the ERM. In the monetary “summer gales” of those days  it was suggested at times that Germany should be relegated to the status of a spectator. But the Dutch refused to unpeg the guilder from the D-Mark. And the other member states then felt that the ERM was of no particular interest without those two. The unambiguous stance of Dutch economic and monetary policy is paying dividends. Today Dutch interest rates are below German rates  at both the short and the long end of the market  despite the slight increase in the last few days. Whether De Nederlandsche Bank is already the actual “interest-rate leader” in Europe is a question I would rather leave open. True  we at the Bundesbank know that we cannot  and do not wish to  permit ourselves any signs of laxity. But for the time being we do not think that the turning point for an upward interest rate adjustment lies with us. The Dutch success up to now has not been achieved overnight. It is the upshot of a long and consistent road which Wim Duisenberg has done a great deal to shape. III Wim Duisenberg comes from Friesland. What is puzzling is how he comes by the name of Duisen-berg. As you know  Friesland is so flat that you only need to stand on a newspaper to be able to overlook the entire countryside. Frisians are supposed to be very attached to their native locality  which is by no means the same thing as being “provincial”. And they are said to be  above all  indomitable  which the uninitiated sometimes interpret as “self-willed”. But that doesn’t matter. As you will know  such a characterisation is not entirely unknown for a Westphalian  either. That is hardly surprising. After all  our birth-places are only 120 kilometres apart. There were signs of Wim Duisenberg’s international vocation at an early age. As a student he was particularly interested in international economic relations. He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the topic: “The economic consequences of disarmament”. And he worked for the International Monetary Fund for five years. BIS Review 27/1997 - 3 - But then he responded to the call of his homeland. There was nowhere he was not needed. Economic research needed him. He became a professor of macroeconomics in Amsterdam. The government needed him. He became the Minister of Finance at an early age. Actually  that’s a contradiction in terms. Youth  after all  tends to be idealistic and impetuous  whereas age tends rather to be distrustful and wary. And a finance minister needs to be highly distrustful and wary. The banking industry needed him. He joined a commercial bank. And finally the central bank needed him. He became its Governor  which elicited from him the following comment: “It’s the best job ... The pity is that there’s only one such job per country.” Well  being Central Bank Governor in the Netherlands is a longer-term occupation. Anyway  I don’t know any other country that has had only three Governors in the past fifty years. His spell as Governor did not begin very auspiciously. Against his advice  the guilder was devalued against the D-Mark as part of the major realignment within the ERM in 1983. That was due less to economic calculation than to a political oversight. And at that time the youthful Governor was unable to get his way in all respects vis-à-vis the politicians. But the markets were resentful for a long while afterwards. In the course of the 1980s  however  the markets’ confidence was regained. And Wim Duisenberg played a major role in that  too. Wim Duisenberg’s professional life has meanwhile come full circle. The Dutchman who was always interested in the world at large has held a number of important international offices. For instance  he is now  for the second time  Chairman of the Board of the BIS in Basle. He is also the incoming EMI President; specifically  in Frankfurt. (I know he would have been only too glad to be EMI President in Amsterdam. But there his chances would certainly have been lower.) The newspaper Börsenzeitung wrote: “The new lion-tamer for the EMI”. And that would seem to make him the obvious candidate for the office of the future President of the European Central Bank. IV The boat of European monetary policy needs a shrewd and experienced captain. But  Wim  beware of the song of the sirens. In Europe  as you know  there is an island. There  some observers are loudly singing the praises of a specific financial culture which is claimed to be the only culture for the future. But that culture differs in some respects from continental financial culture. All I can say on that score is: Wim  stay on the continent! Continental (or should I say: German) financial culture is not as out-dated as some people make out. Long-termism is not to be equated with immobility or lack of flexibility. To be sure  the continent needs more flexibility - in the area of social security and on the labour market alike. But our financial sector is already flexible. After all  we do not want to mix up flexibility with volatility. It may well be the case that short-termism sometimes makes asset prices “more flexible”. But what matters is the financial sector’s capacity to come to terms with changed requirements in the economy. Long- termism is certainly no obstacle to that. Long-termism makes the seas less rough. That helps the central bank to stay on course and set the sails properly. And one day the European Central Bank will have to do just that. The expectations pinned on the courage and navigational skill of the future ECB Governing Council are high. But I am quite sure that  with you as Captain  the ECB crew will manage to manoeuvre the euro to an anchorage in the safe haven of monetary stability. In Germany the politicians are vowing that the euro will be as stable as the D-Mark has been. Actually  the BIS Review 27/1997 - 4 - guilder ought to be the reference point. For I can tell you: the German people will accept the euro only if it is every bit as stable as the guilder. The fact that there has long been a virtual monetary union between our two countries owes much to you. What we envisage is just such a stable monetary union on a larger scale. I am sure that that is your objective  too. We Governors of the other central banks will give you every assistance when you assume the presidency of the EMI in a few months’ time. I am convinced that you will prove a worthy successor to Alexandre Lamfalussy. And he  after all  has set a high standard. Wim  my good friend  I should like to congratulate you sincerely and cordially on having been elected European Banker of the Year 1996. Seen from the Frankfurt perspective  all I can add is: Frankfurt is such an interesting and attractive city that I would wish that you may remain here for longer than some 18 months  not only as European Banker of the Year 1996  but as central banker of Europe.

Duisenberg  on receiving the European Banker of the Year award in Frankfurt on 3/3/97.,Dr. Duisenberg responds to being made European Banker of the Year Brief speech by the President of the Netherlands Bank and of the Bank for International Settlements  Dr. W.F. Duisenberg  on receiving the European Banker of the Year award in Frankfurt on 3/3/97. First of all I would like to thank you for presenting me with the European Banker of the Year award. I must confess that apart from feeling highly honoured at having such a prize bestowed on me  I feel slightly surprised as well. It is not until 1st July of this year that I will be taking over the leadership of the EMI to become a veritable European Banker. There is something symbolic about this prize being presented in Frankfurt  which is not just the vibrant financial heart of Germany  but also the city where the monetary policy of the Economic and Monetary Union will be made. And it is about EMU that I wish to speak today. With the moment of deciding which Member States meet the criteria for accession to EMU creeping up on us  the discussion on EMU is increasingly centring on the question of how EMU is to be achieved rather than on whether EMU will be achieved. And rightly so  because the completion of EMU became a certainty when it was laid down in the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. EMU is to start off on 1st January 1999. In the spring of 1998 the Heads of Government of the European Union will decide which Member States meet the criteria for entry. By signing and ratifying the Treaty  Member States opted to join EMU as soon as they fulfil the criteria. Only the United Kingdom and Denmark insisted on an opt-out clause  releasing them from the obligation to introduce the euro upon qualifying for EMU. The completion of EMU is irreversible  the introduction of the euro definitive. When EMU takes off  all Member States participating in the euro area will be confronted with a fundamental change of environment. A proper start is of the utmost importance  with the euro being just as hard as the guilder or  if you will  the Deutsche mark. I need not explain to you the importance of low inflation  and hence of a strong currency. If we want the euro to be strong  there is nothing for it but to comply strictly with the convergence criteria. A weak euro and the attending high interest rate level would be of no benefit to anybody  and that includes the potential derogation countries. Please keep in mind that a monetary union with ill-converging Member States would be incapable of absorbing economic shocks. Ultimately the tensions attending a malfunctioning EMU would jeopardise the achievements of the Single Market. In my view  potential derogation countries should not even wish to take part in an EMU which allows insufficiently converged Member States to join. That brings me to the position of Member States with a derogation. At present many Member States are making desperate attempts to meet the convergence criteria for introduction of the euro. Nevertheless we must make allowance for the fact that a number of them will not be able to participate when EMU takes off on 1st January 1999. We should not make too much of their predicament. After all  a Member State with a derogation is not excommunicated  but will be allowed to join at a later date. If they succeed in meeting the convergence criteria within the near future  some of these countries will be able to join the core group when the euro banknotes and coins are introduced in 2002. Moreover  an exchange rate mechanism is presently being designed which seeks to ensure that the derogation countries retain close links with the core group. The mechanism will support their exchange rate policies. It aims to prevent unduly large exchange rate movements within the European Union which might impede the workings of the Single Market. At the same time  efforts will have to be made to reinforce convergence between the so-called BIS Review 27/1997 - 2 - ins and outs in Stage Three in order to promote the accession of the derogation countries. Here the pact for stability and growth can make a major contribution. Under the pact  the EU Member States  whether in or outside the euro area  commit themselves to strive for a near-balanced budget or even a budget surplus. In fact  the pact would bring about a return to the budgetary discipline adhered to before the deficits of many countries began to get out of hand in the 1970s and 1980s. A strong monetary union creates the right climate for low inflation. Low inflation  i.e. price stability  is the overriding objective of the ECB. Internal stability  meaning stable prices  is the principal aim. External stability  though not a primary objective  may ensue. There is after all a clear connection between a strong EMU with low inflation and the external value of the euro; it is in fact a precondition for a strong and stable euro. When the three large trade blocks  the US  Japan and Europe all pursue policies aiming for internal stability  they will not only reap the fruits domestically  but they will also contribute to a global climate of exchange rate stability. One of the main reasons for exchange rate disturbances  viz. an inconsistent and insufficiently confidence-inspiring policy  would thus be removed. The importance of reasonably stable exchange rates all over the world brings me to the international position of the euro. Let me conclude with a few remarks on that score. Obviously an economy stands to benefit materially when its currency evolves into an international key currency. A country whose currency figures in large numbers of transactions elsewhere faces far fewer exchange rate risks  while its financial sector is given a major boost. A currency circulating within private sectors outside its own country brings in income for its issuer  the so-called seigniorage. The euro is well placed to play an important role as an international currency. Such a position is  however  not acquired overnight  but will have to be won gradually. However  several major conditions for such a position in the longer term are already fulfilled. The European single market  encompassing 350 million inhabitants  offers a solid foundation for the euro. Another condition is the existence of sophisticated financial markets. Building up on the position attained by the Deutsche mark  the euro’s prospects are good in this respect. And last but not least  the euro will have to be a strong and stable currency. Only a hard currency will make it in the international financial markets. With the euro’s future role as an international currency in mind  let us make sure that EMU starts off with really converged economies  so that the ECB will be able to realise its objective of price stability without having to resort to overly painful policy measures. That will enable the euro to become a prominent international currency. BIS Review 27/1997

Duisenberg  on the occasion of a dinner hosted by the Board of Directors of the 'Association for the Monetary Union of Europe' (AMUE)  at Kasteel De Wittenburg  Wassenaar  4/3/97.,Dr. Duisenberg assesses the future importance of the euro Address by the President of the Bank for International Settlements  the Netherlands Bank and of Dr. W.F. Duisenberg  on the occasion of a dinner hosted by the Board of Directors of the ‘Association for the Monetary Union of Europe’ (AMUE)  at Kasteel De Wittenburg  Wassenaar  4/3/97. 1 It is a great pleasure for me to be able to address you here tonight in Wassenaar. Your Association has always been among the strongest supporters for speeding up European integration  particularly Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). This emphatic support gives the speaker the luxurious feeling of playing before a home audience. 2 Tonight  I would like to ponder two issues related to the future importance of the euro. First  what are the chances of the euro becoming an important reserve and invoicing currency? Second  how should the European Central Bank deal with the external value of the euro? Future role of the euro as a reserve and invoicing currency 3 I know that the first issue - the future role of the euro as a reserve and invoicing currency - has been receiving a lot of attention from your Association over the years. As a matter of fact  you very strongly believe in a powerful role for the euro. I quote from your latest report: “By placing Europe in a much stronger position vis-à-vis the United States of America and other countries  the introduction of the euro improves investor climate and ultimately favours employment. Also  the use of the euro will rapidly develop world-wide  in proportion to the external trade of the European Union which already ranks first in the world”. I very much welcome this positive approach to the euro. The internationalization of the euro is only partly in the hands of European policy-makers. Policy-makers can provide for the right incentives by pursuing sound policies  thereby making their currency attractive. But  at the same time  the success of the euro is also in the hands of the markets. In this respect  I would encourage the European business community to take every opportunity to promote the private use of the euro and increase its role as a vehicle currency and store of value. 4 Let me elaborate a little by discussing three major factors that will determine the future importance of the euro: the stability of the euro  the amount of trade conducted in it  and the depth of euro financial markets. Safeguarding the stability of the euro is the biggest responsibility of the European Central Bank. The safest currency for all investors is the currency of the country with the lowest inflation rate over time. Here  the prospects for the euro are good. Over the years  inflation in European core countries has been constantly lower than in the United States  and there is no reason to believe that this would change with the start of EMU. It is also very important that the euro will be strengthened by the institutional independence of the European Central Bank and its objectives of price stability. Furthermore  safeguards have been put in place  such as the Stability Pact  to prevent EMU countries from pursuing unhealthy fiscal policies. All in all  I firmly believe that the euro will be a strong currency. 5 As regards the other major determinants of the future importance of the euro - trade and financial markets - the role policy-makers can play is more limited. This is not to say that the euro’s starting position is unfavourable. On the contrary  over the last twenty years international private portfolios have been gradually diversified in the direction of European currencies. Also  European currencies have been increasingly used as vehicle and  to a lesser extent  as invoicing currencies. There is every reason to believe that these trends could be strengthened by the introduction of the euro. After all  the euro will eventually cover an BIS Review 27/1997 - 2 - economy whose gross domestic product is larger than that of the United States. If intra-EU trade is excluded  the EU and the US both account for around 20 percent of world trade. Furthermore  with 350 million inhabitants the EU is the largest consumer market in the OECD area  consumers whose needs will partly have to be met by trading with the rest of the world. Companies which trade principally with European counterparties may be inclined to invoice and pay in euros. If the euro is going to be widely used in international trade transactions  exporters and importers within the European Union will no longer be exposed to exchange rate risks nor have to hedge against such risks. The European business community thus has ample opportunities to reap the benefits provided by the introduction of the euro. 6 It is more difficult to predict the future role of the euro in international financial markets. Fortunately  at the European level agreement has been reached on legal provisions that guarantee the continuity of ECU contracts. This provides a good starting point for euro capital markets. Ultimately  however  the choice of currency in which to borrow and lend depends on the depth and liquidity of the underlying market. Presumably  some segments of the euro market will become deeper. For instance  government bond markets are likely to become deeper and more liquid  and will offer international investors more instruments than current national markets. It is also important that experience in the last few years has shown that financial markets can put increasing pressure on political authorities to conduct prudent macroeconomic policies. In such an environment  governments can no longer afford to outrun the constable  and credit spreads between different debtors may in practice be rather small. The external value of the euro 7 Let me now briefly discuss the issue of the external value of the euro. Recently  there has been a great deal of attention on this issue. Should the ECB  for instance  set an exchange rate target vis-à-vis the dollar? In my view  this is not the appropriate way to go. The primary task of the ECB is to guarantee internal price stability. As I have mentioned earlier  the euro area will have an economic and commercial weight comparable to that of the United States. This means a huge  but relatively closed economy. With a low import ratio  the effect of exchange rate movements on internal price developments will be limited compared to what currently holds for individual EU countries. Therefore  it is simply wiser for the ECB to focus on euro-wide indicators  such as money growth for the whole euro area. Put differently  the internal value of the euro is the objective of monetary policy and the external value the outcome. 8 This is not to say  of course  that Europe could adopt an attitude of benign neglect with regard to the external value of the euro. As is the case now  exchange rate developments will continue to be informally monitored by the major global players. Indeed  the introduction of the euro may even enhance the opportunity for strengthened policy coordination. With Europe speaking with one voice  the players on the global field are being put on a more equal footing. This could add to globally balanced and stable policies  which is in the interest of the three poles concerned. Furthermore  there is the relationship between the euro and the currencies of those countries which will not participate in EMU from the beginning. A new Exchange Rate Mechanism has been designed which aims to ensure that the EU Member States stay together and that the working of the Internal Market is not frustrated by exchange rate fluctuations between the euro zone and other EU currencies. It will also help those countries which will not join EMU right from the start to orient their policies towards convergence  in order to enable them to qualify for participation as soon as possible. BIS Review 27/1997 To conclude... - 3 - ...  there are reasons to believe that over time the euro could develop into an important reserve and invoicing currency. Good opportunities for the euro arise from the fact that the EU economy is even larger than that of the United States. Furthermore  it is the responsibility of European policy-makers to safeguard the attractiveness of the European currency by pursuing sound policies. In this respect  the stability of the euro is in the good hands of the ECB. At the same time  I would like to emphasize that the success of the euro is also in the hands of the markets. It should be borne in mind that it took the dollar half a century and two world wars to replace sterling as the international currency  despite the fact that the United States had been the major economic power since the beginning of this century. All in all  these are challenging times for Europe. Let me  therefore  propose a toast to the future success of the euro. BIS Review 27/1997

It is a pleasure to be with you this afternoon as you discuss some of the most fundamental issues raised by our new information and communications technologies. The topic Senator Bennett has asked us all to address is privacy in the information age. The central dilemma in these discussions almost always involves fundamental choices about how to strike prudent balances among the needs of individuals for privacy in their financial and commercial transactions  as well as their personal communications; the needs of commerce to bring us new products and new means to communicate; and the needs of the authorities to provide for the effective administration of government and to ensure the public safety. These are not easy choices. I think we all need to have a healthy respect for all sides of the debate. Even further  we need to be aware that the balances we strike in one era may need to be reexamined as technology and circumstances change. The dictionary defines privacy as the state of being free from unsanctioned intrusion. This concept  to which Americans feel a very deep-seated attachment  is reflected in the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution  which assures “The right of the people to be secure in their persons  houses  papers  and effects  against unreasonable searches and seizures....” For the government to intrude on one’s privacy is in a very fundamental sense a deprivation of freedom. It is one of those deeply sensed issues that transcends people’s constitutional or legal views and delves into the realm of one’s sense of person. This is why the perceived threat to privacy from burgeoning technological advance  coupled with an increasing sense of inefficacy in the face of sophisticated new technologies  has created such a stir. The fears of invasion of privacy  as a consequence of inexorable forces seemingly out of the control of the average American  has risen to a major public policy issue. A half century ago a number of writers expressed concern at a perceived ever widening intrusion of government into the lives of individuals. They feared the ultimate collectivization of our society where individualism would be significantly diminished or expunged  and the emergence of “Big Brother” would come to define and dominate our lives. 1984  the year  as well as the book made famous by George Orwell in 1949  have come and gone. The outreach of government  if anything  has receded  especially with respect to the issues of personal liberty  and its concomitant  personal privacy. I suspect that the fear of “Big Technology” when it arrives will travel the less threatening route of “Big Brother” before it. In preparation for addressing that issue  I believe it would be useful to examine some of the interesting dimensions of the concept of privacy and its application to how human society arranges itself. Indeed  when it comes to the issue of privacy  humans are distinctly ambivalent. Greta Garbo made an institution of wanting to be alone. Yet  at the same time  human beings have always sought and presumably needed the presence of others in organizing their societies  even before we economists came on the scene to inform them about the benefits of the division of labor. BIS Review 28/1997 - 2 - But the various paradigms by which we have chosen to organize ourselves were closely tied to how we viewed the relative value of individualism and its precondition  the implicit need for privacy. In recent generations  the major competing forms of government  of course  have been (1) a system based on individual rights with the role of the state largely directed at protecting those rights (the United States being the most prominent example of that form of government) and (2) the now defunct Soviet Union  and its eastern European satellites  which were the model of communist collectivization. In the latter  the individual was theoretically subject to the will of the collective but  in reality  subjugated by an elite autocratic hierarchy. In the Soviet system  rights inhered in the collective  which immediately dismisses by definition any right to privacy. State intrusiveness in the form of the KGB or the Stasi eviscerated any wall of personal separation that citizens may have sought. But  in the end  that form of government did not  probably could not  succeed. The human need for personal expression  property  and privacy  doubtless were significant in undermining those collectivist states. Indeed  since the end of World War II  we have had as close as one can come to a controlled experiment in the comparative effectiveness of alternate forms of government organization. I refer to the extraordinary divergence in post-war recovery patterns observed between West and East Germany. Both were rooted in the same historic culture and institutions  differing virtually only in the form of political and economic organization  which were adopted by those societies at war’s end. Almost a half-century later  when the Berlin Wall was torn down  the results of this remarkable experiment vividly and unqualifiedly attested to the superiority of the West German free market system based on individual rights  a system where people lived with minimum fear of the state’s intrusion into their daily lives. In East Germany  in contrast  to assure that society was appropriately collectivized  it was necessary to probe into the private lives of all individuals and suppress individual freedoms. Human beings had to be molded by force to achieve the East German leaders’ distorted view of societal organization. Privacy was scarcely the goal or purpose of the East German state. Indeed  intrusiveness into the lives of all of the citizens was perceived to be an essential ingredient in its organization. The political and economic results of the post-war competition between East and West generally have been unequivocal. The free market capitalism of West Germany has been judged superior in all relevant respects  with very few dissenting from that conclusion. The human need for privacy surely was a major factor in that outcome. To be sure  our newer information technologies can scarcely be perceived as the type of threat to privacy as that of the Soviet state. Nonetheless  the same pressing need for privacy  which helped upend the Soviet Union  can be expected to address and overcome concerns that our newer technologies will intrude on our cherished need for privacy. Communism fell because its practice eliminated personal incentives to work and to acquire property  except in a very limited sense. The existence of such incentives requires the broad freedoms we enjoy to pursue our myriad personal goals. It was the deprivation of these incentives and the suppressing of competition among individuals  the hallmark of a growing economy  which brought Communism down. Since privacy is such an evident value in our society  where technology threatens that value  entrepreneurs can be counted on to seek means to defend it. The major resources they have devoted to encryption in the development of new communication systems attest to the economic value they place on privacy in communications. Moreover the pressures to enact legal BIS Review 28/1997 - 3 - prohibitions on the dissemination of personal records will also create incentives to produce technologies that protect them. Indeed  the most effective means to counter technology’s erosion of privacy is technology itself. The marketplace is burgeoning with new devices to this end. These devices  of course  include the many advances for encrypting and filtering information. We may even see the deployment of technologies that permit individuals to make choices calibrating their degree of privacy in conducting individual transactions. With some irony  even some of the ability of the government to pursue protection of individual rights is being impaired by effective encryption. This leads to the important question of how to balance the legitimate expectations of individuals for privacy with the needs of government for information to effectively administer the laws and provide for the public safety. The most delicate care is needed in this regard to prevent unnecessary intrusion when specific government decisions are implemented and to avoid the risk of a gradual  long-term erosion of privacy. Beyond these issues are immediate questions about privacy in the delivery of professional  commercial  and financial services over open computer networks as well as personal communications through devices such as e-mail. For example  there are typically strong assumptions about privacy surrounding medical  legal  and financial communications and records. These assumptions are designed to safeguard the autonomy of the individual and to facilitate a society where special expertise can be developed and called upon  when necessary  to promote the individual’s welfare. It would be a strange outcome  indeed  if traditional notions of privacy applied only at the physical office of the doctor  lawyer  or banker  but not when modern computer technologies were employed to make professional services available at lower cost and with greater convenience. It may be that some services and communications channels will be used regardless of what privacy guarantees are provided. Providing medical advice by computer network to rural areas with no resident doctors may be one example. More common services  however  such as certain cellular telephone technologies and the use of e-mail over the Internet  are subject to less privacy than some other modes of communication  although extensive efforts are currently being directed to address that. The growing use of credit cards without security measures to pay for goods and services over open networks is another example. Clearly  as these examples demonstrate  privacy concerns may be outweighed  if only for the moment  by other factors such as cost and convenience. However  given choices in the marketplace that include price  quality and differing degrees of privacy  I have little doubt that privacy would be valued and sought after. In the financial sphere  the payment systems of the United States present a paradox. Our systems  and banking arrangements  for handling high-value dollar payments are all electronic and have been for many years. Banking records  including those for loans and deposits  have been computerized since the 1960s. Securities markets also now rely on highly automated records and systems  born out of necessity following the paperwork crisis of the 1970s. Thus  it might seem strange that in transactions initiated by consumers  paper -- currency and checks -- remains the payment system of choice. Debit and ATM cards  along with automated clearing house payments  account for a very small percentage of transactions. Even BIS Review 28/1997 - 4 - the use of popular credit cards has only recently begun to challenge paper’s dominance. While there are many other factors involved in this anomaly  the value of privacy of transaction has clearly been a significant determinant. Paper currency is  of course  the ultimate protector of anonymity  for making ordinary payments at the retail level. It is  thus  a measure of how valued is privacy in our system that inroads into the use of currency have been slow  and halting  in the face of technologies one would assume would have quickly buried the presumed inefficiency of paper transactions. To be sure  checks leave a paper trail which can compromise privacy  but it is a less efficient and accessible trail than when available newer technologies are used. Clearly  then  the value of privacy of transactions that currency -- and to a somewhat lesser extent  checks -- provide is a measure of the economic cost individuals are willing to expend when far superior efficiencies are at hand. Nonetheless  the marketplace is currently investing large sums to develop new means to automate payments as well as other retail banking and financial transactions. Projects for creating stored value cards and Internet-based payment systems  for example  are being discussed around the world. Again  as in the 1970s  articles are being written and conferences are being held to pronounce the end of paper. They may again prove premature. It is clear  however  that security and privacy will be very important if confidence is to be established in these new systems. Indeed  in many  privacy of communication is a necessary requirement. Many projects are evolving daily to meet the business requirements of potential operators and the potential service needs of businesses and consumers. There is a significant need for flexibility in allowing these technologies to adapt and grow in response to pressures in the marketplace. There is also a need to avoid building formal or burdensome regulatory systems on the shifting sands of project proposals. If we wish to foster innovation  we must be careful not to impose rules that inhibit it. I am especially concerned that we not attempt to impede unduly our newest innovation  electronic money  or more generally  our increasingly broad electronic payments system. To develop new forms of payment  the private sector will need the flexibility to experiment  without broad interference by the government. Our most intriguing challenge is whether new technologies can provide improved financial services and  at the same time  provide greater privacy and related benefits. Flexibility by industry  consumers  and government may help make such overall advances possible. Finally  I want to emphasize that the information age is not something to be feared  but may well be a vast opportunity. Personal computers  an array of software  and new communications channels have placed powerful and creative technologies directly into the hands of individuals. The current enthusiasm of society for science and technology  particularly among young people  holds great promise for the future. If history is any guide  it is from this enthusiasm that the future will be born. BIS Review 28/1997

V. Reddy  at the Administrative Staff College in Hyderabad on 8/3/97. 1. It is a pleasure for me to be with you in the Administrative Staff College today. I have my gurus here  and I also have many friends. I spent a year on a full-time basis about a decade ago as Visiting Faculty here. I am thankful to the Principal for giving me an opportunity to speak on an important subject of contemporary relevance. 2. Mr.Chidambaram’s budget of 1997 has been widely acclaimed as a trail- blazing breaking budget. From the point of view of Reserve Bank of India  it has very significant implications. The budget has acknowledged that interest tax is a bad tax and has commenced its phasing out. It has removed tax deduction at source on Government securities which was an irritant in developing an active secondary market for Government securities. The Government has accepted RBI’s proposal to launch a capital indexed bond. In the external sector  the policy of capital outflows has been liberalised  acknowledging that globalisation is not a one-way street. Replacing the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and designing a process of capital account convertibility are two of the announcements in the budget which are very dear subjects to me  but I will not comment on them. A Working Group and a Committee in the RBI are working on them and I cannot pre-empt their conclusions. There is  however  one subject which has generated debate  sometimes based on misinformation if not misunderstanding. That is the elimination of ad hoc Treasury bills Treasury bills and the introduction of a new system of Ways and Means Advances (WMA). My predecessor  Dr. S.S.Tarapore  who played a significant part in pursuing this idea  has described this change-over as a watershed in Indian monetary history. The origin of ad hoc Treasury bills 3. The intellectual origins of ad hoc Treasury bills in their present form can be traced to the First Five Year Plan. It said  “Judicious credit creation somewhat in anticipation of the increase in production and availability of genuine savings has also a part to play”. Thus  deficit financing  which in our context meant RBI credit to the Government  was assigned a place in the financing of the Plan though its volume was to be limited to the extent that it was non-inflationary. 4. The ad hoc Treasury bills thus emerged as a mode of financing the Central Government’s deficit in the mid-1950s. For the smooth conduct of Government business  it was mutually agreed between the Central Government and the RBI that a minimum cash balance of Rs.50 crore on Fridays and Rs.4 crore on other days would be held by the Central Government. To adhere to this administrative arrangement  it was agreed that the Reserve Bank would replenish the Government’s cash balances by the creation of ad hoc Treasury bills in favour of the Reserve Bank. The ad hoc Treasury bills  which were meant to be temporary  gained a permanent as well as a cumulative character. Indeed  it became an attractive source of financing Government expenditures since it was available at an interest rate pegged at 4.6 per cent per annum since 1974  i.e. actually at a negative real interest rate. The assault on ad hoc Treasury bills 5. The Committee to Review the Working of the Monetary System recommended that the Reserve Bank adopt a system of monetary targeting with feedback. The target is to be BIS Review 28/1997 - 2 - fixed taking into account the growth of the real sector and an acceptable order of increase in prices. The adherence to the target implied a limit to the monetisation of the Government’s deficit. After all  any investment in Central Government securities by the RBI results in the monetisation of Government’s deficit  as the RBI’s credit to the Government is a source of reserve money generation. 6. Dr. Rangarajan  our Governor  brought out the ill-effects of the automatic monetisation of the Government deficit through ad hoc Treasury bills in his Presidential Address at the Annual Conference of the Indian Economic Association in December  1988. He has been pursuing this subject with missionary zeal since then. Analysing fiscal and monetary interactions  he brought out the following issues. First  the scale of Government borrowing was maintained at a high level and surpluses on revenue account have given way to deficits. Second  such borrowing has been at less than market rates. Third  even the growing captive investors in Government securities such as commercial banks were not willing to subscribe beyond their statutory obligations. Fourth  the RBI as the manager of public debt became the residual subscriber. Fifth  since the Government incurred deficits year after year  the question of the retirement of Treasury bills did not arise. Sixth  the expansionary impact of these deficits  after taking into account the movements in net foreign exchange assets  had to be countered. Seventh  to counter the impact  open market operations were not possible given the interest rate structure. Eighth  this meant that the cash reserve ratio had to be increased to absorb the excess liquidity. Finally  when ad hoc Treasury bills were created automatically to finance the Central Government’s deficit without any limit  the system contributed to rapid monetary expansion when the budget deficit became very large. Dr.Rangarajan concluded his analysis with a solution  i.e. an agreement between the Government and the Reserve Bank of India setting a limit each year on the size of the fiscal deficit and its monetisation. This agreement would provide greater manoeuvrability to the RBI to regulate the volume of money. Monetary targeting would then be meaningful. What we have arrived at today in the budget of 1997 is exactly what was envisaged in 1988. The process of elimination 7. The process of the elimination of ad hoc Treasury bills has been designed in three stages : First  through limits on the creation of ad hoc Treasury bills which operated between 1994-95 and 1996-97. BIS Review 28/1997 - 3 - Second  through a transition period of two years beginning April 1  1997  when ad hoc Treasury bills are eliminated and the new system of Ways and Means Advances is introduced; but  overdrafts above Ways and Means would be permissible beyond ten continuous working days  though at a cost. Third  the full-fledged system of Ways and Means Advances operates effective April 1999. We have completed the first phase  agreed on the second and third phases and are commencing the transition period  viz.  the second phase from April 1997. The second and third phases would become operational through a fresh agreement between the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India. Incidentally  the arrangements for WMA to state governments are also based on agreements between the Reserve Bank of India with state Governments. The experience with the first phase 8. In September 1994  it was mutually agreed between the Government and the RBI that limits will be placed on the net issue of ad hoc Treasury bills for year-end and also within the year. The year-end limits of Rs.6 000 crore for 1994-95 and Rs.5 000 crore for the next two years were fixed. The within-the-year limit during this period was kept at Rs.9 000 crore. During 1994-95  the net issue of ad hoc Treasury bills during the greatest part of the year was negative and even at the end of the year the net issue was only Rs.1 750 crore  much lower than the year-end cap. During the years 1995-96 and 1996-97  though  there was some difficulty in staying below the within-the-year limits; it may be noted that during 1996-97  since August 14  1996  net issues of ad hoc Treasury bills remained mostly below the within- the-year limit. The most significant part of this agreement was that the practice of issuing ad hoc Treasury bills to finance the Central Government’s deficit would be totally discontinued by 1997-98. In last year’s budget  the Government committed itself to announcing concrete proposals for phasing out ad hoc Treasury bills. This year  the Finance Minister did exactly what he promised - to comply with the agreement. 9. A question that is often asked is what happens to the ad hoc Treasury bills outstanding? The outstanding level of ad hoc Treasury bills as at end-March 1997 will have to be funded into special securities at an interest rate of 4.6 per cent per annum. These securities  in addition to the volume of funded securities of Rs.71 000 crore already in the books of the RBI  will continue to be held by the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank at a later stage may have to use these securities for open market operations by converting them into marketable lots. The New System 10. What will the proposed system be like? First  a scheme of WMA by the Reserve Bank of India to Government of India (GOI) has been evolved to accommodate temporary mismatches in Government receipts and payments. Second  the limit for WMA and the rate of interest on WMA will be mutually agreed between the RBI and the Government from time to time. BIS Review 28/1997 - 4 - Third  any withdrawals by the Government from the Reserve Bank of India in excess of the limit of WMA would be permissible only for ten consecutive working days. Fourth  when 75 per cent of WMA is utilised  the Reserve Bank would trigger a fresh floatation of Government securities. Fifth  consistent with the discontinuance of ad hoc Treasury bills  the system of 91 days tap Treasury bills will also be discontinued with effect from April 1  1997. Sixth  with the discontinuance of ad hoc Treasury bills and tap Treasury bills and the introduction of WMA  the concept of the conventional budget deficit loses its relevance. Therefore  it is proposed to discontinue the practice of showing the budgetary deficit; instead the gross fiscal deficit would become the key indicator of the deficit. As a transparent way of reporting the monetised deficit  or net RBI Credit to the central Government  the likely extent of RBI support in respect of dated securities and auction Treasury bills is shown separately as the ‘monetised deficit’ in the budget document. Ad hoc Treasury bills and WMA: differences 11. There are significant differences between ad hoc Treasury bills and WMA. First  WMA will not be a source of financing the budget deficit. It is only a mechanism to cover day-to-day mismatches in receipts and payments of the Government. Therefore  the use of WMA will have to be periodically suspended. WMA will also not be shown as a source of financing in the budget estimates. Secondly  limits on WMA will be fixed and any excess withdrawal by the Government beyond the limit will become permissible for no more than 10 consecutive working days. Thirdly  WMA will be charged at a market related interest rate. The transition period 12. It is possible to argue that the period of agreement between 1994-97 itself was a transition and a further transition now is not necessary. However  the introduction of a fundamental change in a public system requires that functionaries in a variety of organisations in Government change procedures and cash management practices. This simply cannot happen like a dress rehearsal before the new system. In fact  some minor modifications may be needed as we go along. To say that transition is meant to dilute implies a predisposition to suspect the motives. After all  the change-over from the old system to new system should be smooth. The Government should evolve expenditure control mechanisms and improve its day-to-day cash management. It may be necessary for the Government to discuss with major ministries for this purpose. The Reserve Bank would also attempt to streamline its debt management techniques. The RBI will make efforts to develop the Treasury bills market by proactive participation and issuing of Treasury bills of different maturities. Therefore  a transition period of two years has been proposed. During the transition period  the Government would be allowed to exceed the limit of WMA for periods beyond 10 consecutive working days. But  additional interest will be applied for such periods on the amount of overdraft. The current debate BIS Review 28/1997 - 5 - 13. Following the announcement of the new system and the presentation of the budget incorporating the new system there has been a debate on the features of the system as well as its functioning in 1997-98. First  that it is only a new name for the old system. Second  that without a statutory ceiling on debt  the system will serve no purpose. Third  that the degree of autonomy for monetary policy is still limited. Fourth  that the budgeted figures show that the new system will involve large borrowings and more monetisation and  therefore  is inflationary. Let me analyse each one of the issues. 14. As already explained  the new system implies the repayment of advances made and not their accumulation year after year. The limits are fixed and exceeding the limits is simply not permitted beyond ten days once the system becomes fully functional. There is a cost of using such advances which is market-related. In addition  there is also the important advantage of providing mechanisms for open market operations to take care of surges in inflows of foreign capital. This is difficult under a system of ad hoc Treasury bills but is possible when auction Treasury bills and dated securities take the place of ad hoc Treasury bills. Market-based instruments are absolutely essential as we move along the path of capital account liberalisation. Further  the system is far more binding and transparent since the level of borrowings and the pattern of financing  especially RBI’s contribution  are made part of budget documents. Finally  the mixed bag that budget deficit represents is replaced by a more transparent method. 15. Perhaps it is necessary to clarify the three concepts viz. the budget deficit  the monetised deficit or the net RBI credit to the Government and the RBI’s support in primary issues of central Government securities. The budget deficit is defined as the total of the net issue of 91-day Treasury bills (at face value) - ad hoc Treasury bills Treasury bills  tap and auction - net of increases in central Government balances during the financial year. Therefore  conceptually  the budget deficit is the short-term financing availed of by the central Government both from the Reserve Bank and other entities which include banks  financial institutions  state Governments  corporates and other parties. In this set-up  the Reserve Bank is only one of the financing units of the budget deficit. Net reserve bank credit to the central Government  on the other hand  includes not only the Reserve Bank’s holdings of 91-day Treasury bills but also its holdings of dated securities and rupee coins net of the increase in the central Government’s cash balances. In other words  the Reserve Bank’s holdings of 91-day Treasury bills that forms a part of budget deficit is also a subset of the monetised deficit. However  it may be noted that while the constituents of the budget deficit are measured at face value  those of the net Reserve Bank credit to the central Government are measured at book value. This valuation difference is  however  negligible particularly for 91-day Treasury bills. The correlation between the budget deficit and the monetised deficit grows weaker at times of easy liquidity such as during the current financial year as absorption by the market of Government securities including 91-day Treasury bills has gone up substantially. The purchase of Government securities by non-RBI entities reduces the monetised deficit in two ways : (i) directly by reducing the devolvement on the Reserve Bank of 91-day Treasury bills and dated securities auctions as well as through the sale of dated securities including repos and BIS Review 28/1997 - 6 - ii) indirectly  as the market off-take of tap Treasury bills and fresh Government securities improves the central Government’s cash balances and reduces the central Government’s recourse to ad hoc Treasury bills. 16. The RBI’s support to primary issues of central Government securities reflects only its support in the primary offers  and net RBI credit to the Government could be very different due to other factors. Let me illustrate this with some figures. In 1993-94  the RBI’s support to Government was Rs.7 014 crore  but net RBI credit was only Rs.260 crores. In 1996-97  till February 14th  RBI’s support was Rs.12 099 crore  but  net RBI credit was only Rs.7 837 crore. The monetised deficit is one source of the money supply and is not the only factor affecting the money supply. 17. It is sometimes argued that the real instrument for fiscal prudence should be a statutory ceiling on debt. True  our constitution enables Parliamentary legislation relating to a ceiling on debt. The Ministry of Finance is due to bring out a Discussion Paper on this. Let me not pre-empt its content. But  clearly the new system has merits of its own and will co-exist more effectively with a ceiling on debt. It has merits in itself since it seeks to limit the extent of the RBI’s support. Technically  there is nothing to stop the Government from accessing all the debt within the ceiling from the RBI if the new system did not exist. A ceiling on debt provides a constraint on the broader issue of debt management and impinges on fiscal policy more directly. The new system tackles the issue of fiscal/monetary interface which is a critical component of both fiscal and monetary policies. 18. It is sometimes argued that the degree of autonomy for monetary policy is still limited. To the extent the limits on WMA interest costs and the RBI’s support to the Government are negotiable during the transition  there is room for the Government to influence the RBI. The main difference is that under the earlier system of automatic monetisation the Government could unilaterally determine the limits  while after the new system becomes fully functional  the pattern similar to state Governments would be followed. The data in the budget for 1997-98 are quoted to show that the RBI has not gained in autonomy. That leads me to an analysis of these figures and the inflationary potential of the borrowing programme and the pattern of financing. 19. In the current debate  some have presumed that as per budget estimates  the increase in high-powered money for 1997-98 would consist of Rs. 16 000 crore (the monetised deficit) plus Rs.7 000 crore on account of the increase in the average level of WMA. This presumption is wrong for two reasons: First  the budget estimates for monetised deficit at Rs.16 000 crore would consist of the increase in RBI’s holdings of Government securities including dated Government securities and the RBI’s holdings of auctioned Treasury bills. Second  the budget estimates for 1997-98 have not assumed any contribution to the budget from WMA. It may be mentioned that Rs.100 000 crore has been shown on both the receipts side and the disbursements side  implying that whatever WMA were taken by the Government would be repaid before the end of the year. 20. Some others have argued that there is a large increase in net borrowings of Government  of the order of 33 per cent  negating the intentions of the new system. Here again  the comparison between the net market borrowing figures of Rs.25 498 crore for 1996-97 and Rs.33 820 crore for 1997-98 is misleading. The figure for 1996-97 excludes financing through BIS Review 28/1997 - 7 - the budget deficit i.e.  mainly through the instrument of 91-day Treasury bills including ad hoc Treasury bills. The figures of 1997-98 under market borrowings would include borrowings through 91-day (auction) Treasury bills. Therefore  the comparable figures would be Rs.32 398 crore for 1996-97 [(Rs.25 498 crore of net market borrowing plus Rs.6 900 crore of the budget deficit (RE)] and Rs.33 820 crore for 1997-98 (total net market borrowing)  implying an increase of only 4.4 per cent. 21. Some others have argued that  at 16 per cent  the growth in the money supply would imply an inflation of 10 per cent if GDP grows at 6 per cent. The money supply growth indicated here is in terms of broad money and not narrow money. The income elasticity of demand for broad money which has been proven to be reasonably stable and is in the range of 1.5 to 1.6 in India should be taken into account. Even accepting that growth in GDP will be no more than 6 per cent  the implied inflation could be only between 7.0 per cent (16.0 - 9.0 ) and 6.4 per cent (16.0 - 9.6). Outlook new system. 22. Let me conclude with the outlook for the successful implementation of the First  let us recognise that what we are doing is really adhering to what the First Five Year Plan visualised  viz. judicious credit creation. Second  we are trying to operationalise the monetary targeting that Prof. Sukhamoy Chakravarthy's Committee wanted us to. No doubt  we have to move to indirect instruments of monetary policy  but we cannot escape some sort of effective monetary targeting. Third  a process of thinking initiated by Dr. Rangarajan in 1988  further elaborated by him into a proposal in the Kutty Memorial Lecture on “Autonomy of Central Banks” in September 1993  and formalised through an agreement between him as Governor and Prof. Manmohan Singh as Finance Minister has been honoured by our present Finance Minister Shri P. Chidambaram. We therefore have reason to believe that there is a consensus on the new system. Fourthly  the critics have not questioned the need for closer fiscal monetary interaction or a more autonomous monetary policy. If at all  the critics want to make sure that the new system works effectively towards its objectives. Finally  what has been put in place is a system and undoubtedly a better system than ad hoc Treasury bills and is certainly more suited to our times as well as our policies in the external sector. How it operates depends on public opinion  economic compulsions and the good faith with which this is implemented by the Government and the Reserve Bank of India. BIS Review 28/1997

George  at the Liverpool and District Bankers' Institute Bi-Annual Dinner in Liverpool on 12/3/97.,Mr. George looks at the prospects for the UK economy and developments towards European Monetary Union Speech by the Governor of the Bank of England  Mr. E.A.J. George  at the Liverpool and District Bankers’ Institute Bi-Annual Dinner in Liverpool on 12/3/97. It is a very enjoyable - and vital - part of our job at the Bank of England to keep in touch with what is going on around the country. And we work quite hard at it - through visits like this one; through our non-executive directors who have business interests in the regions and through our network of regional agents. Now the purpose of these contacts is to help us understand the reality behind our precious monetary and economic statistics  and to help us understand what is pre-occupying you. The economic reality I would say is not at all bad. Looking back over the longer term  I detect an important change in attitudes in this country: where before people - both employers and employees - tended to look inwards and backwards  seeking to protect what they had had  now  it seems to me  they are increasingly looking outwards and forwards to new opportunities. It is a fundamental change. And over the past four years or so it has been complemented by a more stable macro-economic environment than most of us can remember in our professional life time. Putting these together has brought us consistently low inflation; steady and sustained growth; and gradually falling unemployment. And interest rates have been lower and less volatile over this period than they have been for more than thirty years. Some people  it’s true  still say to me that all this has not had much effect on them - it’s not like it was in the boom times! And I recognise  of course  that economic conditions do vary across regions and sectors and between individual companies. More than ever before it’s a tough competitive world. But what most people say to me these days is that steady growth and low inflation is exactly what they want so that they can make rational  long-term  decisions in their own businesses  which is what enables them to face the global competition. The major preoccupations that I hear are about whether our recent  more stable  economic environment will continue  and about the implications - good or bad - for that environment of a move to a single European currency. Let me say a word first about our domestic economic prospects before turning to Europe. In fact  Mr. Chairman  we set out the Bank’s views on the domestic economy at some length in our quarterly Inflation Report only last month. But in summary we have seen a gradual pick-up in the pace of activity over the past year  driven by domestic demand - notably consumer spending - so that the money supply and both demand and output are now growing at above-trend rates. Other things equal we would expect that to continue. The picture is  however  complicated by the exaggerated strengthening of sterling since last summer - particularly against the European currencies - which probably reflects uncertainties affecting the Continental countries at least as much as developments in our own economy. This strength of sterling poses  for the time being  a genuine monetary policy dilemma. It will lead to a fall in inflation in the short run - over the rest of this year - as import prices fall. And it makes life very difficult for UK manufacturers exposed to international competition  so that our external trade position is likely to deteriorate - and that may have a BIS Review 29/1997 - 2 - longer-lasting effect on inflation. But these effects may not be enough to offset the gradual emergence of inflationary pressure looking forward to next year  stemming from continuing above-trend growth of domestic demand. On that basis we advocated a moderate tightening of policy in order to slow the domestic expansion to a pace that can be sustained in the medium and longer term. Let me be quite clear  for those who insist on over-dramatising these things  we were not calling in the Inflation Report for “an immediate interest rate hike to bring an incipient boom to a juddering halt!” I should like to think that in the present more stable environment that kind of language is anachronistic. What we in fact expected over the next couple of years is continuing growth somewhat above trend with inflation picking up towards 3%  though rising - which by our own past standards is a relatively benign outlook. What we are seeking to do is to moderate the pace of expansion before inflationary pressures begin to build in order to ensure that the outlook remains benign next year  and a year after  and well into the future. And that  Mr. Chairman  is precisely what most business people - whether in industry or commerce or financial businesses - tell us they would want us to do. It is also the purpose of the Government’s Inflation Target. Let me then turn to Europe and the question of monetary union. I do not think anyone questions that economic prosperity in Europe is crucial to economic prosperity in this country. Our fundamental interests are the same. And not many people question that the effective functioning of the European single market can make a major contribution to our collective prosperity - it is a positive sum game in our mutual interest. It is clear I think too that the single market in Europe will function more effectively if each member country pursues disciplined macro-economic policies in a context of structural  supply-side  flexibility - again as a matter of national as well as collective interest. So much it seems to me is common ground in all 15 EU member countries - and indeed beyond. Whatever happens in relation to monetary union it is vital  it seems to me  that we hold on to this fundamentally important consensus. Moving on from there to the narrower question of monetary union  the potential economic benefits and risks have now become much clearer  and are rather well illustrated by our own present monetary policy dilemma. On the one hand  any manufacturer will tell you - after his experience since last summer - about the great advantage of intra-European exchange rate certainty. On the other hand  with the single currency comes the single monetary policy - the single  one-size-fits-all interest rate throughout the euro-area. The risk very simply is that the single interest rate may not in the event suit the domestic monetary policy needs of all the euromember countries - just as the present level of German interest rates of around 3%  reflecting the disappointing weakness of the German economy  would not at this point suit the UK - where  as I have said  we need to moderate the pace of our economic expansion. The potential economic risks  as well as the potential benefits  were recognised when the Maastricht Treaty was signed - and the famous “convergence criteria” were put into the Treaty precisely in order to limit the risks. Looked at from an economic perspective it would be a considerable mistake for monetary union to go ahead without reasonable confidence of genuine  sustainable  convergence between its members; and it would be a mistake for any individual country to apply to join - or to be allowed to join - unless it had achieved genuine  sustainable  convergence. But at the end of the day it is a political process - and no-one should underestimate the political determination on the Continent to proceed according to the Treaty BIS Review 29/1997 - 3 - timetable. I only hope that those who will make the decision really appreciate that if the economics of monetary union were to turn out badly - resulting in policy tension between the euro-member states - then it is unlikely to have its intended effect of advancing political harmony either. I would not at this stage care to put much money on the outcome - central bankers are a naturally cautious breed. But the prudent planning assumption is that monetary union probably will go ahead on time - at least among a limited group of countries. The question then is what would that mean for you. Let me start with the timetable. A final decision on whether to go ahead  and who should participate  will need to be taken next spring. That would open the way to the immediate setting up of the European Central Bank so that it could complete its preparations for the irrevocable fixing of exchange rates with effect from 1st January 1999. It is important to be clear what the irrevocable fixing of exchange rates means. It does not mean that the participating national currencies would instantly disappear. They would continue to exist initially as separate denominations  or sub-units  of the euro  which would have become a currency in its own right. The DM or French franc or whatever would in effect relate to the euro just as pence relate to the pound - except that the fixed conversion rate would be a great deal more complicated  extending to six significant figures! There would be no euro banknotes or coins at that stage  only book entries in euro-denominated bank accounts for those who wished to use them. No-one would be compelled to use the euro; but equally no-one would be prohibited from using it or offering euro-denominated facilities. The European Central Bank and the National Central Bank members of the European System of Central Banks would denominate their transactions in financial markets in euro  although euro-denominated amounts would be convertible into national currency denominated amounts and vice versa through the payments system for those that wished. To provide added impetus  national governments will denominate new debt issues in euros  and some at least may also convert their outstanding debt to the euro-denomination. Our working assumption is that banks and others active in the wholesale financial markets will in fact choose to transact most of their wholesale business in the euro-denomination more or less from the start. And we assume that they will wish to offer euro-denominated facilities to major business customers that wished to use them. So  for example  non-financial companies  including large retailing companies  with an active business in other euro-area countries may wish to be able to quote prices or undertake transactions in euros from an early stage  although they would certainly still need to transact most of their local business in national currencies for some considerable period. On the other hand  we would not expect there to be much demand for banking facilities denominated in euros either for individuals or for the vast majority of smaller local businesses much before euro banknotes and coins become available in late 2001 or early 2002. At that point  the conversion of retail facilities into euros might proceed quite rapidly during the subsequent six-month period when national currency notes and coin are to be withdrawn - but again the principle of no compulsion and no prohibition would apply. Retail conversion is of course a massive undertaking. But the timetable does at least provide some 4-5 years from now for people to prepare. BIS Review 29/1997 - 4 - The bottom line in all this is that if EMU goes ahead on time and whether the UK is in or out  the impact on your business will depend very much upon the nature of the business you are in. Up to now  we at the Bank have concentrated mainly on ensuring that the banking system and the wholesale financial markets will be ready to operate in euros from Day 1  because they will be affected first  and they will be affected whether or not the UK is a part of the “first wave”. But we are conscious of the developing thirst for information from the rest of the business community. With this in mind  we have co-operated with the CBI and the British Chambers of Commerce in organising regional workshops - including one to be held here in Liverpool on 23 April. We are participating too in seminars organised by the Forum of Private Business - and I am sure that if you are interested you will be able to prevail upon Stan Mendham  who I am delighted to see here this evening  to organise such a seminar here too! If you are really lucky  007 might even provide you with a short Bank of England guide: “Introduction of the Euro - what does it mean for business?” which  for reasons that I can’t quite understand  in this case comes absolutely free. The picture is rather different if the UK were to opt out of monetary union - at least for the time being. In that case the euro will be a foreign currency in the UK  and businesses  where appropriate  will need to cope with it from the 1 January 1999 just as they cope now with transactions and contracts denominated in deutschemarks  dollars  yen and the like. But the huge difference between the ‘in’ and the ‘out’ scenario will be that notes and coins would not be introduced in this country if we are an ‘out’  so that for most of us life would go on very much as normal. Mr. Chairman  I have dwelt on the practical side of monetary union very briefly this evening  because I fear that the practicalities may be overlooked in the passion of the debate about the principle. But in my youth - which seems a very long time ago now - I was a boy scout  brought up with the motto “Be Prepared”. It is vital in this context that we are indeed prepared  whatever the outcome  and the Bank is determined to do all that we can to ensure that we are. And provided we have properly prepared ourselves I do not believe that monetary union need hold great terrors for this country whichever way the decision goes when the time comes. If it is decided that EMU is a safe club for the UK to join then I think this country is as well placed as any to live with its disciplines. If on the other hand  we remain on the outside but continue to behave responsibly - in our national interest  but also as a member of the EU - then I think the fears for inward investment  or for the future of the financial services industry in this country  will prove to be exaggerated. The economic reality is that businesses - whether financial or non-financial - will expand their activities in this country so long as it is profitable for them to do so. They would be answerable to their shareholders if they behaved in any other way. The key to economic prosperity in this country  Mr. Chairman  lies in continued macro-economic discipline in a context of structural  supply-side  flexibility  and that is true regardless of monetary union. Provided - in or out - we persist in that  then we can continue to deliver a business climate of steady growth with low inflation for as far ahead as we can see. That is the best possible prospect for the bankers here this evening - and the best possible prospect for their customers. BIS Review 29/1997 - 5 - BIS Review 29/1997 - 6 - BIS Review 29/1997

Thiessen  to the Fraser Institute in Vancouver on 6/3/97.,Mr. Thiessen discusses monetary policy and the Canadian economy in a changing world Text of the Dr. Harold Walter Siebens Lecture delivered by the Governor of the Bank of Canada  Mr. Gordon G. Thiessen  to the Fraser Institute in Vancouver on 6/3/97. The performance of the Canadian economy is a popular topic these days. Canadians wonder why our economy seems to have been struggling recently  turning in a lacklustre performance that has left the unemployment rate high and a significant margin of our production capacity unused. When people focus on the recent record of the Canadian economy  they point in particular to the contrast with the United States where the economy has been operating at close to full capacity over the past couple of years. The United States is by far our most important trading partner. And in the past  economic developments in Canada have tended to follow reasonably closely those in the United States. Naturally  people want to know what is different this time. The fact that the Canadian economy has not been expanding at a strong pace is also worrying to governments trying  as they are  to address budgetary problems. They are concerned that fiscal cutbacks may weaken the economy further. Of course in all of this  questions are also raised about the role of monetary policy. I would like to take this opportunity today to discuss the factors that have affected the recent performance of the Canadian economy  to explain the role that monetary policy has played  and to conclude with some comments on our future economic prospects. The Canadian economy in a changing world environment The world economy has been going through profound changes. Many developing countries have embraced open markets and international trade as a means of accelerating their economic progress. Deregulation and privatization initiatives have been undertaken by both developing and industrial countries  typically as part of structural adjustment programs to improve economic performance. Technological changes have reduced the cost of capital relative to labour  encouraging businesses to use more physical capital  in particular more computers and computer-based equipment. And there has been an accompanying shift in the demand for labour away from unskilled workers. These technological innovations  along with reductions in transportation and communications costs  have also made possible a wider geographic dispersion of the production process -- not just nationally but internationally. And to ensure access to foreign markets  countries have been pursuing multilateral and regional trading arrangements. As a result  all nations have been adjusting to the new reality of heightened international competition and to the accompanying substantial shifts in the location of production of many goods. Such shifts have not been limited merely to the diversion of the production of goods requiring unsophisticated techniques to the developing countries. Indeed  some developing nations  particularly in Asia  are establishing themselves as important suppliers of a wide range of internationally traded products  including high-technology manufactured goods. At the same time  industrial economies are moving more towards the export of services  as a result of improvements in communications and information technology. BIS Review 29/1997 - 2 - All in all  these changes are to the good  in that they should result in expanding international trade  more rapid increases in productivity and  hence  improved living standards everywhere  but especially in developing countries. However  these ongoing globalization trends and adjustments to new technology do imply changes in the structure of national economies. Canada and other industrial countries are having to cope with these changes. But change is never easy and is often stressful. Even in the large U.S. economy  there has been considerable concern over the uncertain job prospects  especially for unskilled workers  in light of the changes in technology  production and trade trends that I have just described. However  the process of adjustment in the United States to these developments began early  and their economy has been operating successfully at full capacity. Why is it that in Canada we seem to have had a more difficult time of it? There are a number of reasons for this. But  in my view  one of the most important is the fact that in Canada we started adjusting later and  as a result  we were further behind. Why was that? The depreciation of the Canadian dollar in the mid-1980s  by easing the pressure from foreign competition  blunted the urgency to adopt more efficient production processes. And through much of the second half of the 1980s  because many Canadians were still acting on expectations of accelerating inflation  we were devoting a good part of our energies and resources to speculative activities  rather than investing in improvements in productivity and competitiveness. Rising government deficits  which were absorbing increasing amounts of domestic savings  were not helping either. Thus  with poor productivity growth  rapidly rising wages and generally weak cost control  Canadian businesses and exporters found it increasingly difficult to compete  especially at the end of the 1980s  when the Canadian dollar had reversed its earlier depreciation. For a nation that is highly dependent on foreign trade  Canada certainly was doing all the wrong things to get ready for the new world of changing technology and increasing global competition. It was not until the early 1990s that many Canadian businesses realized that they had to undertake major adjustments. They had to restructure  invest in new technology and implement tight cost control. And they had to do it quickly if they were going to position themselves to take advantage of the Free Trade Agreement with the United States  the subsequent North American Free Trade Agreement and then  more generally  the multilateral agreement on trade liberalization. Adjustments of this magnitude are never easy. They are often disruptive and stressful  generating a great deal of uncertainty about the future for both individuals and businesses. But because the adjustment process was delayed in Canada  it ended up being more far-ranging and more intense than in the United States. For many businesses  restructuring has meant downsizing. But the business sector has not been the only area of the Canadian economy in need of an overhaul. There has also been an urgent need for fiscal adjustment. Here again  that adjustment was late in coming. As a result  the cutbacks and downsizing necessary to restore fiscal health have been more sweeping and more disruptive than if action has been taken much earlier. Thus  we have had two major structural adjustments vital to our economy taking place back to back. Indeed  over the past year  these adjustments have been overlapping  and that may continue for some time. And while a good deal of the restructuring in the private sector has BIS Review 29/1997 - 3 - already occurred  the adjustment in the public sector still has some way to go. This restructuring has affected the unemployment rate as more people move between jobs  taking time to retrain and upgrade their skills. And the related uncertainty among workers has been reflected in low consumer confidence and an unwillingness to spend. As a result  the recovery of the Canadian economy has been slower than it might otherwise have been. However  what we must not forget is that restructuring in both the private and public sectors was absolutely necessary  and it will have significant payoffs for the Canadian economy in terms of productivity gains  competitiveness and an improved standard of living. The role of monetary policy What has been the role of monetary policy in all of these developments? Should monetary policy have been following a different course to ease some of the difficulties that our economy has encountered? During the last half of the 1980s  monetary policy sought to prevent excessive demand pressures from fuelling an accelerating trend of inflation. The intention was to put inflation on a gradual downward trend once the demand pressures subsided. In February 1991  the Bank of Canada and the federal government made a formal commitment to price stability as the objective of monetary policy. To make the path to price stability more explicit  the Bank and the government agreed on specific targets for inflation control. The targets aimed at bringing inflation (as measured by the consumer price index) down from about 5 per cent at the end of 1990 to 2 per cent by the end of 1995. indeed was aiming Inflation decelerated sharply between 1991 and 1992 -- much more than the Bank had anticipated or the sharper-than-expected downturn of the Canadian economy in 1990-1991 and the subsequent slow recovery. Our economy had to cope with both the economic distortions caused by past high inflation and with the large and overdue adjustment needed to respond to the changes in technology and the more open and competitive world markets that I have been describing. for. This was mainly result of the When I reflect on the view expressed by the Bank’s critics that the 1990-1991 recession  the slow recovery and the sharp deterioration in our fiscal situation were all caused by an excessively tight monetary policy in the late 1980s  I find it useful to ask what would have happened if monetary policy had in fact been less anti-inflationary in the late 1980s. I believe that such a policy would have led to even greater inflation-related distortions in our economy  an even more pronounced recession afterwards and still greater problems for businesses trying to adjust to the new technology and the more competitive international environment. Moreover  higher inflation would have led to higher interest rates and more expensive debt-servicing costs for governments and other debtors. Indeed  with the benefit of hindsight  if there is a lesson in this experience  it is that the Bank should have pursued a tighter monetary policy earlier in the second half of the 1980s. A tighter monetary policy earlier on might have moderated some of the speculative activity and debt accumulation that subsequently weighed so heavily on our economy. The other lesson is that fiscal policy  too  should have been tighter during that period. With a tighter fiscal policy  some of the buildup of public debt that governments are now having to contend with would have been avoided. More fiscal restraint during the second half of BIS Review 29/1997 - 4 - the 1980s would also have moderated the excess spending demands on the economy  removing some of the upward pressure on interest rates and the Canadian dollar at the time. Since the sharp deceleration of inflation in 1992  the role of monetary policy has been to keep inflation low. In doing so  monetary policy has provided Canadian businesses with a more stable  lower interest rate environment in which to undertake the investments and cost controls necessary to adjust to the new competitive reality I have described. Looking to the future So  where is the Canadian economy now  and what are the prospects for the future? I believe that Canadian business has gone through a remarkable transformation in the last few years. There has been substantial investment in machinery and equipment  particularly in computer-based technology  to improve productivity. And strict cost control is now the norm. As a result  Canadian businesses have become much more competitive  both at home and internationally. The low Canadian dollar has  no doubt  also been helpful in this respect. But businesses are using the low exchange rate to help them get into new world markets and expand their market share rather than needing it to offset uncontrolled costs and poor productivity. The benefits from this restructuring can already be seen in the success that Canadian businesses have had over the last few years in exporting their products and in competing with imports within Canada. Indeed  exports are likely to remain the main locomotive for economic expansion in the period ahead. The restructuring process for the public sector is not that far advanced as yet. As I noted earlier  most governments in Canada took major steps last year to reduce their fiscal deficits. However  public debt levels remain high in relation to our total national income. Evidence of investor concerns about these debt levels  and about political uncertainty  can be seen in the persistence in Canada of medium and longer-term interest rates that are high relative to similar rates in the United States. These high interest rates have the potential to discourage some of the investments that will be needed to keep the Canadian economy productive and competitive in the future. In order to reduce these interest rates  Canadian governments must stay the course of fiscal consolidation  and bring down the levels of public debt in relation to national income. The largest part of economic activity in our country revolves around the spending by Canadian households on consumer goods of all kinds and on housing. This has been the area most affected by the stresses and uncertainty of the restructuring. As I said before  a good deal of the restructuring in the private sector has already occurred. And private sector jobs have been increasing -- by 3.5 per cent in 1994 and 1.5 per cent in 1995. We now need to reduce some of the anxiety associated with public sector restructuring by getting on as quickly as possible with the fundamental decisions needed to put government programs and their funding on a sustainable basis. As for monetary policy  our good inflation performance and the fiscal measures taken so far have given the Bank of Canada some room to ease monetary conditions in Canada. I BIS Review 29/1997 - 5 - believe there is now substantial monetary stimulus in the economy  which should help counteract some of the concerns that affect the confidence of Canadians  as we work our way through this crucial period of restructuring the Canadian economy.

I The Boersen Executive Club has asked me to speak about “Economic Convergence and EMU”. I shall be pleased to do so  especially as I can well imagine that you here in Denmark are able to adopt a somewhat more relaxed and calmer approach to the subject of “Convergence and EMU”. There are two obvious reasons for that. Firstly  Denmark itself has made distinct progress in economic convergence during the past few years. That progress was documented in the European Monetary Institute’s recently published Convergence Report. The Danish krone has been stable internally for a good number of years. It is unlikely that Denmark will have any problem with the exchange rate criterion either. Happily  participation in the ERM - as in Germany - has never been at issue here. And there has been notable progress in consolidating public finance. The assessment of Denmark in the European Monetary Institute’s Convergence Report was therefore decidedly more positive than that of Germany. The second reason why you in Denmark can be rather more relaxed on the subject of “Convergence and EMU” is  of course  self-evident. Denmark has announced that  for the time being  it is not going to participate in the third stage of monetary union. Naturally  we in Germany respect Denmark’s sovereign decision  even if we at the Bundesbank are not unreservedly happy about that decision. That is because it is precisely in the initial phase that we shall need stable partners in EMU. But the door is open. The terms of entry are known on all sides. What has not happened yet can  of course  take place at some point in the future. It goes without saying  however  that this is a matter for the Danes themselves to decide. Whatever decision Denmark ultimately takes on participating in the third stage  I hope that exchange rate stability is maintained as before. It is likely that the Danish krone will belong at least to the exchange rate mechanism of “EMS II” from the outset. That would  at any rate  imply the existence of close bilateral links between the Danish krone and the euro. For the rest  it is precisely the economic and stability record of countries not wishing to belong from the outset which represents a challenge to and a commitment for the euro area. In this way  Denmark can play a part  at least indirectly  in the anti-inflationary orientation of the euro  even if it does not join EMU at once. Naturally enough  the setting-up of an “EMS II” will  at the same time  enhance the responsibility of the European Central Bank. A stable euro is an essential precondition for the operation of an intra-European exchange rate system. I am convinced that the European Central Bank will be fully aware of precisely that international responsibility for the euro as the anchor currency. BIS Review 30/1997 - 2 - Central Bank: There will also be other links between the Danish central bank and the European The Governor of Danmarks Nationalbank will be a member of the enlarged Governing Council of the ECB. And the central banks of the countries with a derogation are also invited to participate in TARGET  the planned large-value payment system for the euro. In saying that  I would ask you to understand why there has to be a minimum of divergence in the terms of participation in TARGET. Those terms have to take account of the differing commitments of the central banks inside and outside the euro area. II In order to explain the relationship between economic convergence and EMU  there is  in the first place  a fairly simple textbook answer. By definition  a monetary union abolishes  once and for all  the instrument of exchange rate adjustment between the participating economies. The countries taking part must be able to do without that instrument for ever - even if structural changes occur. That calls for the ability on the part of each participant to keep up with the others in terms of economic and anti-inflationary performance  or - if it does fall behind - the ability to remedy a worsening of its competitive position by its own domestic efforts. These general requirements of a single currency area apply to the euro to a quite special degree. There are three reasons for this: Firstly  in the supranational euro area - in contrast to the usual national environment of a currency - there will be hardly any fiscal policy mechanisms that would be able to counterbalance regional disequilibria. There will not be a dominant central budget. At the Community level  there will be no network comparable to an internal  national system of income redistribution. The public financial systems and social security will remain in the national domain. Secondly  any regional disequilibria in the euro area would scarcely be mitigated by high labour mobility. Linguistic and cultural barriers will continue to exist. Furthermore  high labour mobility within Europe might even provoke opposition. In Germany  we have witnessed something of that kind in the construction industry  owing to the fact that it depresses wages. And thirdly  the increased need for internal flexibility resulting from the irrevocably fixed exchange rates must be seen against the backdrop of current economic conditions in Europe. Most countries in Europe are faced with an enormous need for adjustment anyway as a result of the fiercer competition in the single market and in a global economy and as a result of a number of domestic problems which are probably home-grown: on the labour market  in public finance  in provision for old age. The setting prefigured for the next decade is therefore a highly dynamic one. That will  of course  not make it easier for any country to perform the task of holding its own economically in a monetary union. Bearing that in mind  it will be extremely important for the euro area to restrict entry to those countries which are ready in terms of their economic and anti-inflation policies. BIS Review 30/1997 - 3 - That is to prevent a lack of anti-inflationary convergence from being transformed into real economic divergence. Any split in real economic trends would  naturally  exert pressure in the direction of a transfer and social union  or even of a European “super-state”  which you in Denmark - if I understand it correctly - do not want  and which we in Germany - I can assure you - do not want either. Adequate and lasting convergence is in the individual countries’ own interests  however. That is because a country which is unable durably to pursue the same course as the others in the euro area will itself get into difficulties - all the more so if the other countries are not prepared to enter into a permanent burden-sharing arrangement  with all its attendant political implications. III Besides that textbook answer to the question of the relationship between convergence and EMU  there is another aspect. What a monetary union needs is not just convergence in terms of the hard economic data. It also needs a convergence in terms of thinking. That implies convergence in objectives and in how we interpret and explain the interaction of economic forces. Monetary union will not just abolish the exchange rate instrument domestically. It will of necessity also call for a single domestic and external monetary policy  and thus a common stance in a key policy area. For the euro area  however  achieving and maintaining a common stance of this kind will undoubtedly be more difficult than for a traditional national currency area. Whereas the currency will be supranational  it will generally remain the individual governments that will be taking the decisions on economic and social policy. That is all the more reason why the euro needs dominant patterns of preference which are common to all participants. That likewise implies the affirmation of major fundamental positions. Firstly  maintaining the value of money is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to economic growth and employment. Price stability is the foundation on which society and policy-makers can and must carry out the necessary adjustments. Secondly  in the event of conflict  internal price stability must have priority over external exchange rate stability. Thirdly  experience has shown that a central bank which is independent of the vagaries of day- to-day politics  and committed solely to the goal of price stability  helps to safeguard that indispensable price stability. By the way  that might be even more important in a supranational union than in a purely national context. These three basic convictions are essential to a durably stable currency. That is why they have rightly been enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty. Article 107 lays down the European Central Bank’s independence of instructions. The Statute of the European Central Bank requires it “to maintain price stability” as its primary objective. And Article 109 (1) and (2) require the EU Council to pursue external exchange-rate policy without prejudice to the objective of maintaining price stability. Any calls for the political control of the European Central Bank or for different objectives were thus firmly rejected five years ago  when the Treaty was signed. BIS Review 30/1997 - 4 - But it is  of course  not only the legal position created by the Maastricht Treaty which argues in favour of the primacy of price stability and its safeguarding by means of independent monetary policy. Past experience and economic reason argue in its favour  too. It is important that this is perceived - and lastingly perceived - to be the case in all the participating countries. Otherwise  political conflicts might impose a heavy burden on monetary union at a later date. The task of preserving a durably stable currency is  however  one which has to be faced in other policy areas  too. It cannot be a matter for the monetary policy of the European Central Bank alone - particularly since the ECB still has to establish its reputation and credibility in the first place. However great a contribution an independent central bank can make to a stable currency  monetary policy is never conducted in a political vacuum or under laboratory conditions. And  in the long run  a currency’s fate can never be divorced from the political and economic trends in the area in which it is used. That is why there is yet another item on the list of common features needed for a durably stable monetary union. The Euro requires  fourthly  a sense of and a willingness for shared responsibility for the currency in all the participating countries and in the various policy areas. That applies to wage rate policy  for example. Above all  however  it applies to fiscal policy. It is the resolute and lasting pursuit of sound policies that will be of crucial importance in that respect - and not any one-off measures. An effective stability pact is extremely important  too  for the same reason - a stability pact being  incidentally  precisely in the interests of the smaller countries. After all  any undisciplined behaviour on the part of a large partner country of substantial economic weight could have a severe adverse impact on interest rates and on confidence in long-term stability  thus hampering the economic growth of its partners. The pact on stability and growth agreed in Dublin is an important reminder and assertion of the need for that shared responsibility. Its details are to be set down in legal texts during the next few weeks. What will be absolutely crucial at this juncture is for the requirements laid down in Dublin to be spelled out in precise terms. Failing this  there might easily be unnecessary conflict later on. And  of course  at a later date it will be necessary to apply those provisions consistently if excessive budget deficits are incurred. IV EMU being able to build on sufficient convergence in economic performance as well as on sufficient convergence in the thinking of all the participating countries  would undoubtedly open up major opportunities for Europe. The economic advantages are obvious: Exchange costs will cease to exist in trade within the euro area. Exchange rates against the US dollar and the yen could become more stable. The financial markets could expand and intensify  to the benefit of creditors and debtors. But  above all - and this is the key factor - overall competition will increase. A stable common currency will give the single market a new dimension. Admittedly  that does not by any means imply that the euro will solve the structural problems besetting a large number of European countries at present or in future. On the contrary  the pressure to adjust deriving from the single market and from globalisation will  if anything  tend to grow stronger rather than weaker. BIS Review 30/1997 - 5 - Incidentally  the increasing competitive pressure by no means implies that all countries have to pursue the same economic and social policies. Under the conditions obtaining now and in the future  policy-makers will  in fact  have different options available to them to satisfy their own preferences. But there is one precept that holds true for everyone  whether they like it or not. Whatever policy a country may pursue  the economy must be viable  and compete  in an international setting on a durable basis. One gains the impression that  at the moment  the smaller countries in continental Europe are having slightly less difficulty in adapting to changed competitive conditions. Perhaps that is because it has always been more necessary for smaller countries to be flexible and prove themselves in foreign markets. Obviously  it is a case of “small is beautiful”. At any rate  both the Netherlands and Denmark appear to be already a little way ahead of the larger countries on the continent. Hence Germany is looking here towards Denmark with growing interest. The German press reports on the “job miracle in the north” - especially as the fall in unemployment and resilient growth is being accompanied by a marked course of consolidation in public finance. Last autumn  for example  the present Governor of the Dutch central bank and future President of the European Monetary Institute  Wim Duisenberg  was in a position to say: “I do not believe that there is a contradiction between fiscal consolidation and creation of employment and economic growth. Evidence from ... Denmark supports my view. In Denmark  the general government’s net borrowing will be reduced to almost a balanced budget in 1997  while the unemployment rate is expected to decline to almost 9 % of the working population  compared with the all-time high of more than 12 % in 1994.” Admittedly  public finance is precisely the area in which Denmark has to be ambitious. The provisional “no” to entry into the third stage of monetary union may be playing a certain role in the international financial markets. At least  that was how the OECD saw it in its 1996 Economic Survey: “... the increase in Danish risk premiums seems high compared with other ERM members. Since the main feature that separates Denmark from those countries is the discussion not to participate in stage III of ERM.” Denmark can now point to a positive interrelationship between higher employment and sound public finance. In that respect  Denmark is a model for us in Germany. Our country is at present in the process of rethinking  and facing up to these difficult challenges. That is not a simple matter  especially as the structural inflexibilities existing in Germany have arisen over a long period. Our own adjustments are all the more important  seeing that we shall have to cope with the economic implications of German reunification for some considerable time to come. It is my hope and wish that we shall soon be able to make the progress that is needed  and achieve positive results. That will undoubtedly be the case if we follow the path taken by our neighbours in the north and north-west. At all events  the Netherlands and Denmark are setting important signposts  not only for us in Germany  but also for the road to EMU and beyond. BIS Review 30/1997

Stals  at a Business Breakfast Forum hosted by Marriott Merchant Bank and Deloitte & Touche in Durban on 17/3/97.,Dr. Stals assesses the new opportunities for South African investors in an environment of no exchange controls Address by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank  Dr. C. Stals  at a Business Breakfast Forum hosted by Marriott Merchant Bank and Deloitte & Touche in Durban on 17/3/97. 1. Background The announcement on the further relaxation of exchange controls by the Minister of Finance  Mr. Trevor Manuel  on Wednesday last week received as much  if not more  attention as his announcements on fiscal policy for the 1997/98 fiscal year. For more than 35 years  South African residents were not permitted  at least within the rules of the law  to make investments outside of the country without prior approval from the exchange control authorities. Approval was seldom given  particularly not before 1994 when the besieged South African economy had to contend with international sanctions  boycotts and disinvestment campaigns. Following upon the political and social reforms in the country and the withdrawal of punitive international economic actions  the Reserve Bank and the Department of Finance started with a gradual phasing out of the exchange controls. A major constraint remained an acute shortage of foreign exchange reserves which were completely depleted by the time the Government of National Unity came into power in April 1994. Looking back over the past three years  good progress has nevertheless been made with the gradual phasing-out of the exchange controls. As a first priority  all restrictions on non-residents to repatriate their investment funds from South Africa were removed. Various ways and means were introduced to enable South African corporates to acquire foreign investments in branches or subsidiaries controlled by them. They were  for example  allowed to use the proceeds of foreign equity or convertible debenture issues to finance foreign investments. The Reserve Bank has approved a cumulative amount of more than R18 billion for this purpose. In June 1995  a scheme was introduced to enable South African insurers and pension and mutual funds to diversify part of their existing asset portfolios into foreign currency denominated investments. Approval has been given for more than R30 billion of asset swap transactions in terms of which institutional investors could exchange South African assets for foreign assets in this process. According to information available to the Reserve Bank  more than R17 billion of these transactions have been executed. A number of internal arrangements were introduced to reduce the administrative burden of exchange controls  for example to grant the authorised dealers in foreign exchange more scope for discretionary decisions on exchange control applications  without prior reference to the Reserve Bank. In the process  virtually all exchange controls on current account transactions in the balance of payments (i.e. payments for goods and services) were removed. The announcement made by the Minister of Finance last week extended the exchange control relaxation programme now also to foreign investments by private individuals. A basis has been established for a continuation of the gradual removal of the exchange controls through the periodic lifting of limits and other administrative measures over a wide front to cover the corporate sector  institutional investors and private individuals. There remains but the BIS Review 30/1997 - 2 - blocked assets of emigrants (former South African residents) that need to be addressed at some stage. 2. The relaxations announced last week The announcement of some further exchange control relaxations last week by the Minister of Finance was very important  not only for the substance of the relaxations but also for the clear policy direction indicated. This was the first major relaxation of the exchange controls announced by Mr Manuel since he became Minister of Finance in April 1996 and confirmed his endorsement of the policy of the gradual removal of the exchange controls. Secondly  the Minister himself regarded the announced relaxations as an important change in the underlying philosophy held by the Government on exchange controls. In his Budget Speech the Minister said: “The package of exchange control reforms placed before this House today moves South Africa to a system with a positive rather than a negative bias ....... The objective is to reach a point where there is equality of treatment between non-residents and residents in relation to inflows and outflows of capital.” The Minister  in other words wants to indicate that South Africa now has a free foreign exchange system with a number of temporary exceptions  instead of a controlled system with a few special concessions. The wide-ranging concessions now made give South African corporates more freedom to make direct investments outside of South Africa  with some special dispensation for investments in other members of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC); increase the scope for institutional investors to diversify part of their portfolios into foreign assets and for the first time enable South African private individuals to make foreign investments  either directly or through South African authorised dealers in foreign exchange. Some of the details of these relaxations must still be worked out  but the Minister indicated that all the relaxations announced will be implemented by 1 July 1997. 3. New options for the investor In the past  many South Africans wanted to invest part of their savings outside of the country for non-financial reasons  and this may still be so in future. The more rational investor  however  may think twice before making an investment in a foreign currency  in a foreign country and perhaps also in the shares of a foreign company. In considering such a possibility  a few important macroeconomic realities will have to be taken into account. The first is that markets  the more free they become and the more efficient they function  also work more effectively as a catalyst for equalisation. For example  if the average rate of inflation in South Africa over time is 10 per cent per annum and the average rate of inflation in the rest of the world is 3 per cent  nominal interest rates in South Africa will on average be about 7 per cent above the level of nominal interest rates in other countries. Differences in real rates of interest will reflect differences in the risk factor attached to investment in different countries. In the same example  the exchange rate of the South African rand will depreciate over time by about 7 per cent per annum. The depreciation in the exchange rate will therefore BIS Review 30/1997 - 3 - make sure that the converted rand value of a foreign investment will keep up with the value of a similar South African investment  adjusted for inflation. There are therefore no special gains to be made from the investment in a foreign currency. Thirdly  taxation in South Africa will be levied on income earned on foreign investments on the same basis as income earned in South Africa. (The taxation on “passive income” earned in foreign countries as referred to by the Minister in his Budget Speech.) Foreign investments will  however  hold new risk exposures for South African investors  particularly in an environment of volatile international exchange rates. The timing of the transfer of an investment into a foreign currency can be detrimental. A South African investor who may have transferred his savings into a sterling investment earlier this year when the exchange rate between the rand and the pound was R8.00 = £1.00 could have lost 10 per cent of his investment within a very short period of time. Last Friday the exchange rate was back to R7.10 = £1.00. This brings into any foreign investment a new speculative element that does not exist in the local investment market. Finally  very few private individuals in South Africa have the knowledge and the expertise to manage foreign investment portfolios  and to assess the alien risk exposures that are connected to such investments. We should not  just because of sentimental reasons  make use of a new freedom to invest funds abroad when a local investment will serve our needs better and more effectively. 4. Monetary policy in an environment of no exchange controls The new situation brings new challenges also for monetary policy. The depreciation of the rand last year  and the appreciation of almost 10 per cent since November 1996  gave us a taste of the new exposures of our financial system to the global markets. If South Africa wants to be part of the global village  we shall have to abide by the rules of the international markets. Without exchange controls  capital in and outflows will be dictated by market forces  and markets are inclined to put heavy penalties on errors made by governments and central banks in their macroeconomic policy decisions. It will be fatal for a country to liberalise its financial systems and to encourage the integration of its domestic financial markets into the global system  and then to balk at the disciplines of these markets. 5. Financial institutions without exchange controls Many South African financial institutions have already taken up the challenge of becoming part of the international financial community. Such institutions will also have to consider carefully how this new venture will affect their own security  liquidity and solvability. There are numerous examples in the world of the collapse and failure of major financial institutions because of international exposure. Governments or financial regulators and supervisors cannot protect multinational institutions against the many risks involved in being global. South African institutions were protected from these international risk exposures through the isolation of our country from the BIS Review 30/1997 - 4 - international markets. Now that the opportunities are being opened up for an outward movement  they have to tread with care and with caution. 6. Conclusion The removal of exchange controls opens up new opportunities for South African corporates  institutional investors and private individuals. All of them  however  must not be overwhelmed by emotional considerations inspired by a new freedom  but must give careful consideration before any decision is taken to invest hard earned savings in a foreign country  in a foreign currency and in a foreign institution.

Mr. Chairman  members of the Subcommittee  thank you for inviting me to present the views of the Federal Reserve Board on the supervision of our nation’s banking organizations should they be authorized by the Congress to engage in a wider range of activities. As you know  the Board has supported financial modernization for many years and hopes that the Congress will act to facilitate reforms that  by enhancing competition within the financial services industry  would benefit the consumers of financial products in the United States. Financial modernization may well mean that future banking organizations will be sufficiently different from today as to require perhaps substantial changes in the supervisory process for the entire organization. Just how much modification may be needed will depend on the kinds of reforms the Congress adopts. In evaluating those modifications  I would like to underline the significant supervisory role required by the Federal Reserve to carry out its central bank responsibilities. I also would like briefly to discuss the continued importance of umbrella supervision and the implications of a wider role for bank subsidiaries in the modernization process. Supervision and Central Banking There are compelling reasons why the central bank of the United States -- the Federal Reserve -- should continue to be involved in the supervision of banks. The supervisory activities of the Federal Reserve  for example  have benefited from its economic stabilization responsibilities and its recognition that safety and soundness goals for banks must be evaluated jointly with its responsibilities for the stability and growth of the economy. The Board believes that these joint responsibilities make for better supervisory and monetary policies than would result from either a supervisor divorced from economic responsibilities or a macroeconomic policymaker with no practical experience in the review of individual bank operations. To carry out its responsibilities  the Federal Reserve has been required to develop extensive  detailed knowledge of the intricacies of the U.S.  and indeed the world  financial system. That expertise is the result of dealing constantly over many decades with changing financial markets and institutions and their relationships with each other and with the economy  and from exercising supervisory responsibilities. It comes as well from ongoing interactions with central banks and financial institutions abroad. These international contacts are critical because today crises can spread more rapidly than in earlier times -- in large part reflecting new technologies -- and require a coordinated international response. Crisis Management and Systemic Risk to Second only its macrostability responsibilities the central bank’s responsibility to use its authority and expertise to forestall financial crises (including systemic disturbances in the banking system) and to manage such crises once they occur. In a crisis  the Federal Reserve  to be sure  could always flood the market with liquidity through open market operations and discount window loans; at times it has stood ready to do so  and it does not need supervisory and regulatory responsibilities to exercise that power. But while sometimes is BIS Review 31/1997 necessary in times of crises  such an approach may be costly and distortive to economic incentives and long-term growth  as well as an insufficient remedy. Supervisory and regulatory responsibilities give the Federal Reserve both the insight and the authority to use techniques that are less blunt and more precisely calibrated to the problem at hand. Such tools improve our ability to manage crises and  more importantly  to avoid them. The use of such techniques requires both the authority that comes with supervision and regulation and the understanding of the linkages among supervision and regulation  prudential standards  risk taking  relationships among banks and other financial market participants  and macroeconomic stability. Our financial system -- market oriented and characterized by innovation and rapid change -- imparts significant benefits to our economy. But one of the consequences of such a dynamic system is that it is subject to episodes of stress. In the 1980s and early 1990s we faced a series of international debt crises  a major stock market crash  the collapse of the most important player in the junk bond market  the virtual failure of the S&L industry  and extensive losses at many banking institutions. More recently  we faced another Mexican crisis and  while in the event less disruptive  the failure of a large British merchant bank. In such situations the Federal Reserve stands ready to provide liquidity  if necessary  and monitors continuously the condition of depository institutions to contain the secondary consequences of any problem. The objectives of the central bank in crisis management are to contain financial losses and prevent a contagious loss of confidence so that difficulties at one institution do not spread more widely to others. The focus of its concern is not to avoid the failure of entities that have made poor decisions or have had bad luck  but rather to see that such failures -- or threats of failures -- do not have broad and serious impacts on financial markets and the national  and indeed the global  economy. The Federal Reserve’s ability to respond expeditiously to any particular incident does not necessitate comprehensive information on each banking institution. But it does require that the Federal Reserve have in-depth knowledge of how institutions of various sizes and other characteristics are likely to behave  and what resources are available to them in the event of severe financial stress. Even for those events that might  but do not  precipitate financial crises  the authorities turn first to the Federal Reserve  not only because  as former Chairman Volcker noted last month  we have the money  but also because we have the expertise and the experience. We currently gain the necessary insight by having a broad sample of banks subject to our supervision and through our authority over bank holding companies. Payment and Settlement Systems Virtually all of the U.S. dollar transactions made worldwide -- for securities transfers  foreign exchange and other international capital flows  and for payment for goods and services -- are settled in the United States banking system. A small number of transactions that comprise the vast proportion of the total value of transactions are transferred over large-dollar payment systems. Banks use two of these systems -- Fedwire  operated by the Federal Reserve  and CHIPS  operated by the New York Clearing House -- currently to transfer $1.6 trillion and $1.3 trillion a day  respectively. CHIPS settles its members’ net positions on Fedwire. These interbank transfers  for banks’ own accounts and for those of their customers  occur and are settled over a network and structure that is the backbone of the U.S. financial system. Indeed  it is arguably the linchpin of the international system of payments that relies on the dollar as the major international currency for trade and finance. Disruptions and disturbances in the U.S. payment system thus can easily have global implications. Fedwire  CHIPS  and the specialized depositories and clearinghouses for securities and other financial instruments  are crucial to the integrity and stability not only of our financial markets and BIS Review 31/1997 - 3 - economy  but those of the world. Similarly  adverse developments in transfers in London  Tokyo  Singapore  and a host of other centers could rapidly be transferred here  given the financial interrelationships among the individual trading nations. In all these payment and settlement systems  commercial banks play a central role  both as participants and providers of credit to nonbank participants. Day-in and day-out  the settlement of payment obligations and securities trades requires significant amounts of bank credit. In periods of stress  such credit demands surge just at the time when some banks are least willing or able to meet them. These demands  if unmet  could produce gridlock in payment and settlement systems  halting activity in financial markets. Indeed  it is in the cauldron of the payments and settlement systems  where decisions involving large sums must be made quickly  that all of the risks and uncertainties associated with problems at a single participant become focussed as participants seek to protect themselves from uncertainty. Better solvent than sorry  they might well decide  and refuse to honor a payment request. Observing that  others might follow suit. And that is how crises often begin. Limiting  if not avoiding  such disruptions and ensuring the continued operation of the payment system requires broad and indepth knowledge of banking and markets  as well as detailed knowledge and authority with respect to the payment and settlement arrangements and their linkages to banking operations. This type of understanding and authority -- as well as knowledge about the behavior of key participants -- cannot be created on an ad hoc basis. It requires broad and sustained involvement in both the payment infrastructure and the operation of the banking system. Supervisory authority over the major bank participants is a necessary element. Monetary Policy While financial crises and payment systems disruptions arise only sporadically  the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy on an ongoing basis. In this area  too  the Federal Reserve’s role in supervision and regulation provides an important perspective to the policy process. Monetary policy works through financial institutions and markets to affect the economy  and depository institutions are a key element in those markets. Indeed  banks and thrifts are more important in this regard than might be suggested by a simple arithmetic calculation of their share of total credit flows. While diverse securities markets handle the lion’s share of credit flows these days  banks are the backup source of liquidity to many of the securities firms and large borrowers participating in these markets. Moreover  banks at all times are the most important source of credit to most small and intermediate-sized firms that do not have ready access to securities markets. These firms are the catalyst for U.S. economic growth and the prime source of new employment opportunities for our citizens. The Federal Reserve must make its monetary policy with a view to how banks are responding to the economic environment. This was especially important during the “credit crunch” of 1990. Our supervisory responsibilities give us important qualitative and quantitative information that not only helps us in the design of monetary policy  but provides important feedback on how our policy stance is affecting bank actions. The macroeconomic stabilization responsibilities of the Federal Reserve make us particularly sensitive to how regulatory and supervisory postures can influence bank behavior and hence how banks respond to monetary policy actions. For example  capital  liquidity  loan loss reserve  and asset quality evaluation policies of supervisors will directly influence the manner and speed with which monetary policy actions work. In the development of interagency rules and policies  the Federal Reserve brings to the table its unique concerns about the impact of BIS Review 31/1997 these rules on credit availability  potential responses to changes in interest rates  and the consequences for the economy. We believe that  as a result  supervisory policy is improved. Federal Reserve’s Supervisory Role For all of these reasons  the Board believes the Federal Reserve needs to retain a significant supervisory role in the banking system. Just exactly how that is achieved depends critically on the types of reforms the Congress enacts and the direction the banking industry takes in structuring and conducting its activities. In the Board’s view  its current authority is adequate for the current structure. For today’s financial system  we are able to meet our obligations by the intelligence we gain from  and the authorities we have over the modest number of large banks we directly supervise and the holding companies of these and other large banks over which we have a direct umbrella supervisory role. Our information is importantly supplemented by our supervision of a number of other banks of all sizes  namely state member banks. Currently  the latter group gives us a good representative sample of organizations of all sizes outside the largest entities. The large entities are essential if we are to address the Federal Reserve’s crisis management and systemic risk responsibilities  deal with international financial issues involving foreign central banks  manage risk exposures in payment systems  and retain our practical knowledge and skill base in rapidly changing financial markets. Large bank holding companies are typically at the forefront in financial innovation and in developing sophisticated techniques for managing risks. It is crucial that the Federal Reserve stay informed of these events and understand directly how they work in practice. Directly supervising both these large organizations and a sample of others is also critical to our ability to conduct monetary policy by permitting us to gain first-hand on-the-spot intelligence on how changes in financial markets -- including those induced by monetary policy -- are affecting money and credit flows. If in the future the holding company becomes a less clear window into the banking system  the Board believes that the Congress would need to change the supervisory structure if the central bank is to carry out the responsibilities I have discussed today. Umbrella Supervision The Congress  in its review of financial modernization  must consider legal entity supervision alone versus legal entity supervision supplemented by umbrella supervision. The Board believes that umbrella supervision is a realistic necessity for the protection of our financial system and to limit any misuse of the sovereign credit  that is  the government’s guarantees that support the banking system through the safety net. The bank holding company organization increasingly is being managed so as to take advantage of the synergies between its component parts in order to deliver better products to the market and higher returns to stockholders. Such synergies cannot occur if the model of the holding company is one in which the parent is just  in effect  a portfolio investor in its subsidiary. Indeed  virtually all of the large holding companies now operate as integrated units and are managed as such  especially in their management of risk. One could argue that regulators should be interested only in the entities they regulate and  hence  review the risk evaluation process only as it relates to their regulated entity. Presumably each regulator of each entity -- the bank regulators  the SEC  the state insurance and any state finance company authorities -- would look only at how the risk management process BIS Review 31/1997 - 5 - affected their units. It is our belief that this simply will not be adequate. Risks managed on a consolidated basis cannot be reviewed on an individual legal entity basis by different supervisors. The latter logic motivated the congressional decision just five years ago to require that foreign banks could enter the United States if  and only if  they were subject to consolidated supervision. This decision  which is consistent with the international standards for consolidated supervision of banking organizations  was a good decision then. It is a good decision today  especially for those banking organizations whose disruption could cause major financial disturbances in United States and foreign markets. For foreign and for U.S. banking organizations  retreat from consolidated supervision would  the Board believes  be a significant step backward. We have to be careful  however  that consolidated umbrella supervision does not inadvertently so hamper the decisionmaking process of banking organizations as to render them ineffectual. The Federal Reserve Board is accordingly in the process of reviewing its supervisory structure and other procedures in order to reflect a market-directed shift from conventional balance sheet auditing to evaluation of the internal risk management process. Although focussed on the key risk management processes  it would sharply reduce routine supervisory umbrella presence in holding companies. As the Committee knows  the Board has recently published for comment proposals to expedite the applications process  and the legislation Congress enacted last year eased such procedures as well. Nonetheless  the Board requests even greater modification to its existing statutory mandate so that the required applications process could be sharply cut back  particularly in the area of nonbank financial services. In the Board’s view  those entities interested in banks are really interested in access to the safety net  since it is far easier to engage in the nonsafety net activities of banks without acquiring a bank. If an organization chooses to deliver some of its services with the aid of the sovereign credit by acquiring a bank  it should not be excused from efforts of the government to look out for the stability of the overall financial system. For bank holding companies  this implies umbrella supervision. Although that process will increasingly be designed to reduce supervisory presence and be as nonintrusive as possible  umbrella supervision should not be eliminated  but recognized for what it is: the cost of obtaining a subsidy. Nonetheless  we would hope that should the Congress authorize wider activities for financial services holding companies that it recognize that a bank which is a minor part of such an organization (and its associated safety net) can be protected through adequate bank capital requirements and the application of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The case is weak  in our judgment  for umbrella supervision of a holding company in which the bank is not the dominant unit and is not large enough to induce systemic problems should it fail. Subsidiaries  Subsidies  and Safety Nets The members of this Subcommittee are  I think  aware of the Board’s concerns that the safety net constructed for banks inherently contains a subsidy  that conducting new activities in subsidiaries of banks will inadvertently extend that subsidy  and that extension of any subsidy is undesirable. The Subcommittee recently heard testimony that there is no net subsidy and  therefore  the authorization of nonbank activities in bank subsidiaries would neither inadvertently extend this undesirable side effect of the safety net nor reduce the importance of the holding company as a consequence of the increased incentives to shift activities from the holding company to the bank. BIS Review 31/1997 Mr. Chairman  I would like briefly to comment on these latter views. Subsidy values -- net or gross -- vary from bank to bank; riskier banks clearly get a larger subsidy from the safety net than safer banks. In addition  the value of the subsidy varies over time; in good times  markets incorporate a low risk premium and when markets turn weak  financial asset holders demand to be compensated by higher yields for holding claims on riskier entities. It is at this time that subsidy values are the most noticeable. What was it worth in the late 1980s and early 1990s for a bank with a troubled loan portfolio to have deposit liabilities guaranteed by the FDIC  to be assured that it could turn illiquid to liquid assets at once through the Federal Reserve discount window  and to tell its customers that payment transfers would be settled on a riskless Federal Reserve Bank? For many  it was worth not basis points but percentage points. For some  it meant the difference between survival and failure. It is argued by some that the cost of regulation exceeds the subsidy. I have no doubt that the costs of regulation are large  too large in my judgment. But no bank has turned in its charter in order to operate without the cost of banking regulation  which would require that it operate also without deposit insurance or access to the discount window or payments system. To do so would require both higher deposit costs and higher capital. Indeed  it is a measure of the size of banks’ net subsidy that most nonbank financial institutions are required by the market to operate with significantly higher capital-to-asset ratios than banks. Most finance companies  for example  with credit ratings and debenture interest costs equal to banks are forced by today’s market to hold six or seven percentage points higher capital-to-asset ratios than those of banks. It is instructive that there are no private deposit insurers competing with the FDIC. For the same product offered by the FDIC  private insurers would have to charge premiums far higher than those of government insurance  and still not be able to match the certainty of payments in the event of default  the hallmark of a government insurer backed by the sovereign credit of the United States. The Federal Reserve has a similar status with respect to the availability of the discount window and riskless final settlement during a period of national economic stress. Providing such services is out of the reach of all private institutions. The markets place substantial values on these safety net subsidies  clearly in excess of the cost of regulation. To repeat  were it otherwise  some banks would be dropping their charters if there were not a net subsidy. In fact it is apparently the lower funding costs at banks that benefit directly from the subsidy of the safety net that has created the tendency for banking organizations to return to the bank and its subsidiaries many activities that are authorized to banks. These activities previously had been conducted in nonbank affiliates for reasons such as geographic and other inflexibilities  which have gradually eased. Indeed  over the last decade the share of consolidated assets of bank holding companies associated with nonbank affiliates -- other than Section 20 securities affiliates -- has declined almost half to just 5.2 percent. This tendency reflects the fact that asset growth that earlier had been associated with nonbank affiliates of bank holding companies -- consumer and commercial finance  leasing  and mortgage banking -- has most recently occurred largely in the bank or in a subsidiary of the bank. To be sure  as Chairman Helfer indicated to the Subcommittee earlier this month  many banking organizations still retain nonbank subsidiaries. Our discussions with bank holding companies  however  suggest that in some cases  these affiliates were acquired in the past and have established names and an interstate network whose value would be reduced if subsumed within a bank. There are also BIS Review 31/1997 - 7 - often adverse tax implications for the shift. And  finally  some of these activities may not be asset intensive and hence may not benefit significantly from bank funding. Clearly  the authorization of new activities in bank subsidiaries that are not now permitted either to banks or their affiliates would tend to accelerate the trend to reduce holding company activity  even if these activities were also permitted to holding company subsidiaries. The subsidy inherent in the safety net would assure that result  extending the spread of the safety net and requiring that the Federal Reserve’s authority and ability to meet its responsibilities be shifted to a different paradigm. Such a result is reason enough for our concern about the spreading of the safety net subsidy. But we should also be concerned because of the distortions subsidies bring to the financial system more generally. After all  the broad premise underlying financial modernization -- with its removal of legislative and regulatory restrictions -- is that free and often intense competition will create the most efficient and customer-oriented business system. This principle has proved itself  generation by generation  with ever higher standards of living. In financial  as well as most other  markets the principle is rooted in another premise -- that the interaction of private competitive forces will  with rare exceptions  create a stable error self-correcting system. This premise is very seriously called into question if government subsidies are supplied at key balancing points. By their nature  subsidies distort the establishment of competitive market prices  and create incentives that misalign private risks with private gains. Such distortions undermine the error self-correcting mechanisms that support strong financial markets. We must be very careful that in the name of free market efficiency we do not countenance greater powers and profits subsidized directly or indirectly by government. Conclusion Mr. Chairman  in conclusion  the Board believes that as the Congress moves toward financial modernization the newly created structure of financial organizations should limit  in so far as possible  the real and perceived transfer of the subsidy inherent in the safety net to nonbank activities. To maintain a level playing field for all competitors  nonbank activities must be financed at market  not subsidized  rates. The Board also believes that financial modernization should not undermine the ability and authority of the central bank of the United States to manage crises  assure an efficient and safe payment system  and conduct monetary policy. We believe all of these require that the Federal Reserve retain a significant and important role as a bank supervisor. In today’s structure  we have adequate authority and coverage to meet our responsibilities. But should erosion occur  as would likely be the case if new activities are authorized in bank subsidiaries  the Congress would have to consider what changes would be required in the Board’s supervisory authority to assure that it continues to be able to meet its central bank responsibilities.

Stals  at a Luncheon of the Rotary Club of Durban on 17/3/97. 1. Monetary policy and total economic activity At this stage  there is general expectation amongst economists in the private sector that monetary policy will be eased during the course of 1997. Differences of opinion may exist on how soon the easing will begin  or by how much interest rates will decline as a result of the easier conditions. This assumption is based  firstly  on a projection of some further slow-down in the rate of expansion of the total domestic economic activity. Last year  the rate of growth in gross domestic production declined to 3.1 per cent  down slightly from the 3.4 per cent of 1995. It must also be noted that the decline in the rate of growth in the non-agricultural sectors was even more pronounced  where the rate of increase in total real value added declined from 4½ per cent in 1995 to only 2 per cent in 1996. In the very important manufacturing sector  the decline was from 7½ per cent growth in 1995 to only ½ per cent in 1996. It was a strong recovery in the agricultural sector that maintained overall growth at the level of 3 per cent plus for last year. Agriculture will not make the same contribution to growth in 1997 and for economic analysis purposes it makes sense to assess the future prospects for non-agricultural production before deciding on a possible course for monetary policy during the rest of this year. There were some tentative signs that total manufacturing production may have started with a new expansionary phase in the fourth quarter of last year when a seasonally adjusted annualised decline of 1 per cent in the third quarter switched to a 2 per cent expansion in the fourth quarter. This expansion in production was boosted partly by a rising demand from the rest of the world for South African products  following the depreciation of the rand last year. This important development can make a further contribution to the maintenance of reasonable growth in 1997. Developments on the demand side of the economy also indicated a marked slow-down in total economic activity last year. The rate of increase in total domestic expenditure declined from 6.5 per cent in 1994 and 5.2 per cent in 1995  to 3.0 per cent in 1996. In this case  the decline was more broadly based and the rates of increase in gross domestic fixed investment  private sector consumption expenditure and accumulation of inventories all receded last year. There was only one exception  and that was consumption expenditure by general government which rose by 5 per cent in real terms  compared with an increase of only ½ per cent in 1995. This slower rate of increase in total domestic expenditure established better balance between production (supply) and expenditure (demand). With both sides of the economy now growing at about 3 per cent per annum  there is better equilibrium and less friction in the economy  which contributes also to more stable conditions in the financial markets. It is important that this balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply be retained -- both should gradually be raised to a higher level  but the upward movement should be in tandem. Monetary policy has an important part to play in maintaining this equilibrium over time. Any artificial stimulation of the economy through a premature easing of monetary policy will lead to further tensions in the balance of payments and in the financial markets  and will lead to further upward pressure on inflation. BIS Review 31/1997 At this stage  economists predict some further slow-down in the rate of increase in private sector consumption expenditure with continued growth at the current levels in gross domestic fixed investment. An important factor in this projection therefore will be the behaviour of government consumption expenditure. It is in this regard that the provision made by the Minister of Finance in his Budget Speech of last week for an increase in total government expenditure of only 6.1 per cent in 1997/98 is of vital importance. In real terms  that is after provision for depreciation  total government expenditure will indeed decline and therefore make an important contribution to the retention of macroeconomic equilibrium this year. 2. Monetary policy and the balance of payments Monetary policy decisions are obviously also affected by the overall balance of payments situation  and not only by developments in the domestic economy. Last year  international economic relations dominated the South African economic scene. Towards the end of the year  however  better equilibrium was also restored in the external accounts and this contributed to the expectation of an easier monetary policy in 1997. The current account of the South African balance of payments showed a substantial and growing deficit in the first half of 1996. In the second quarter  the seasonally adjusted annualised rate of the deficit reached R12.9 billion and there was justifiable concern that it could increase even further. Against the background of a slow-down in total domestic expenditure in the second half of the year  the growth in imports levelled off and  with some good increases in exports  the current account of the balance of payments improved to an annualised deficit of R4.7 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. Prospects are good that only a small deficit will be recorded in the current account of the balance of payments in 1997. The main reason for the balance of payments problems of last year was to be found in the capital account. The net capital inflow declined from R19.2 billion in 1995 to only R3.9 billion in 1996. The capital inflow was no longer sufficient to cover the deficit in the current account  and the official gross foreign reserves  which were at a very low level to begin with  declined by R5.4 billion. These developments exerted extreme pressures on the exchange rate of the rand and  as is well-known  the average weighted value of the rand against the basket of currencies of South Africa’s major trading partners depreciated by 21.9 per cent from 31 December 1995 to 31 December 1996. The balance of payments situation obviously demanded a restrictive monetary policy throughout the past twelve months. Here also  however  important changes took place after October 1996. The improvement in the domestic economic situation and in the current account of the balance of payments restored some confidence in the market for foreign exchange  particularly as the foreign reserves started rising again in the fourth quarter. The exchange rate of the rand reached a lower turning point in October 1996  stabilised in November and December and showed an impressive appreciation of about 9 per cent since the beginning of the new year. Optimism for the balance of payments for 1997 rests very strongly on the expectation that there will be a good net inflow of capital into the country during this year. So far  the results have been encouraging with a relatively strong demand for South African equities and bonds from non-residents. In January and February  non-residents were indeed net buyers of BIS Review 31/1997 - 3 - more than R5 billion of South African listed securities  but this total amount did not necessarily represent a net inflow of foreign exchange into the reserves. The announcements made by the Minister of Finance in his Budget Speech last week for the further relaxation of exchange controls can also have an important effect on the capital account of the balance of payments. It is difficult to forecast how much capital of residents may leave the country because of these relaxations  but it is generally assumed that this will be balanced by the inflow of more non-resident funds into the country. Indeed  it is not unreasonable to assume that a total net inflow of capital in excess of the projected current account deficit will add some amount to the official foreign exchange reserves during the course of this year. If these assumptions prove to be correct  the exchange rate of the rand  measured against the basket  should be more stable this year than the experience of last year. Such a balance of payments situation will also reduce pressure on monetary policy and will contribute to easier domestic financial conditions. 3. Monetary policy and the domestic financial situation In a more stable macroeconomic situation with better equilibrium in the balance of payments  monetary policy can be aimed more directly at influencing developments in the more important domestic financial aggregates. In a statement issued last Friday  the Reserve Bank indicated that the rate of increase in the M3 money supply should not exceed 10 per cent in 1997. This will provide for real growth in the economy at a rate of between 2 and 3 per cent  and inflation at a level well below 10 per cent. The Reserve Bank is concerned about the rising trend in inflation that gained substantial momentum during the course of 1996. The average rate of inflation for last year was 7.4 per cent  being the lowest rate of inflation South Africa had since 1972. The annual figure disguises the fact however  that inflation reached a lower turning point of 5.5 per cent in April 1996  and has since then risen to a level of 9.4 per cent in December 1996 and also in January 1997. In the fourth quarter of last year  the quarter-to-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised rate of inflation was as high as 12.7 per cent. The escalation in inflation was caused mainly by the depreciation of the rand  by sharp rises in food prices  by rising interest rates and also by a rise in the unit labour costs per unit of production. In this situation  however  it is imperative that the rate of increase in the money supply will be constrained  which requires a meaningful slow-down in the rate of increase in bank credit extension. Last year  the M3 money supply rose by 13.6 per cent  and total bank credit extended to the private sector by 16.1 per cent. If we want to make sure that the current trends in inflation will not be perpetuated  we must make sure that increases in the money supply will not automatically accommodate rising prices  or even further stimulate the inflationary pressures that are emerging from other sources. The most recent developments in the financial situation therefore do not emit the same optimistic signals emanating from the real economy and from the balance of payments for an early easing of monetary policy. On the contrary  the Reserve Bank would still want to see clear signs of a slow-down in the rates of increase in bank credit extension and in the money supply before lending official support to a decline in interest rates  or an easing in monetary policy in general. BIS Review 31/1997 4. Monetary policy and the Budget For monetary policy purposes  the most important aspect of the Fiscal Budget is the deficit that must be financed through borrowing by Government. A large deficit absorbs a greater share of the available savings of the private sector and therefore leaves less scope for expenditure in the private sector. A large deficit will force an increased demand from the private sector for more bank credit to replace what Government is withdrawing from the savings pool. More bank credit  however  creates more money and increases the risk of higher inflation in future. The Reserve Bank is therefore particularly pleased with the determined effort made by the Minister of Finance to reduce the deficit in the Budget from 5.4 per cent of gross domestic product in 1996/97 to 4.0 per cent in 1997/98. In absolute terms  the net borrowing requirement (i.e. the deficit after taking the opening cash balance into consideration) increased by only R1.3 billion  from R23.5 billion to R24.8 billion. Taking account of a much lower amount of maturing debt in the new fiscal year  the total gross borrowing requirement has in fact been reduced from R41.0 billion in the current fiscal year to R36.8 billion in the next. There are more reasons than just relieving pressure on monetary policy for reducing the deficit on the annual budget. One is  of course  the growing burden in the budget of the cost of servicing government debt. In the Budget Review Document  it was indicated that total Government debt as at the end of February 1997 amounted to R309.5 billion  equal to 55.3 per cent of gross domestic product. This is a relatively large deficit for a country with a relatively low overall savings ratio  and with massive needs for the development of infrastructure. For the 1997/98 fiscal year  total interest payments in the government debt will absorb R39 billion  or more than 20 per cent of the total expenditure. It is also laudable to note that the smaller deficit on the Budget is being achieved through constraints on government expenditure  and not through an increase in taxes. Both government expenditure at a level of 30 per cent and government revenue at 26 per cent of gross domestic product  are regarded as on the high side and there is a desire to reduce these levels over the next few years. This will further ease the burden on monetary policy. 5. Summary The 1997/98 Budget will  in summary  bring about a better balance in the monetary and fiscal policy mix that is required to maintain overall financial stability in the South African economy. In the longer term  as the implications of the Budget work through to the financial markets  it should reduce some pressure in monetary policy. In the short term  however  the main objective of monetary policy must be to force a similar mood of financial discipline also in the private sector. Not only government  but also private sector individuals and corporates must reduce their reliance on credit for the financing of their economic activity. Some decline in the rate of increase in the total amount of bank credit extension to the private sector  together with some slower growth in the total money supply  have become first priorities of monetary policy. This will be the only way to avoid the current inflationary pressures in the economy from being perpetuated into a new extended period of double digit inflation. BIS Review 31/1997

A moderate economic recovery continues in Japan as private demand shows increasing firmness. With respect to final demand  public-sector investment has decreased while net exports have continued on an increasing trend. Housing investment has remained at a high level and business fixed investment is increasing steadily. A moderate recovery in personal consumption has continued on the whole  while passenger car sales have increased significantly. Meanwhile  inventories on the whole are at appropriate levels. Reflecting these developments  industrial production has shown a steady increase and labor conditions on the whole have continued to improve moderately. Meanwhile  prices have stopped declining  and monetary aggregates have continued to grow at 3.0 - 4.0 per cent. With regard to personal consumption  sales at department stores and supermarkets are improving moderately  albeit with some fluctuations owing to such factors as weather conditions. Outlays for travel have continued to increase. Sales of electrical appliances are increasing on the whole  although the pace of growth in personal computers and cellular telephones has decelerated. Passenger car sales have recorded buoyant two-digit growth year-to- year for five consecutive months since October 1996. Among leading indicators of business fixed investment  machinery orders have increased steadily on average. They rose significantly in the fourth quarter 1996 and showed a marginal decline in January 1997 from the average of the fourth quarter. Construction floor area has also continued to pick up moderately. With respect to housing investment  housing starts in terms of the seasonally- adjusted annual rate have continued to be at a high level  although they have decreased for three consecutive months owing to the reversal of the rise in demand ahead of the consumption tax rate hike. Regarding public-sector showing developments in orders have decreased significantly since the end of 1996 compared to the high level recorded in the previous year  which reflected the large economic stimulus package. As for actual implementation of public works  with a time lag after orders  the seasonally-adjusted level of shipments of public-related goods increased until summer 1996  but has been decreasing since autumn 1996. investment  public works contracted Real exports are on an increasing trend reflecting the moderate expansion of overseas economies and the effects of the yen’s depreciation since summer 1995. Although real imports are increasing  reflecting such elements as the rise in domestic demand  the recent pace of increase has been moderate  a reflection of the depreciation of the yen to date. As a result  the real trade surplus turned to an increase in the second half of 1996. The nominal current-account surplus  however  is increasing at a much slower pace compared to the real trade surplus owing to the fluctuations in the income account and the hike in crude oil prices. Industrial production showed a significant increase in January 1997 after it increased by a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of over 10 per cent in the fourth quarter 1996. This increase was caused by the rise in final demand  particularly in those items conducive to production  such as passenger car sales  machinery investment  and net exports  under the circumstance in which inventories has been at appropriate levels. Although industrial production BIS Review 32/1997 - 2 - is expected to decline in February and March  the figure for the first quarter 1997 on average is also expected to show a steady increase. Labor market conditions have continued to improve moderately on the whole. Although the unemployment rate remains at a high level and employment growth has been moderate  growth in nominal wages has accelerated  reflecting the increase in production and corporate profits. The ratio of job offers to job applications has continued to improve. With respect to price developments  domestic wholesale prices (adjusted for seasonal electricity rates) have stopped declining  although downward pressures such as from competition with imports and technological innovation in  e.g.  electrical machinery  remain strong. This development has been supported by the yen’s depreciation to date  the hike in crude oil prices and the moderate improvement in domestic supply and demand conditions. Corporate service prices have declined  particularly in rents and leasing charges  but the year-to-year decrease has become smaller. Consumer prices (nationwide  excluding perishables) have somewhat exceeded the level of the previous year  as the decline in commodity prices has slowed against the background of the yen’s depreciation and the halt in the decline in domestic wholesale prices. Growth in monetary aggregates  measured in terms of the year-to-year growth rate of M2 + CDs average outstanding  has continued at 3.0 - 4.0 per cent  as corporate demand for funds has been increasing at a moderate pace. Regarding money market rates  the overnight call rate (uncollateralized)  together with the 3-month CD rate  has moved at a low level albeit with small fluctuations. Meanwhile  3-month Euro-yen futures have shown relatively minor movements at around 0.7 - 0.8 per cent after market’s expectations for higher interest rates receded at a brisk pace between summer and autumn 1996. In these circumstances  the long-term government bond yield has moved at about 2.3 - 2.4 per cent since the end of November 1996  but has recently declined to reach a record low of around 2.2 per cent. With respect to bank lending rates  the short-term prime lending rate has remained at a record low level of 1.625 per cent since September 1995. The long-term prime lending rate was lowered three times by a total of 0.8 percentage points since September 1996 in response to developments in the long-term interest rates  and has been moving at the record low of 2.5 per cent since December 1996. In these circumstances  short-term and long-term average contracted interest rates on new loans and discounts have moved at near record low levels. On the stock exchange  the Nikkei 225 stock average plummeted temporarily between the end of 1996 and the beginning of 1997  reflecting the market’s concerns about Japan’s economic outlook and balance-sheet problems. It has since picked up somewhat. In the foreign exchange market  the yen depreciated to reach ¥124 - 125 against the U.S. dollar temporarily in February 1997 owing to such factors as the interest rate differentials between Japan and the United States. Recently  the yen has moved at around ¥122 - 123 as concerns about the rapid appreciation of the U.S. dollar strengthened somewhat in the market. Meanwhile  the yen has been appreciating against the deutsche mark since mid-February and recently moved at around ¥72 - 73. BIS Review 32/1997

In February  according to the business leaders surveyed by the Banque de France  industrial output continued to increase in all sectors. The capacity utilization rate rose slightly. Overall demand grew at a moderate pace. There was strong demand from foreign markets  particularly from northern Europe  including Germany and the United Kingdom  and from the United States and Asia. The rise in the dollar and in sterling reinforced the competitiveness of French products. Growth in demand on the domestic market was much more moderate. Order books are deemed to be satisfactory in all sectors  with the exception of the food-processing industry  where they declined slightly and appear to be insufficient. Inventories of finished products are still somewhat above normal levels. In particular  they are considered to be above desired levels in the food-processing  intermediate goods and automobile sectors. In the coming months activity should continue to increase in all sectors  with the exception of the automobile sector. Commodity prices were stable overall. However  price rises were recorded in certain parts of the intermediate goods industry  such as the rubber and plastics  metal-working  and wood-processing sectors  and in the food processing industry owing to the appreciation of the dollar. Intense competition prevented these increases from being passed on to sales prices  which scarcely changed  except in the automobile sector  where they declined. The business leaders surveyed continued to be cautious in their investment plans. There were few plans for large-scale investment  and they mainly concerned the renewal of modernization of existing equipment. Retail sales contracted in February  after posting a substantial rise in January. Employment levels remained stable in industry  except in the automobile sector  where they declined. The retail and market services sectors showed little change  but employment fell in the building industry. Increasing use was made of flexi-time  annualized working time and part-time working to respond to variations in demand. BIS Review 32/1997

Today I shall be considering this field in terms of three topical issues: - First there is the path of inflation in recent years. In this context I shall dwell on the significance of transitory effects  not just for recent price tendencies but also more in principle. - Next comes the issue of employment. What can monetary policy do to help create new jobs in Sweden? - The third matter is the rule system for monetary policy. What is the point of delegating the management of monetary policy and the task of establishing low inflation to a central bank? In this connection I will also look at various proposals that are being discussed at present for amending the rules for the Riksbank. Inflation and monetary policy Price stability is the Riksbank’s paramount objective  specified in the target of keeping the increase in the consumer price index to 2 per cent  with a tolerance interval of – 1 percentage point. There is a time lag of one to two years before a monetary policy measure has its full effect on inflation. Our discussion should therefore focus on future inflation. But first I want to say something about inflation in the past year. Inflation and the transitory effects The CPI is used by the Riksbank to target inflation mainly because it is familiar  published monthly with a short time lag and seldom has to be revised. However  using the CPI as a target variable is liable to face monetary policy with explanatory problems. The past year is a case in point. The low rate of inflation stemmed mainly from transitory effects; the consolidation of government finance and increased confidence in economic policy helped to strengthen the exchange rate. During 1996 it proved possible to lower the instrumental rates almost 5 percentage points. Altogether  in 1996 decreased interest costs and the stronger exchange rate had a downward effect on the CPI of around 1 percentage point. In some countries the inflation target is assessed in terms of the CPI with various components excluded  for example indirect taxes and subsidies or mortgage interest costs. It may then be asked whether the CPI is the most appropriate target variable and whether some measurement of underlying inflation might be preferable. An advantage of focusing on a single underlying indicator is that it might help the Riksbank in its contacts with the general public and make monetary policy more transparent. Analysis and debate would be concentrated on factors that monetary policy influences. BIS Review 32/1997 - 2 - This  however  presupposes the existence of an underlying yardstick that can take every conceivable transitory effect into account. Such measurements are difficult to construct. Specifying all the circumstances that have to be considered so as to obtain the best picture of underlying inflation and doing this in advance is not a simple matter. Using underlying inflation also has the drawback that essential information about the inflation process may be overlooked. For example  changes in import prices are a part of the domestic inflation process because they affect price setting in trade. In the present state of our art  the drawbacks of changing to a measure of underlying inflation for the Riksbank’s monetary policy are greater than the advantages. As I have indicated  however  the CPI may be markedly affected by transitory effects. It is therefore important to monitor measurements of underlying inflation that have been stable over time. The path of the underlying inflation process is an important factor in the Riksbank’s monetary policy decisions. Gradual recovery In growth terms  1996 was weaker than 1994 and 1995. The slowdown mainly came from marked stock reductions and a contraction of public sector operations. But even the growth of final demand in the private sector tended to slacken in 1996. There are now clear signs of an economic recovery; the volume growth of exports remains high  along with indications that a stronger increase in private consumption is on the way. What  then  will be inflation’s path in the years ahead? The Riksbank considers that at present the Swedish economy has unutilised resources and even if growth does pick up during 1997 and 1998  it is unlikely that these resources will be activated to such an extent that the inflation target is in danger. The scenario in the December inflation report involves a gradual increase in the rate of inflation in the coming years. The main explanation for this upward movement is that the transitory effects - from lower interest rates and a stronger exchange rate - which kept inflation down in 1996 will be fading. The registered rate of CPI inflation is then expected to approach inflation’s underlying trend  which in the years ahead is judged to be more or less in line with the inflation target. Lower inflation propensity The new price and other economic information in recent months reinforces the impression that price pressure is low. To this extent  the conditions for fulfilling the inflation target have improved. On the other hand  a weaker exchange rate has already tended to stimulate activity. The outlook for inflation and the rapid progress in consolidating government finance suggest that there is room for a fall in long bond rates. Underlying economic factors indicate  moreover  that the recent depreciation has left the krona undervalued  so that it should appreciate. How should the exchange rate be assessed in connection with monetary policy decisions? According to experience in recent years  the impact of a depreciation on domestic prices is limited. But domestic demand has been weak. Provided there is stable confidence in the policy for price stability  price effects from a weakening of the exchange rate are generally BIS Review 32/1997 - 3 - transitory. A depreciation is a problem for monetary policy only when it has a lasting expansionary effect or if inflation expectations rise. The economy’s inflation propensity  which seems to have decreased in recent years  is an important factor to consider when assessing the threat from future inflation. The term inflation propensity stands here for the structure of the inflation process  which is liable to be changed by various factors. If stronger competition  for example  in certain segments of trade results in lower price increases than before when consumption is rising  then the economy has a lower inflation propensity. Examples of factors that may have helped to reduce the inflation propensity are the fall in market expectations of inflation and the higher acceptance of the Riksbank’s inflation target. Another cause of a decreased inflation propensity can be lower inflation as such. Price comparisons are easier for households and firms when inflation is low. Price increases are more visible and producers have more difficulty in raising prices without a relative price shift. The situation in this respect is one of the main issues that the Riksbank will have to evaluate. We shall be returning to this later in the year. All in all  the picture that emerges of the Swedish economy suggests that the monetary stance is well balanced. Major changes have occurred in the past year  for instance in the repo rate. Time is needed to assess their effects. This also motivates a cautious line in monetary policy. 2. Employment and what monetary policy can do The low inflation in the past few years has been accompanied by respectable growth. Since 1994 economic growth has averaged 2.7 per cent a year  which is higher than the normal rate in recent decades. Given the low capacity utilisation initially  the high growth as such is not remarkable. What is more surprising - and alarming - is that a recovery of employment seems to be considerably more sluggish than the upswing in total production. The problem of generating new jobs is by no means peculiar to Sweden but something we have in common with much of Europe. The situation in this respect contrasts markedly with the United States. There are also exceptions in Europe  one being the Netherlands in the past decade. This suggests that cures for the high unemployment exist  though naturally the solutions in other countries may not apply as a whole to Swedish conditions. The high unemployment in Sweden is now a subject of intensive discussion. Today I shall try to describe in principle what monetary policy is capable of doing and what it is not in a position to achieve. Restricted potential in the longer run In an analysis of monetary policy’s potential for influencing employment it is natural to make a distinction between the short and the longer run. It is generally agreed that monetary policy can be used to affect production and employment in the short run. An important reason why monetary policy is capable  at least in principle  of influencing employment in this time perspective is the existence of rigidities in price and wage formation. Suppose  for example  that low wage settlements are concluded with a certain rate of inflation in mind. If monetary policy becomes more expansionary and inflation takes off  wage costs will be lower than expected in real terms. It will pay firms better to take on additional labour and employment will rise. In the short run  then  one can expect a trade-off between inflation (or the extent to which monetary policy is expansionary) and employment (or unemployment). BIS Review 32/1997 - 4 - The existence of such a short-term trade-off does not mean  however  that it will serve to raise employment permanently. This is because when actual inflation changes  economic agents (firms  employees  etc.) normally adjust their expectations of future inflation. So in the next round of wage agreements  for example  employees may demand compensation for a higher expected rate of inflation. Changing expectations mean that the trade-off between inflation and unemployment ceases to be stable. This is intuitively intelligible. If the normal rate of inflation is  say  5 per cent  it seems reasonable that employment will rise if inflation moves up to 10 per cent because this reduces wage costs in real terms. In the figure this amounts to moving from A to B. In time  however  10 per cent inflation will be regarded as normal and wage demands will be based on this level. With higher nominal wage increases  real wage costs will move up again and unemployment will tend to return to its initial level. In the figure this means moving from B to C. In order to boost employment in this situation  inflation would have to rise to say 15 per cent and the procedure will be repeated. All that is ultimately achieved is higher average inflation. The level of unemployment to which an economy returns when inflation expectations have adjusted is usually referred to as equilibrium unemployment. It is determined by structural factors such as demographic changes  technology and the institutional set-up in the labour market  factors that are immune to monetary policy. The important conclusion to draw from this is that permanently low unemployment cannot be achieved by accepting permanently high inflation. Under favourable circumstances  to which I will shortly return  monetary policy can promote an economic recovery; but an appreciable improvement in the unemployment situation calls for measures in many other fields  above all in the workings of the labour market and wage formation. What should monetary policy aim for? If a central bank is incapable of “creating jobs” on a permanent basis  what should be its primary task? By means of an appropriately balanced monetary policy a central bank can determine  or at least strongly influence  the rate of inflation that prevails in the economy and underlies economic decisions by firms and households. Price increases are  of course  conditioned by many other factors  such as the economic situation  the fiscal stance  wage formation and so on. But inflation is a monetary phenomenon and in the longer run the Riksbank  by controlling the supply of money in a wide sense  can also control its value in terms of inflation. The perception that the primary task of a central bank should be to maintain price stability can be said to have won general acceptance. In that low  stable inflation helps to improve the functioning of markets  it seems reasonable that  indirectly  monetary policy also promotes economic growth and employment. In their economic decisions  households and firms have one less source of uncertainty - inflation - to worry about. The inability of monetary policy to affect long-term employment and the fact that it should focus on maintaining price stability does not mean that its capacity to condition production and employment in the short run can not sometimes be used for stabilising activity. Monetary policy can contribute to an economic recovery in so far as this is feasible without jeopardising price stability. Problems may arise  however  if monetary policy is perceived as BIS Review 32/1997 - 5 - The Phillips curve T h e P h illip c u r ve Inf latio n BB AA Inf latio n U n e m p lo ym e nt BB CC U n e m p lo ym e nt BIS Review 32/1997 - 6 - focusing primarily on the stabilisation of employment. As we have seen  people’s expectations play a major part in the inflation process. If people expect monetary policy to concentrate in the first place on stabilising employment  then firms and employees will not regard unduly high wage increases as all that serious because they will count on measures being taken to stimulate demand if employment is in danger. Sweden in the 1970s and ’80s is a good illustration of the problems that may arise. Wage and price increases in that period were systematically higher than in other countries  which led to recurrent cost crises and problems with competitiveness. An important reason for the lack of adjustment to wage increases in the rest of the world was that employees and firms reckoned that the government and the Riksbank would ultimately bail them out with devaluations  which is what actually happened. In this way inflation expectations were adjusted in advance to an anticipated pattern of economic policy reactions  whereby high price and wage increases were accepted or accommodated by devaluing the krona. As a result  strong inflationary mechanisms were built into the economy. As we have seen in recent years  once such mechanisms have been established  they are difficult to change. 3. Monetary policy’s rule system Experience has shown that more is needed than proud declarations from political decision-makers that they will safeguard a stable value of money and are not prepared to adapt policy to excessively high wage increases. We heard plenty of that in the 1980s. One way of enhancing credibility that has been found to work well and is supported by economic theory is for the democratically elected body to delegate monetary policy to a central bank with a clear  specified obligation to safeguard the value of money. The central bank is given full control over the instruments  principally the short interest rate  for fulfilling the stipulated objective. This arrangement limits both the room for short-run attempts to boost employment and the risk of inflationary mechanisms taking root in the economy. That also lessens the risk of a repetition of what happened in the early 1990s when the inflation bubble burst and unemployment rose. Credibility provides greater manoeuvrability It may be worth underscoring that a system where price stability is credibly delegated to the central bank can confer greater freedom of action in economic policy. This may seem paradoxical but if people feel they can rely on the central bank  in an economic slowdown it may be possible to ease the monetary stance without triggering higher inflation expectations and bond rates  because everyone counts on policy being tightened before inflation moves up. We have experienced something of this sort in Sweden in the past year. In a system with poor credibility  a monetary easing may be perceived as a sign of a lasting upward shift in inflation. This in turn may generate self-fulfilling expectations  with future problems when efforts are made to control inflation once more. It is understandable that the risk of this is seen as particularly great in economies where inflation has been high for a long time. A more independent central bank is thus in a better position not only to maintain low inflation but also to operate at times with a policy that includes an element of stabilisation (though the problems of fine tuning stabilisation policy should not be underestimated). The German central bank is one example; over a series of decades  economic slowdowns could be parried by lowering the short interest rate fairly rapidly and markedly. It may be in place to point out that credibility and  for that matter  independence can be achieved in various ways. Some countries have recently clarified their regulations so as to BIS Review 32/1997 - 7 - bring them into line with the arrangement I have just advocated. One example is New Zealand. In other countries  for instance the United States  policy has been conducted so that it has gradually earned increasing confidence within the time-honoured system. In my opinion the rule system is important; it reflects the general commitment to monetary policy and can provide a short cut to credibility. In a democratic society  however  monetary policy is ultimately founded on popular support. That is one reason why it is important for the Riksbank to operate in such a way that confidence is created in the policy of price stability. Among other things  this calls for a clear intellectual framework that can be evaluated and for an open discussion about the direction of monetary policy. Delegates accountable to a democratic body An argument that is heard from time to time in the monetary policy debate is that the delegation of monetary policy’s construction to an independent central bank would be undemocratic. In my view that is incorrect. The Riksbank is an agency of the Riksdag (Sweden’s parliament)  which clearly can stipulate the objective which the Riksbank is to aim for. It is worth emphasising  however  that it would naturally be inappropriate for the Riksdag to set up objectives that the Riksbank is not in a position to fulfil  like that - as we saw earlier - of “creating jobs” on a permanent basis. When  but only when  the Riksbank’s objective has been established  will it be possible to monitor operations effectively. It should be realised that the delegation of monetary policy to an independent central bank is a way of generating confidence that the declared policy of the Riksdag and the government will in fact be implemented. In the coming years the rule system for monetary policy will be changed. As an adherent to the Maastricht Treaty  Sweden has undertaken to make changes in  for example  the status of the Riksbank’s governor. He or she shall not be dismissed except on explicit grounds of serious misconduct  etc. Neither is the Riksbank to be given instructions from third parties  e.g. government  except in a statutory form. It also looks as though the objective of the Riksbank is to be formulated in law and will be price stability. The question of eligibility to serve on the governing board will have to be reviewed. Active members of parliament are delegates in Sweden  which is entirely contrary to traditions in central Europe. The Riksbank differs from most central banks in Europe in that we are formally responsible for exchange rate policy. The Government sees this as a problem in EU cooperation and has therefore instituted an enquiry into exchange rate competence. In the light of what I have just said  these conclusions are not sound. The proposal to transfer responsibility for exchange rate policy from the Riksbank to the government makes it more difficult for the Riksbank to safeguard the value of money effectively and thereby contribute to a favourable level of interest rates and also - when this does not endanger price stability - to stimulate the economy and employment. In a world with free capital flows there is a direct link between monetary and exchange rate policies. The two policy fields may have conflicting goals. Moreover  if the government  via exchange rate decisions  can affect the ability of the Riksbank to fulfil the inflation target  there may be misunderstandings about where responsibility for the operation of monetary policy lies. In my opinion it may be reasonable - though this  too  is questioned by some economists - for the government to decide the type of exchange rate system Sweden is to have in relation to other EU countries  whether the krona should join the European exchange rate mechanism or remain flexible. There is a close connection here with the rules and regulations BIS Review 32/1997 - 8 - that apply in the rest of the EU and the matter is very much a political issue. But within a given exchange rate system  it is the Riksbank that should decide an appropriate rate for the krona or the band within which it may move. Such decisions can be made after an exchange of information with the government but in the final analysis it should be up to the Riksbank to determine whether or not they are compatible with price stability. With a flexible exchange rate  policy should operate  as today  with an inflation target  and the government should have no possibility of influencing the construction of exchange rate policy. Democratic control is important. But it should be exercised via the Riksbank’s principal  the Riksdag  on whose behalf monetary policy is conducted. It should be noted that in exceptional situations  when the price stability objective may have to be suspended for the time being (e.g. a major oil price shock)  both the government and the Riksbank may call on the Riksdag to amend the Riksbank’s statutory objective. In that way the democratic control of monetary policy can be clearly ensured. BIS Review 32/1997

Duisenberg  President of the Netherlands Bank and of the Bank for International Settlements  on the occasion of the Board meeting of the Banking Federation of the European Union held in Maastricht on 20-21/3/97.,Dr. Duisenberg discusses strategies for monetary policy in EMU Address by Dr. W.F. Duisenberg  President of the Netherlands Bank and of the Bank for International Settlements  on the occasion of the Board meeting of the Banking Federation of the European Union held in Maastricht on 20-21/3/97. It is with great pleasure that I am addressing you on the European Economic and Monetary Union here in Maastricht today  the very location where that Union was pieced together. It was here that we made a concerted effort some five years ago to lay the foundations for the economic and monetary stability of Europe in the 21st century. Since then we have been busily building on these foundations with the result that we now have the outlines of the European Central Bank. The framework for monetary policy contains three main elements: its primary objective  strategy and instruments. Where the first is concerned  there can be no misunderstanding: the Maastricht Treaty prescribes that the overriding objective of ECB policy shall be price stability. Knowing you all to be distinguished financial and monetary experts  I need hardly point out to you that to attain this objective  strategy must be transparent and credible. It is not for nothing that in recent months this issue has been figuring prominently on the agenda of the European Monetary Institute  the precursor of the ECB. Let me give you a brief impression of the consultations held there. As soon as it has been decided in early 1998 which countries are to take part in EMU  the ECB will decide what monetary strategy to pursue. Generally speaking  there are two aspects to such a strategy: internal decision-making within the central bank and  equally important  the presentation of its measures to the outside world. In fact both aspects hinge on the question which variables should underlie the central banks interest rate policy and what weight should be assigned to each of these variables. After all  monetary policy is complicated by the fact that inflation reacts to the central bank’s interest rate decisions with long and varied lags. Actual inflation rates are therefore not cut out to be a gauge of monetary conditions. The central bank should focus on information which provides insight into future inflation  and possibly formulate a number of intermediate objectives  the so-termed intermediate target variables: in Europe today the money supply and the exchange rate often figure as such. The exchange rate in particular plays a major role in open economies  where inflation is due largely to external factors. However  EMU will be a large and relatively closed area  where inflation is determined mainly by internal developments. There is therefore no question of the ECB conducting an active exchange rate policy vis-à-vis the dollar or the yen. That is why I will be discussing only two possible strategies for future monetary policy in Europe: monetary targeting  such as that pursued by the Deutsche Bundesbank for years already  and direct inflation targeting  the strategy applied by the Bank of England. Monetary targeting is underlain by the notion that in the medium to long term inflation is invariably caused by excessive money growth. In this line of thinking  the central bank can attain its objective of price stability simply by keeping the expansion of the money supply under control. That does not mean to say that the central bank will focus exclusively on monetary growth. Other aggregates containing information about inflationary prospects  especially in the near future  will be monitored as well. These factors act notably as “qualifiers”  warning policy-makers against relying excessively on their automatic pilot. Apart from rules  this strategy therefore also provides for a certain measure of flexibility. In this context  I wish to dissociate myself emphatically from those who are wont to accuse my colleagues at the Bundesbank of “rigidity” and “monetary dogmatism”. The necessary flexibility is coupled to a high degree of transparency as the central bank explains to the general public how it has BIS Review 32/1997 - 2 - determined its monetary target for the coming period  and goes to great lengths retrospectively to set out the reasons for any deviations from that target. By stressing its responsibility for monetary conditions  the central bank subjects itself to a certain discipline. For the central bank to be able to live up to this responsibility  the monetary aggregate to be chosen should meet three requirements. First of all  it should be sufficiently controllable. Generally speaking  an increase in the short-term interest rate will eventually lead to a decrease of the money supply. I deliberately say “generally speaking” because monetary policy-makers remember only too well what happened after German unification  when the reverse effect arose at first. Fortunately we now also know that such episodes may be short- lived. Secondly  there must be a sufficiently stable long-term relationship between the demand for money and its determinants  such as prices  income  interest rates and wealth. I will go into this in more detail later on. In the third place  the monetary aggregate needs to have predictive powers as to future inflation. If it does  money growth can be a useful indicator of future inflation. In the 1980s  monetary targeting was abandoned by several industrialised countries notably on the grounds that national money demand was becoming unstable as a result of financial innovations. It had thus become difficult to assess to what extent changes in monetary growth would be translated into higher prices. The central banks of some of these countries have meanwhile switched to a strategy aimed directly at the attainment of price stability. Their switch was  incidentally  often prompted by the implicit desire of policy-makers to prop up their reputation following years of relatively poor performances in terms of inflation. In 1989  my colleagues from New Zealand were the first to adopt direct inflation targeting. They were followed by Canada  the United Kingdom  Sweden  Finland  Spain and Australia. Although the name suggests otherwise  direct inflation targeting  too  makes use of an intermediate target  viz. expected inflation. As expectations are by definition hard to quantify  information variables are employed to forecast future inflation. If the predicted inflation rate deviates from the target  interest rate adjustment is called for. With a view to forecasting  direct inflation targeting employs  as I have pointed out  several information variables. Such variables are  for instance  changes in wage costs  the exchange rate  commodity prices  equity prices and the money supply. As soon as these indicators point towards rising inflation  the central bank needs to take action. However  the explicit use of a variety of indicators poses a threat to the transparency and credibility of monetary policy  because there is then no immediate way of knowing which information has prompted interest rate decisions. In order to remedy this problem  most countries pursuing inflation targeting have taken to publishing inflation reports setting out the backgrounds to policy measures. Such reports also enable the public to ascertain whether a central bank can be held accountable if the inflation target is not attained. After all  inflation may be caused by factors which are beyond the control of monetary authorities. It is for this reason that most countries cite circumstances under which the inflation target may be ignored or requires adjustment. For example  a number of central banks are not under any obligation to take corrective measures when indirect taxes are raised or when exogenous shocks such as energy price increases arise. As you can see  the two strategies are actually not as different as their names would have us believe. In practice  elements from both strategies are used  the distinction not always being as clear as it is in theory. The two strategies share the following properties: - both seek the attainment of the same ultimate goal  viz. price stability; - both are forward-looking; BIS Review 32/1997 - 3 - - and both make use of an extensive set of indicators to be able to assess whether the course pursued is the right one. In fact the different weights assigned to the money supply form the main distinction between the two strategies. If the two strategies differ so little in daily practice  how can we compare their pros and cons? To make comparison possible  it has been agreed within the EMI that the ECB will base its choice of monetary strategy on six general criteria  to wit effectiveness  accountability  transparency  medium-term orientation  continuity and consistency with the independence of the ECB. Obviously the criterion of effectiveness is more general in nature than the other five  which can be said to contribute to effectiveness each in their own way. Let us take a brief look at all of them. Any assessment of monetary targeting has always stressed the criterion of effectiveness. As I pointed out earlier  the effectiveness of this policy is determined by the controllability  the stability and the predictive powers of the monetary aggregate selected. In this context  special attention has always been paid to the stability of money demand. The EMI and other institutions have already extensively studied the stability of money demand for certain groups of EU countries. Though perhaps not quite representative of the situation in Stage Three  the results can be called encouraging so far. It turns out that European money demand functions evince greater stability than comparable relationships for individual countries  Germany included. However  the countries concerned must be sufficiently integrated and converged. Compared to monetary targeting  direct inflation targeting is harder to assess in terms of effectiveness. This is due to the fact that interest rate measures work through to inflation via all sorts of complicated macro-economic processes  with inflation right at the end of the chain. Direct inflation targeting  too  calls for a sufficient measure of stability of these relationships. Obviously effectiveness is in any case highly dependent on the quality of the inflation forecasts. Moreover  the central bank must be free to react pre-emptively and adequately to any deviations between the desired and the predicted rates of inflation. In the second place  it must be possible to hold the central bank accountable for the consequences of its policy. It must account for its decisions and explain them to the public. This enhances the confidence which the public at large has in the central bank and contributes to its credibility. As the ECB will be equipped with an adequate range of instruments  it can be held accountable for developments with regard to the money supply. But inflation is determined by more factors  some of which are less amenable to central bank control. That might let the central bank off the hook in the sense that it feels it cannot be considered wholly responsible for any overshooting of a direct inflation target. Thirdly  policy must be transparent. That means that the public must be informed on both which objectives are being pursued and how decisions have been arrived at. Those in favour of direct inflation targeting like to point out the fact that inflation is a more comprehensible concept than the money supply. On the other hand  transparency is well served when communication with the public at large centres on a single aggregate. In the case of direct inflation targeting  there is the risk that the outside world does not comprehend which indicator has been used this time  a problem which can be solved to some extent by issuing inflation reports. Fourthly  policy should not be tailored to individual developments  but should have a medium-term orientation  providing some breathing space when the target is not met in the short term. Above all this means that policy should be credible  offering a clear anchor for inflation expectations. Irrespective of the strategy chosen  monetary authorities do not react to every news item which comes their way. Wavering monetary policies only create unrest among both the public and financial market operators. BIS Review 32/1997 - 4 - In the fifth place  monetary policy should be characterised by sufficient continuity while all too frequent policy changes should be avoided. The continuity of monetary policy in Europe would be best served by monetary targeting  the strategy applied for several decades already by the most successful central bank in Europe  viz. the Bundesbank. Moreover  a large proportion of the other core group countries have attuned their exchange rate policies to Germany. One downside of direct inflation targeting as a policy option for the ECB is that little experience has been gained so far with this strategy in periods of heavy inflationary pressure. At the same time it should be kept in mind that the inflation performance of countries which have switched to direct inflation targeting has clearly improved over time. Finally  the policy strategy selected will need to be consistent with the ECB’s independence. By this I mean to say that the strategy chosen must not inspire outsiders to meddle in the discussions on interest rate policy. The Maastricht Treaty is perfectly clear on this point. It would be undesirable if any inflationary differences within the Union were to lead to politicisation of the interest rate policy within the ECB Governing Council. It seems to me that this risk is greater in the case of direct inflation targeting than if monetary targeting were pursued. I am approaching the end of my address. I have told you which considerations underlie the choice of a monetary policy for the ECB and I have outlined the differences between monetary targeting and direct inflation targeting. The success of either strategy is dependent on largely identical factors. Here a key role is played by vital concepts such as credibility and transparency. It would be recommendable to inform the public regularly and in general terms of the considerations underlying interest rate measures. Furthermore  the ECB will in any case  in the daily implementation of its monetary policy  have to take into account the various indicators which contain information about future price movements. All in all the differences between the two strategies should not be exaggerated. Nevertheless  I profess that the considerations which I have set out lead me so far to have a certain preference for monetary targeting. The success of the Bundesbank shows that this strategy underpins the competence of the central bank  thus offering an optimum safeguard for its independence. Should you have a different view  then I hope that my address has contributed to a dynamic start-up of the discussion ahead. BIS Review 32/1997

Anyone who has read our last Monetary Policy Report  the winter issue of the Bank of Canada Review  or our just-released Annual Report knows that the Bank has been positive about Canada’s economic outlook. Basically  we are looking for a solid pickup in the pace of economic expansion in coming months  with inflation remaining low. And  with improvements in the basic foundation of our economy  we see the potential for sustained good economic performance over the medium term. Not everyone is as upbeat as we are. Some analysts are rather sceptical  especially of the fairly strong recovery that we foresee in household spending. They see Canadian households carrying too much debt  a personal savings rate that is already too low  and an unemployment rate that is too high to sustain much of an increase in spending. Others seem to have difficulty reconciling an optimistic outlook on the rate of economic expansion with a scenario of continued low inflation. In this group  some are afraid that the Bank will react too quickly to an acceleration of inflation  frustrating the economic recovery. Another camp is worried that the Bank will let inflation get away  with all the costs that that would entail. Today  I would like to use this opportunity to address some of these issues. I believe that I can offer good reasons -- and monetary policy is one of them -- why we in Canada should be upbeat about our economic future. Why is the Bank optimistic about an expanding economy? The Canadian economy has been undergoing extensive transformation. And clearly we are not out of the restructuring woods yet. This restructuring has been spawned by rapid technological advancements  increasingly open and competitive world markets  the decline of inflation in Canada from the high levels of the past  and the need to reverse an unsustainable trend of debt accumulation  particularly by Canadian governments. But over the last few years  Canada has made great strides in dealing with these issues. As a result  I believe that we now have a much more efficient and competitive private sector. We also have a fundamentally improved macroeconomic policy situation. Fiscal policy has been successful in reducing deficits  and governments have been moving towards less vulnerable debt positions. Inflation the Bank’s inflation-control target range. low and relatively stable within is Together  these improvements in our basic economic circumstances have facilitated the major decline that we have seen in domestic interest rates over the past year or so. Many interest rates in Canada are now at their lowest levels since the 1960s. And for maturities of up to 10 years  they are also below comparable U.S. rates by the widest margins we have seen in many years. Some of the gloom about the economy during the past year had to do with the perception that the stimulus to economic activity from the decline in interest rates was taking a long time to have its effects on spending and employment. There are  of course  lags in the BIS Review 34/1997 - 2 - impact of monetary policy actions on the economy that are widely believed to be of the order of 12 to 18 months. However  what may not have been widely appreciated was that the reductions in short-term rates that began in the spring of 1995 initially just reversed the runup in rates that occurred after the Mexican currency crisis and before the 1995 federal budget. The real easing in monetary conditions relative to 1994 effectively started only in late 1995  following the Quebec referendum  and continued for one year to late 1996. Therefore  it is not surprising that signs of the response to that easing have only been apparent quite recently. Because of the lags involved  the contribution of the easier monetary conditions to a stronger expansion in output and employment should continue for some time. Thus  we expect the economy to expand at rates in excess of the growth in potential output through 1997 and 1998. In other words  we anticipate that the margin of unused capacity in our economy will shrink substantially over the next couple of years. As I noted  there are those who view this outlook with scepticism. For them  it is not a question of lags. They argue that the current very low interest rates will not do enough to encourage additional household spending  given high debt levels  a low savings rate  and high unemployment. I will not tell you that these factors cannot temper the response to low interest rates. Of course they can. But I do not believe they are sufficiently important to offset it. Let me take the arguments in turn. First  household debt levels. Yes  they are high relative to personal disposable income -- over 90 per cent. But the burden of servicing this debt represents only 8 per cent of disposable income -- well down from the peak in 1990 -- and is expected to continue to fall as debt is rolled over  or new debt taken on  at lower interest rates. In addition  over three-quarters of household debt is in mortgages  which have financed the purchase of houses. Households have also been accumulating financial investments. In fact  the net worth of the household sector has been rising  although  of course  the assets and debts are not equally distributed across households. The important point I want to make is that  if you take the household sector as a whole  it is not buried under a mountain of debt  with high servicing costs  no assets  and no spending power. Second  the personal savings rate. In this case  there are valid concerns that we have been underestimating savings by ignoring capital gains  particularly on investments in stocks  given the rise in the stock market. If we look at the conventional measure of personal savings  the savings rate of 3¼ per cent in the fourth quarter of 1996 is indeed low. But this does not mean that it could not remain low for a time (or even go lower temporarily) while the economy is recovering. This is  in fact  what we would expect to happen if significant numbers of households decided to cash in some of their accumulated financial assets in order to spend. Third  the high unemployment rate. This argument sounds like a ""Catch 22"": the high unemployment rate discourages people from spending  which keeps unemployment high  which discourages spending still more. I believe that this grim picture overstates the problem  given that over 90 per cent of the workforce is employed. And yes  there are still cutbacks and layoffs  especially in the public sector. However  private sector employment continues to expand. Since the beginning of 1996  the private sector generated some 210 000 net new jobs  six times as many as were lost in the public sector. Undoubtedly  employment concerns remain  but the quickening of output growth that began in the second half of last year should lead to BIS Review 34/1997 - 3 - sustained growth in private sector employment over the course of 1997  and to improved consumer confidence. You can see that I did not find the arguments against a strong comeback in consumer spending persuasive. Moreover  these negative influences must be weighed against the size of the easing in interest rates that has taken place since late 1995. Short-term rates are down by about 3 percentage points  medium-term rates by 2 percentage points and longer-term rates by 1½ percentage points. Another indicator of the extent of easing in monetary conditions is the growth of the narrowly-defined monetary aggregate  M1. This aggregate  which provides advance information on the near-term expansion of the real economy  has recently accelerated to a year-over-year growth rate of over 15 per cent. But  of course  in the end  it is the recent evidence from the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy that is the most telling. As the economic results for the second half of 1996 show  and the more recent monthly indicators confirm  there have been substantial increases in spending on housing  motor vehicles and other consumer durables. Sales in these sectors have picked up in response to the lower interest rates  just as expected. All things considered  I believe there are good reasons to expect solid economic expansion in coming months. What are the risks that inflation will accelerate? Let me now turn to the inflation implications of this scenario. If the economy grows at the above-potential rates that the Bank foresees  won’t inflation accelerate? As I noted  this question seems to lead to two  quite opposite  concerns. One group of commentators fears that the Bank will respond  either too quickly or unnecessarily  to an acceleration of inflation and cut off the economic expansion. Another group worries that the Bank will let inflation get away  resulting in another cycle of boom and bust. There seems to be a certain confusion around this issue. Some people apparently assume that it is the speed at which the economy is growing that determines whether inflationary pressures will increase or decrease. While the rate of growth is not irrelevant  what really matters is the level of economic activity relative to the production capacity of the economy -- in other words  the margin of slack or the output gap in the economy. The size of the output gap  interacting with inflation expectations  is the principal force behind increased or decreased inflationary pressure. Thus  one would expect inflation to start accelerating only after a period in which the level of aggregate demand had exceeded the economy’s capacity to produce on a sustained basis. That is by no means the situation we face in Canada today. In fact  we have a fairly large margin of spare capacity. Even with the more rapid pace of expansion we experienced in the second half of 1996  we estimate that the level of real GDP was still  on average  about 3 per cent below the level of potential output. This means that the Canadian economy should have room for strong  above-potential rates of growth in output and employment in coming quarters  without a resurgence of inflation. But what about the current rapid rates of money growth? Are they not inflationary? BIS Review 34/1997 - 4 - The 15 per cent year-over-year growth of the M1 aggregate that I mentioned a moment ago is certainly high  and if it persisted for very long  it would not be consistent with preserving low inflation. But there are currently some special factors in the picture which suggest that a temporary period of rapid M1 growth would not be inflationary. These are the recent changes in the nature of business chequing accounts and the need for an adjustment in the stock of money held for transactions purposes  in response to the low levels of interest rates and the move of the economy towards full capacity. Moreover  the recent evolution of the broader monetary aggregates continues to point to low inflation. The important role of inflation-control targets I believe that the role of inflation-control targets in the Bank’s conduct of monetary policy provides additional credibility to this scenario of non-inflationary economic expansion. First of all  with the success we have had in meeting these targets and their growing credibility  inflation expectations appear to have diminished. That makes our job easier these days. In the past  when inflation was high  any signs of demand or price shocks would worsen inflation expectations and add to upward pressures on inflation. Inflation-control targets are also important in dealing with possible changes in the growth potential of the economy. Such changes can result  for example  from additions to the capital stock and increases in productivity. Potential output growth in Canada is expected to increase over the next few years  with the cyclical rebound in productivity and with improvements from ongoing restructuring and investments in technology. There is also a debate going on  particularly in the United States  as to whether there has been a structural change in the way an economy operates. Have more open and competitive international markets effectively increased the capacity of the economy to expand without generating inflation pressures? The Bank tries to take all these considerations into account when forming a view about the inflation outlook. But estimates of potential output are difficult to make  and they have a wide margin of error around them. A monetary policy focused on inflation-control targets ensures that the Bank will not inadvertently make systematic misjudgments over time about how fast the economy can grow. How does that work? An unforeseen improvement in potential will tend to put unexpected downward pressure on inflation. That will encourage the Bank to ease monetary conditions to support a faster expansion in output and employment and to prevent inflation from falling below the bottom of the target range. The reverse would be the case if potential was growing more slowly than we realized and inflation was tending to rise. Moreover  by responding to the trend of inflation relative to the target range  as I have described  monetary policy will also act as an important stabilizer for the economy over the medium term in the face of cyclical fluctuations. The targets effectively call for the Bank to tighten monetary conditions when demand in the economy approaches unsustainable levels  pressing against capacity. But they also call for easier monetary conditions when demand is weak  leaving slack in the economy. Monetary policy targets focused on inflation were initially developed to help reduce persistent high inflation in an orderly manner. But I believe that such targets continue to provide the best framework for the conduct of monetary policy  even at low rates of inflation. BIS Review 34/1997 Concluding comments - 5 - In recent years  Canada has made significant progress in restoring the credibility of its macroeconomic policies and making the adjustments necessary to lay the foundation for a more efficient  prosperous economy in the future. We are now beginning to see the payoffs from this economic transformation. The best contribution the Bank of Canada can make to sustaining these positive trends is to foster a monetary environment of confidence and stability. And that is what we intend to deliver with our commitment to targets for inflation control. BIS Review 34/1997"

Phillips  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Regulatory Relief of the Committee on Banking  Housing and Urban Affairs of the United States on 20/3/97.,"Ms. Phillips discusses the restrictions imposed on bank holding companies by the US Ferderal Reserve Board Testimony of Governor Susan M. Phillips  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Regulatory Relief of the Committee on Banking  Housing and Urban Affairs of the United States on 20/3/97. I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Board’s section 20 firewalls -- that is  the restrictions the Board has imposed on bank holding companies engaged in underwriting and dealing in securities. As the name suggests  the purpose of firewalls is to insulate a bank and its customers from the potential hazards of combining commercial and investment banking. Since last year the Board has been engaged in a comprehensive review of the 28 firewalls it erected in the late 1980s  and the Board has recently proposed to eliminate a majority of those restrictions. This oversight hearing provides a constructive opportunity for comment and analysis of the Board’s proposal. Furthermore  if financial modernization is to move forward  the issue of firewalls will have to be confronted again. I hope that the Board’s review and the public comment process can inform the legislative process as well. Today  I would like to explain why the Board proposed changes to the firewalls. I will also discuss the final changes the Board made last year to the revenue test that the Board uses to determine compliance with section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act  and to firewalls regarding cross-marketing between a bank and a securities affiliate  and officer  director and employee interlocks between two such companies. The Firewalls in Context: Independent Protections for Banks and Consumers Before I begin this discussion  I think it is important to place the firewalls in their historical and regulatory context. Although the firewalls have served an important role  they are not the only protection against the hazards of affiliation of commercial and investment banks. One important protection is the placement of securities activities in a separate subsidiary of the bank holding company  rather than in the bank itself or a subsidiary of the bank. Because non-bank subsidiaries of a bank holding company operating under section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act are affiliates of a bank  they are not under the bank’s control  do not have their profits or losses consolidated with the bank’s  and are less liable to have their creditors recover against the bank. A bank therefore has less incentive to risk its own reputation or expose itself or its customers to loss in order to assist a troubled section 20 affiliate or a failed underwriting by that affiliate. Also  because securities activities are conducted in an affiliate  banks are limited in their ability to fund those activities by sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. These restrictions are vitally important. Section 23A limits the total value of transactions with any one affiliate to 10 percent of the bank’s capital and limits transactions with all affiliates to 20 percent of capital. It also requires that substantial collateral be pledged to the bank for any extension of credit. Section 23B requires that inter-affiliate transactions be at arm’s length and on market terms  and imposes other restrictions designed to limit conflicts of interest. Thus  affiliate status prevents the bank from passing along the federal subsidy inherent in the federal safety net to its section 20 affiliate by extending credit. Regulators could conceivably limit a bank’s ability to use credit to subsidize a direct securities subsidiary of the bank as well  by applying sections 23A and 23B. But the equity investment in the subsidiary BIS Review 34/1997 - 2 - would still be funded from subsidized resources backed by the federal safety net. Even if the investment were deducted from the capital of the bank  the subsidy inherent in the transfer would remain. A second protection is examination of the bank holding company  including the effect of securities activities on insured depository institution subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve as holding company regulator monitors compliance with sections 23A and 23B and other aspects of the relationship between a bank and its section 20 affiliate. In its supervision of bank holding companies  the Board increasingly pays attention to risk management systems and policies that are centralized at the holding company level and govern both the bank and its section 20 affiliate. A final series of protections is the regulatory regime that applies to all broker-dealers  including section 20 subsidiaries. The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 impose registration  capital and disclosure requirements  anti-fraud protections  and other investor-protection measures. These laws  and their enforcement by the Securities and Exchange Commission  address many of the safety and soundness and conflict-of-interest concerns about affiliation of commercial and investment banks. I note that most of these important protections were not in place when the Glass-Steagall Act passed in 1933. Thus  although proponents of high firewalls frequently cite the subtle hazards of affiliation discussed in the legislative history of that Act  the regulatory environment was far different then. I believe that the drafters of the Glass-Steagall Act would have had a very different discussion -- and passed a very different Act -- had today’s statutory and regulatory protections been present in 1933. Not only were these protections largely absent in 1933  some were not even present in 1987 when the Board first erected its firewalls. Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act had not been adopted at the time of the Board’s first section 20 order in 1987. As a result  many of the firewalls overlap the restrictions of section 23B  which as I noted requires inter- affiliate transactions to be at arm’s length and on market terms  but also prohibits a section 20 affiliate from representing that an affiliated bank is responsible for its obligations  and prohibits a bank from purchasing certain products from a section 20 affiliate. Similarly  risk-based capital standards did not exist in 1987  and those standards now require a bank to hold capital against many of the on- and off-balance-sheet exposures it maintains in conjunction with a section 20 affiliate. Finally  the Interagency Statement on Retail Sales of Nondeposit Investment Products was not adopted until 1994. The Interagency Statement includes disclosure and other requirements that are now the primary means by which the federal banking agencies seek to ensure that retail customers are not misled about the nature of non-deposit products they are purchasing on bank premises. The Board’s Review Thus  when the Board last year decided to reexamine the firewalls  we felt it important to do so with a fresh eye  benefitting from our ten years of experience supervising the section 20 affiliates  acknowledging regulatory and legal developments since 1987  and focusing on the relevance of the firewalls in today’s financial markets. As we began to look at the concerns the firewalls were designed to address  we asked two questions. Does the affiliation of a commercial and an investment bank cause safety and soundness or other concerns not present with any other commercial bank affiliation -- concerns not addressed by general bank holding company regulation? Does operation of a broker-dealer within a bank holding company cause BIS Review 34/1997 - 3 - concerns that independent operation does not -- concerns not addressed by broker-dealer regulation? In some areas -- most notably  consumer protection -- we believed that the answer was ""yes."" In most other areas  however  the Board believed  at least pending public comment  that the answer was ""no."" The answers to these questions are important because the firewalls are far from costless. They impose operational inefficiencies on bank holding companies that increase their costs and reduce their competitiveness  and they limit a bank holding company’s ability to market its products in a way that is both most profitable and desired by its customers. As such  the firewalls have served as a significant barrier to entry for small and mid-size bank holding companies because those companies cannot realize sufficient synergies or achieve adequate operating revenues to justify establishing a section 20 subsidiary. The loss is not just to these companies but also to their customers and market competition. Let me now discuss the most important of the firewalls to which the Board has proposed changes. The comment period closed on this proposal last week  and the comments were overwhelmingly favorable. I will not discuss all 28 firewalls but have attached a summary list and their proposed disposition. Restrictions on Funding The Board proposed to eliminate a series of firewalls that constitute a blanket prohibition on a bank’s funding its section 20 affiliate  and to rely instead on the protections of sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The firewalls in question prohibit a bank from extending credit to a section 20 affiliate  purchasing corporate and other non-governmental securities being underwritten by the section 20 affiliate  or purchasing from the section 20 affiliate such securities in which the affiliate makes a market. These firewalls were intended to prevent a bank from assisting a troubled affiliate by lending to it on preferential terms or by bailing out a failed underwriting by purchasing securities that cannot otherwise be sold. Except for the prohibition on purchasing securities during the underwriting period  none of these funding firewalls was applied under the Board’s original 1987 order  but were added in 1989 when the range of permissible securities activities was expanded. Bank subsidiaries of the fourteen companies operating under the 1987 order have therefore been free to  and have in fact  funded their section 20 affiliates subject to sections 23A and 23B. The Board has not encountered problems arising from such funding. If the Board were to eliminate the funding restrictions for the remaining section 20 subsidiaries  sections 23A and 23B would continue to impose quantitative and qualitative restrictions on inter-affiliate transactions. In addition to requiring that the transaction be on market terms  section 23B specifically prohibits a bank from purchasing any security for which a section 20 affiliate is a principal underwriter during the existence of the underwriting or selling syndicate  unless such a purchase has been approved by a majority of the bank’s board of directors who are not officers of any bank or any affiliate. If the purchase is as fiduciary  the purchase must be permitted by the instrument creating the fiduciary relationship  court order  or state law. We believe these are substantial protections  and have proposed to rely on them in place of a firewall. BIS Review 34/1997 - 4 - Prohibitions on a Bank Extending or Enhancing Credit in Support of Underwriting or Dealing by a Section 20 Affiliate Three of the Board’s firewalls restrict the ability of a bank to assist a section 20 affiliate indirectly  by enhancing the marketability of its products or lending to its customers. These firewalls prohibit a bank from extending credit or offering credit enhancements in support of corporate and other non-governmental securities being underwritten by its section 20 affiliate or in which the section 20 affiliate makes a market; extending credit to issuers of securities to repay principal or interest on securities previously underwritten by a section 20 affiliate; or extending credit to customers to purchase securities currently being underwritten by a section 20 affiliate. The firewalls share a common purpose: to prevent a bank from imprudently exposing itself to loss in order to benefit the underwriting or dealing activities of its affiliate. However  as financial intermediation has evolved  corporate customers frequently seek to obtain a variety of funding mechanisms from one source. By prohibiting banks from providing routine credit or credit enhancements in tandem with a section 20 affiliate  these firewalls hamper the ability of bank holding companies to serve as full-service financial services providers. The firewall thereby reduces options for their customers. For example  existing corporate customers of a bank may wish to issue commercial paper or issue debt in some other form. Although the bank may refer the customer to its section 20 affiliate  the bank is prohibited from providing credit enhancements even though it is the institution best suited to perform a credit analysis -- and  with smaller customers  perhaps the only institution willing to do so. As another example  the restriction on lending for repayment of securities causes a bank compliance problems when renewing a company’s revolving line of credit if a section 20 affiliate has underwritten an offering by that company since the credit was first extended. The bank must either recruit other lenders to participate in the renewal or amend the line of credit in order to specify that its purpose does not include repayment of interest or principal on the newly underwritten securities. Notably  even if these firewalls were lifted  a bank would still be required to hold capital against all credit enhancements and credit extended to customers of its section 20 affiliate. Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act would require that such credit and credit enhancements be on an arm’s-length basis. Similarly  the federal anti-tying statute would prohibit a bank from offering discounted credit enhancements on the condition that an issuer obtain investment banking services from a section 20 affiliate. Thus  for example  a bank could not offer such credit enhancements below market prices  or to customers who were poor credit risks  in order to generate underwriting business for a section 20 affiliate. The firewall prohibiting lending to retail customers for securities purchases during the underwriting period addresses one of the most important potential conflicts of interests arising from the affiliation of commercial and investment banking: the possibility that a bank would extend credit at below-market rates in order to induce consumers to purchase securities underwritten by its section 20 affiliate. The concern here is not only safety and soundness but customer protection. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 already prohibits a broker-dealer (including a section 20 affiliate) from extending or arranging for credit to its customers during the underwriting period. Still  we recognize the Act would not apply in the absence of arranging and  unlike the firewall  would not cover loans to purchase a security in which a section 20 affiliate makes a market. Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act  and to some extent section BIS Review 34/1997 - 5 - 23A  would address some of these remaining concerns  but perhaps not all. The Board will be reviewing the comments on this firewall carefully. Capital Requirements The next group of firewalls I will discuss imposes capital requirements on a bank holding company and its section 20 subsidiary. These firewalls require a bank holding company to deduct from its capital any investment in a section 20 subsidiary and most unsecured extensions of credit to a section 20 subsidiary engaged in debt and equity underwriting; they also require the section 20 subsidiary to maintain its own capital in keeping with industry norms. These requirements apply only to section 20 subsidiaries and not to any other nonbank subsidiary of a bank holding company. The Board proposed to eliminate the capital deductions for investments in  or credit extended to  a section 20 subsidiary. The original purpose of the deduction was to ensure that the holding company maintained sufficient resources to support its federally insured depository institutions. In practice  however  the deductions have created regulatory burden without strengthening the capital levels of the insured institutions. The deduction is inconsistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Practices  which require consolidation of subsidiaries for accounting purposes. The deduction therefore has created confusion and imposed costs by requiring bank holding companies to prepare statements on two bases. The deduction does not strengthen the capital of either the bank or its section 20 affiliate  and elimination of the deduction would not create or expose any incentive for a bank holding company to divert necessary capital from a depository institution to a section 20 subsidiary. One of the purposes of the system of prompt corrective action adopted in 1992 is to ensure that a bank holding company maintains the capital of its subsidiary banks. The Board also sought comment on whether it should continue to impose a special capital requirement on section 20 subsidiaries in addition to the SEC’s net capital rules. The purpose of this requirement was to prevent a section 20 subsidiary from being able to leverage itself more than  and gain a competitive advantage over  its independent competitors by trading on the reputation of its affiliated bank. Although the SEC imposes capital requirements on all broker-dealers  these are minimum levels that are far below the industry norm. This capital firewall has proven confusing and controversial  as ""industry norms"" are difficult to determine. Federal Reserve examiners have expected section 20 subsidiaries to maintain capital to cover risk exposure in an amount approximately twice what the SEC requires  but some section 20 subsidiaries have complained that this is more than their competitors maintain. They also argue that whereas SEC capital requirements allow all capital to be concentrated in the broker-dealer and dedicated to meeting capital requirements  a bank holding company must meet capital requirements at the bank and holding company levels as well. Indeed  bank holding company capital is measured on a consolidated basis  and thus includes the capital and assets of the section 20 subsidiary. Therefore  the Board believes it may be unnecessary to impose a separate capital requirement on the bank holding company’s section 20 subsidiary. BIS Review 34/1997 Remaining Restrictions - 6 - Before leaving the Board’s proposal  I should also note which restrictions the Board proposed to retain. The Board proposed to reserve its authority to reimpose the funding  credit extension  and credit enhancement firewalls in the event that an affiliated bank or thrift becomes less than well capitalized and the bank holding company does not promptly restore it to the well-capitalized level. The Board considered proposing to reimpose the firewalls on less than well capitalized banks automatically -- as some recent bills introduced in the Congress would -- but decided against it because a decline in a bank’s capital ratios may be wholly unrelated to the bank’s dealings with its section 20 affiliate. Thus  for example  forcing a bank suffering serious losses on real estate lending to desist from credit enhancements may be unproductive or -- if the business is profitable -- counterproductive. The Board also proposed to retain existing firewalls requiring adequate internal controls and documentation  including a requirement that a bank exercise independent and thorough credit judgment in any transaction involving an affiliate. Although we expect banking organizations to have such internal controls and look for them during examinations  we believe that they are sufficiently important to warrant reinforcement through the operating standards. They are especially important in the section 20 context because of the likelihood that a bank and its section 20 affiliate may be selling similar products to the same customer. Because of the potential for customer confusion as to which products are federally insured  the Board proposed to require a section 20 affiliate to make disclosures to customers similar to those that the Interagency Statement requires of a bank selling nondeposit products on bank premises. The proposal would also continue to prohibit an affiliated bank from knowingly advising a customer to purchase securities underwritten or dealt in by a section 20 affiliate unless it notifies the customer of its affiliate’s role. The proposal also continues to prohibit a bank and its section 20 affiliate from sharing any nonpublic customer information without the customer’s consent. Earlier Board Action on Other Firewalls and the Revenue Limit In addition to describing the Board’s recent proposal  you also asked me to discuss other changes the Board finalized last year: increasing the section 20 revenue limit from 10 percent to 25 percent; allowing cross-marketing between a bank and a section 20 affiliate; permitting employee interlocks between a bank and a section 20 affiliate; and scaling back a restriction on officer and director interlocks. The review that led to changes to the cross-marketing and interlocks firewalls was akin to what the Board recently went through for all the firewalls. The Board acted on these firewalls before the rest because it had previously sought comment on them some years ago and because they were identified by commenters as among the most unduly burdensome of all the firewalls. After reviewing its experience administering these firewalls  the Board decided that they caused inefficiencies that could not be justified by any benefit to safety and soundness  and commenters agreed overwhelmingly. Repeal of the interlocks and cross-marketing restrictions allows increased synergies in the operation of a section 20 subsidiary and its bank affiliates. Persons may be employed by both companies  and the trend toward coordinated management of like business functions can accelerate  with reporting lines running between companies. Companies need not fund dual back offices or trading floors  for example. To the extent that senior bank managers may now oversee related operations at a section 20 affiliate  risk management and safety and soundness may be improved. BIS Review 34/1997 - 7 - Moreover  existing disclosure requirements adequately address concerns about customer confusion arising from increased cross-marketing and employee interlocks. Most notably  the Interagency Statement on Retail Sales of Nondeposit Products states that  prior to the initial sale of a non-deposit product by a bank employee or on bank premises  the customer must receive and acknowledge a written statement that the product being sold is not federally insured  is not a deposit or other obligation of the bank  is not guaranteed by the bank  and is subject to investment risks including loss of principal. Finally  with regard to the revenue limit  section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act prohibits a bank from being affiliated with any company ""engaged principally"" in underwriting and dealing  and the Board was obliged to make a narrow  legal determination of the level of revenue at which a company becomes ""engaged principally."" The Board interpreted the statute to allow 25 percent of total revenue to be derived from underwriting and dealing in bank-ineligible securities. In reviewing the revenue limit  the Board was not deciding what level of underwriting and dealing was consistent with safety and soundness or public policy. If it were  the Board may well have raised the limit to 100 percent  which would have been consistent with the Board’s support of repeal of section 20. I am pleased to report that early indications of the effects of these changes have been favorable. The Board currently has pending three applications to establish a section 20 subsidiary. As we had anticipated  two of these are small to mid-size bank holding companies which may previously have either found it too expensive to fund the dual staffing required by the interlocks restrictions or too difficult to generate sufficient eligible revenue to maintain compliance with a ten percent revenue limit. Furthermore  existing section 20 subsidiaries have indicated that they have been able to rationalize their organization and expand their activities given the added flexibility with respect to both staffing and revenue.

r970403g,1997-04-03,https://www.bis.org/review/r970403g.pdf,Mr. Greenspan highlights some key aspects of the current economic situation in the United States (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  20 Mar 97),Testimony of the Chairman of the Board of the US Federal Reserve System  Mr. Alan Greenspan  before the Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress on 20/3/97.,Mr. Greenspan highlights some key aspects of the current economic situation in the United States Testimony of the Chairman of the Board of the US Federal Reserve System  Mr. Alan Greenspan  before the Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress on 20/3/97. Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee  I am pleased to appear here today. Last month  the Federal Reserve Board submitted its semiannual report on monetary policy to the Congress. That report and my accompanying testimony covered in detail our assessment of the outlook for the U.S. economy. This morning  I would like to highlight some of the key aspects of the current economic situation. As I told the Congress last month  the performance of the U.S. economy remains quite favorable. Real GDP growth picked up to more than 3 percent over the four quarters of 1996. Moreover  recently released data suggest that activity has retained a great deal of vigor in early 1997. In addition  nominal hourly wages and salaries have risen faster than prices over the past several quarters  meaning that workers have reaped some of the benefits of rising productivity and thus gained ground in real terms. Outside the food and energy sectors  increases in consumer prices have actually continued to edge lower  with core CPI inflation of only 2½ percent over the past twelve months. The low inflation of the past year is both a symptom and a cause of the good economy. It is symptomatic of the balance and solidity of the expansion and the evident absence of major strains on resources. At the same time  continued low levels of inflation and inflation expectations have been a key support for healthy economic performance. They have helped to create a financial and economic environment conducive to strong capital spending and longer-range planning generally  and so to sustained economic expansion. These types of results are why we stressed in our monetary policy testimony the importance of acting promptly -- ideally pre-emptively -- to keep inflation low over the intermediate term and to promote price stability over time. For some  the benign inflation outcome of the past year might be considered surprising  as resource utilization rates -- particularly of labor -- have been in the neighborhood of those that historically have been associated with building inflation pressures. To be sure  nominal hourly labor compensation  especially its wage component  accelerated in 1996. But the rate of pay increase still was markedly less than historical relationships with labor market conditions would have predicted. Atypical restraint on compensation increases has been evident for a few years now. Almost certainly  it reflects a number of factors  including the sharp deceleration in health care costs and the heightened pressure on firms and workers in industries that compete internationally. Domestic deregulation has also intensified the competitive forces in some industries. But  as I outlined in some detail in testimony last month  I believe that job insecurity has played the dominant role. For example  in 1991  at the bottom of the recession  a survey of workers at large firms by International Survey Research Corporation indicated that 25 percent feared being laid off. In 1996  despite the sharply lower unemployment rate and the tighter labor market  the same survey organization found that 46 percent were fearful of a job layoff. Whatever the reasons for its persistence  job insecurity cannot suppress wage growth indefinitely. Clearly  there is a limit to how long workers will remain willing to accept smaller increases in living standards in exchange for additional job security. Even if real wages were to remain permanently on a lower upward track than otherwise as a result of the greater BIS Review 34/1997 - 2 - sense of insecurity  the rate of change of wages would revert at some point to a normal relationship with price inflation. The unknown is when a more normal pattern will resume. Indeed  the labor markets bear especially careful watching for signs that such a process is under way. So far this year  the demand for labor has stayed strong. Payroll employment grew briskly in January and February  and the unemployment rate remained around 5¼ percent -- roughly matching the low of the last cyclical upswing  in the late 1980s. Also  initial claims for unemployment insurance remained low into March. In addition  the percentage of households telling the Conference Board that jobs are plentiful has risen sharply of late  which suggests that workers may be growing more confident about the job situation. Finally  wages rose faster in 1996 than in 1995 by most measures -- in fact  the acceleration was quite sizable by some measures. This  too  raises questions about whether the transitional period of unusually slow wage gains may be drawing to a close. In any event  further increases in labor utilization rates would heighten the risk of additional upward pressure on wage costs  and ultimately prices. To be sure  the pickup in wage gains to date has not shown through to underlying price inflation. Increases in the core CPI  as well as in several other broad measures of prices  have stayed subdued or even edged off further of late. As best I can judge  faster productivity growth last year offset the pressure from rising compensation gains on labor costs per unit of output. And non-labor costs  which are roughly a quarter of total consolidated costs of the nonfinancial corporate sector  were little changed in 1996. Owing in part to this subdued behavior of unit costs  profits and rates of return on capital have risen to high levels. As a consequence  a substantial number of businesses apparently believe that  were they to raise prices to boost profits further  competitors with already ample profit margins would not follow suit; instead  they would use the occasion to capture a greater market share. This interplay is doubtless a significant factor in the evident loss of pricing power in American business. Intensifying global competition may also be limiting the ability of domestic firms to hike prices as well as wages. Competitive pressures here and abroad should continue to act as a restraint on inflation in the months ahead. In addition  crude oil prices have largely retraced last year’s run-up  and  with the worldwide supply of oil having moved up relative to demand  futures markets project stable prices over the near term. Food prices should also rise less rapidly than they did in 1996 as some of last year’s supply limitations ease. Nonetheless  the trends in the core CPI and in broader price measures are likely to come under pressure from a continued tight labor market  whose influence on costs will be augmented by the scheduled increase in the minimum wage later in the year. And  with considerable health-care savings already having been realized  larger increases in fringe benefits could put upward pressure on overall compensation. Moreover  although non-oil import prices should remain subdued in 1997 as the sharp rise in the dollar over the past year-and-a-half continues to feed through to domestic prices  their damping effects on U.S. inflation probably will not be as great as in 1996. The lagged effects of the increase in the exchange value of the dollar will also likely restrain real U.S. net exports this year. In addition  declines in real federal government purchases should exert a modest degree of restraint on overall demand  and residential construction will probably not repeat the gains of 1996. On the other hand  financial conditions overall remain supportive to the real economy  and creditworthy borrowers are finding funding to be readily available from intermediaries and in the securities markets. Moreover  we do not BIS Review 34/1997 - 3 - see evidence of widespread imbalances either in business inventories or in stocks of capital equipment and consumer durables that would lead to a substantial cutback in spending. The trends in consumer spending on items other than durables also look solid. Retail sales posted robust gains in January and February  and  according to various surveys  sentiment is decidedly upbeat. Moreover  consumers have enjoyed healthy increases in their real incomes over the past couple of years  along with the extraordinary stock-market driven rise in their financial wealth. Should the higher wealth be sustained  it could provide important support to consumption in 1997. But  looking at the data through 1996  the surging stock market does not seem to have imparted as big a boost to spending as past relationships would have predicted. The lack of a more substantial wealth effect is especially surprising because we have also seen a noticeable widening in the ownership of stocks over the past several years. Indeed  the Federal Reserve’s recently released Survey of Consumer Finances suggests that of the total value of all families’ holdings of publicly traded stocks and mutual funds  the share held by those with incomes below $100 000 (in 1995 dollars) rose from 32 percent in 1989 to 46 percent in 1995. It is possible  however  that the wealth effect is being offset by other factors. In particular  families may be reluctant to spend their added wealth because they see a greater need to keep it to support spending in retirement. Many have expressed heightened concern about their financial security in old age  in part because of growing skepticism about the viability of the Social Security system. This concern has reportedly led to stepped-up saving for retirement. The sharp increase in debt burdens in recent years may also be constraining spending by some families. Indeed  although our consumer survey showed that debt usage rose between 1992 and 1995 for almost all income groups  changes in financial conditions were not uniform across families. Notably  the median ratio of debt payments to income for families with debt -- a useful measure of the typical debt burden -- held steady or declined for families with incomes of at least $50 000  but it rose for those with incomes below $50 000. We don’t know whether these latter families took on the additional debt because they perceived brighter future income prospects  or simply to accelerate purchases they would have made later. Nonetheless  these families are probably the most vulnerable to disruptions in income  and the rise in their debt burdens is likely to make both borrowers and lenders a bit more cautious as we move forward. Both household and business balance sheets have expanded at a pace considerably faster than income and product flows over the past decade. Accordingly  any percentage change in assets or liabilities has a greater effect on economic growth than it used to. However  identifying such influences in the aggregate data is not always easy. At present  the difficulty is compounded by concern that the currently published national statistics may not provide an accurate reading of the trends in recent years  especially for productivity. In any event  other data suggest that wealth and debt effects may be exerting a measurable influence on the consumption and saving decisions of different segments of the population. According to the Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics  saving out of current income by families in the upper-income quintile evidently has declined in recent years. At the same time  Federal Reserve estimates suggest that the use of credit for purchases has leveled off after a sharp run-up from 1993 to 1996  perhaps because some families are becoming debt constrained and  as a result  are curtailing their spending. BIS Review 34/1997 - 4 - The Federal Reserve  of course  will be weighing these and other influences as it makes future policy decisions. Demand has been growing quite strongly in recent months  and the FOMC  at its meeting next week  will have to judge whether that pace of expansion will be maintained  and  if so  whether it will continue to be met by solid productivity growth  as it apparently has been -- official figures to the contrary notwithstanding. Alternatively  if strong demand is expected to persist  and does not seem likely to be matched by productivity improvement  the FOMC will have to decide whether increased pressures on supply will eventually produce the types of inflationary imbalances that  if not addressed early  will undermine the long expansion. Should we choose to alter monetary policy  we know from past experience that  although the financial markets may respond immediately  the main effects on inflationary pressures may not be felt until late this year and in 1998. Because forecasts that far out are highly uncertain  we rarely think in terms of a single outlook. Rather  we endeavor to assess the likely consequences of our decisions in terms of a reasonable range of possible outcomes. Part of our evaluation is to judge not only the benefits that are likely to result from appropriate policy  but also the costs should we be wrong. In any action -- including leaving policy unchanged -- we seek to assure ourselves that the expected benefits are large enough to risk the cost of a mistake. In closing  I would like to note that the current economic expansion is now entering its seventh year. That makes it already a long upswing by historical standards. And yet  looking ahead  the prospects for sustaining the expansion are quite favorable. The flexibility of our market system and the vibrancy of our private sector remain examples for the whole world to emulate. We will endeavor to do our part by continuing to foster a monetary framework under which our citizens can prosper to the fullest possible extent. BIS Review 34/1997

Central bankers are famous for their obsessive concern about credibility and consistency. By that token  I should be drummed out of the club I have only recently joined. Because when the Governor stood here a little over a year ago  he assured the audience that he was delivering the fourth and last in the series of LSE Bank of England lectures. But  in keeping with the usual practice of successful television shows  I am here tonight to open a new series. The LSE seemed to think you would prefer that to filling the schedule hereafter with repeats. This new series picks up where the last left off. In 1996 the Governor noted there is nowadays a broad consensus that the raison d’être of central banks everywhere is the pursuit of monetary and financial stability; but he observed that once you go beyond that level of generality  each central bank is unique - in terms of its constitutional position  the range of its activities  its size  structure and organisation. Many of these differences are the result of history. The question I plan to address tonight is whether contemporary forces are eroding these distinctions between central banks and pushing them towards some common model. I shall confine myself largely to what is happening in Europe. The increasing globalisation of financial markets is one pressure for change across the world. But in western Europe  the Maastricht Treaty and the preparations for Economic and Monetary Union are requiring central banks to review their statutes and to align their operating procedures. But I also want to talk about the central banks of Eastern Europe. They are feeling similar pressures - several hope that their countries will accede to the European Union within five years or so - but their origins are very different. In 1989 most of the state banks of central and eastern Europe had little understanding of the rôle of a central bank in a market economy. Since then they have had rapidly to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to tackle acute inflationary pressures while many of their leading banks were effectively bankrupt. At the Bank of England  we have been actively involved in helping them by drawing on our own experience as central bankers  adapting the lessons we have ourselves learned over the years to the unique circumstances of the transition economies. Much of this effort has been channelled through our Centre for Central Banking Studies which we established in 1990 to provide technical assistance and training to other central banks. We have given advice principally on core functions such as monetary policy and operations  the development of money markets and payment systems  the management of government debt  and banking supervision; but our help has also been sought in some less obvious matters such as the physical security of central bank buildings and their contents. The assistance is provided through our experts visiting other central banks and by their staff coming on study visits to London  as well as through seminars and workshops here and abroad. In the earlier years most of these events were essentially training courses. But increasingly the participants from many countries are able to contribute more themselves to the discussion so that they are now learning not only from our own experience as central bankers  BIS Review 33/1997 - 2 - but also from each other. And in some instances  their experience may well hold lessons for us. Since 1990 over 4 000 staff of other central banks - two thirds of them from the transition economies - have participated in these various events. The work of the Centre for Central Banking Studies  and the other inter-bank links we maintain (notably between supervisors) give us  I believe  a privileged perspective on the development of central banking across Europe. The analysis below - particularly the Eastern European sections - is very largely the work of Lionel Price  the Centre’s Director  and his staff. History is important In a study1 published by the LSE’s Financial Markets Group last year  Rosa Maria Lastra concludes that central banks are not “natural products” but products of history. She emphasises the special relationships whereby central banks have been consciously awarded privileges by governments  and have been expected to provide certain services and functions in return. This may seem a dubious process  like selling monopolies. But central banking  she kindly says  is not an “evil”: that comes as a relief to some of us. Though a product of history  and a creature favoured by the state  a central bank may serve useful economic goals in the pursuit of stable money and sound banking. While most of their functions could be fulfilled by a different public or private institution  central banks are today typically seen as convenient instruments for the conduct of both monetary policy and banking supervision. I agree with Dr Lastra’s conclusions. Moreover  central banks’ differing historical origins influence not only the tasks they carry out today  but also the way in which they think and operate. The Bank of England was established to lend money to the government; and though the Maastricht Treaty now prohibits any buying of British government debt by the Bank of England in the primary market  the Bank still manages government funding operations in an essentially agency capacity (and the present Governor first came to public prominence in this area!). By contrast  the origin of the Federal Reserve Banks in the USA lay in the provision of a reliable nation-wide payment and depository system  and that remains a central activity. While some banking supervision is conducted by the Fed  that is largely the remit of (myriad) other institutions (the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  banking regulators in each separate state and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation). The Bundesbank was set up against a background of the need to restore and maintain a stable currency  and this  together with the concomitant political independence  remain at the heart of its rôle. An early strong belief in the “real bills” doctrine still influences the Bundesbank’s views on appropriate collateral for central bank operations with the market  and justifies its large branch network and staff. The Banque de France has retained more retail banking than most other modern central banks  maintaining branches in every French département (a network it has found difficult to slim down in face of local and trades union opposition). It also makes use of its branches in compiling a centrale des risques  a register of commercial bank lending  and in keeping track of the million or so individuals who have drawn bad cheques! The Bank of Japan is more of a medley. Its rôle model when it was established in 1882 was  you may be surprised to hear  the Banque Nationale de Belgique  though some aspects of English banking practice were also adopted. Legislation in 1942 followed the then German model  particularly in making the Bank of Japan subservient to the Ministry of Finance; and after the war  there was American influence. 1 Rosa Maria Lastra  “Central Banking and Banking Regulation”  LSE Financial Markets Group  1996  page 285. BIS Review 33/1997 - 3 - In Figures 1 and 2  I have attempted to capture some of the distinctions between these leading central banks. (Because I am concentrating on distinctions  I have omitted common tasks - such as the issuance of banknotes and acting as banker for government - which are carried out by virtually all central banks.) Figure 1 shows the UK’s “scores” in five areas  while Figure 2 adds in  by way of comparison  the other G5 countries. Mapping the distinctions is not an easy task. For instance  though in Germany a government office is responsible for banking supervision  it is central bank staff who undertake much of the day-to-day work of monitoring individual banks. In France  supervision is the responsibility of the Commission Bancaire  but its secretariat is effectively part of the Banque de France  and the Governor chairs it. And in Japan  the central bank closely monitors the large banks  though the responsibility for supervision formally rests with the finance ministry. Furthermore  the extent of a country’s total financial regulatory effort encompassed by the term ‘banking supervision’ varies - most British banks have set up separate subsidiaries for their trading activity  regulated by securities regulators (though the responsibility for consolidated supervision remains with the Bank of England); by contrast  European banks tend to retain trading within the banking entity. It is also not always apparent whether the central bank is in practice free to set interest rates to achieve the monetary policy objectives which derive from its own statutes or from objectives set by government. The Bundesbank clearly has that freedom; and the other EU member states have been legislating in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty to give their central banks independence in the field of monetary policy. In Britain  even though there have been very welcome improvements in the transparency of monetary policy formulation since 1992  decisions on interest rates remain clearly with the Chancellor of the Exchequer though now within a clear inflation target framework. In Japan the position is under review. The ultimate authority on interest rates has rested legally with the Minister of Finance  though according to Goodhart  Capie and Schnadt “it is widely understood that it would be extraordinary if the government resorted to these provisions  and they have never been enacted”.2 The same authors conclude that the Bank of Japan “has thus enjoyed independence in practice”. What is harder to judge is the extent to which the Bank of Japan’s decisions may have been influenced at times by recognition of the latent ministerial powers. Notwithstanding those nuances  what can be seen from Figure 2 is that the Bank of England is quite distinctive amongst the five leading industrial countries. We have: the least independence in setting interest rates; the most comprehensive responsibility for banking supervision (though some other banks have broader financial regulatory responsibilities); the greatest role in managing government debt - we provide substantial policy input as well as actually handling auctions as issuing agent for the Treasury; the smallest branch network - we have consciously reduced the scope of our private banking activities in recent years (focusing on areas of 2 Charles Goodhart  Forrest Capie and Norbert Schnadt  “The development of central banking” in The future of central banking  the tercentenary symposium of the Bank of England  Cambridge 1994  page 169. BIS Review 33/1997 - 4 - comparative advantage as a public sector institution) and are now also leaving note distribution to be handled largely by the private banks; a comparatively limited but increasing role in the operation of payment and settlement systems - typically  the Bank of England participates in payments systems which are run by the private sector  and has only involved itself in the establishment and operation of settlement systems when the private sector has not itself succeeded in doing so. Recently  however  the introduction of CREST and RTGS  and the European work on TARGET  has expanded on our work considerably. These maps cannot easily convey a sense of the dynamics of change in central banking. Central banks are evolving creatures  which respond to political and economic forces around them. One unusually powerful force  which will change their environment fundamentally  is EMU. But before considering its impact  I would like to consider the state of play in the rest of (non-EU) Europe  where exciting transformations of a different kind have occurred in the last decade. Turning socialist state banks into central banks The central banks of the formerly planned economies of central and eastern Europe have generally developed important responsibilities in each of my five areas (Figure 3). The old state banks have been transformed to fill the vacuum left by the dissolution of the mechanisms and institutions of a planned economy. Most had extensive branch networks and already operated rudimentary payment systems - though transfers often relied on correspondent banking relationships and slow and unreliable postal systems. But under the old regime there was little if any requirement for the other functions - setting interest rates  managing government debt  and supervising banks. Instead the main roles of the state banks had been the provision of banknotes; and making the financial transfers between state enterprises inherent in the central economic plans. The perceived importance of cash  and the bookkeeping culture  still influence to varying degrees their successor institutions. But these banks have been hit by a series of powerful shocks. (i) Monetary policy The first is the shift from centralised control of the economy to a market-based system. Instead of directing money to meet enterprises’ deficits - a job which required a large branch network and hordes of bureaucrats - the aim is to influence the behaviour of the economy by using indirect instruments of monetary policy to guide interest rates and the exchange rate  and to conduct the prudential supervision of the new commercial banks. But many of the bureaucrats find it difficult to work out which bits of information they need and how often  and prefer instead to demand a substantial volume of data without prioritisation. Some of the staff of eastern European central banks  used to passing on raw data which can be checked against enterprises’ targets  find it difficult to analyse information with the aim of learning something about the behaviour of markets  consumers or firms. The simple questions  “Why are we doing this?”  “What does this mean?” can be too hard to ask. New goals  however well-enshrined in the constitution and law  do not change culture overnight. BIS Review 33/1997 - 5 - The second culture shock has been the move from a monobank to a two-tier banking system. The old system had two separate monetary circuits - one for cash (used mainly by individuals) and the other in transfers between bank accounts (used by enterprises). One of the early tasks of western advisers was to try to convince the would-be central bankers in the east that monetary policy was not just a matter of regulating the supply of banknotes. And many of the same people found it difficult to accept that the provision of credit by a central bank - whether to government or to enterprises - is likely to have inflationary consequences. When the basic problem is a shortage of national savings (often because the state is pre-empting private savings through its budget deficit and off-budgetary spending)  the central bank cannot magically create extra real resources by relaxing monetary policy. Were it so  we central bankers would be even more popular people than we are now. The response of the eastern European and CIS central banks to their new goals has been tempered by a number of factors: how long the old culture had prevailed; how democratic the new regime is (independent central banks do not get on well with autocracies); the size of the country; the availability of foreign currency to the government  whether from export revenues (oil or gas) or loans from international financial institutions; and in the case of the ten (yes  ten!) applicants from the region to join the EU  how quickly they believe they need to move into line. The differences between these central banks are perhaps most marked in relation to monetary policy and financial relations with the government. The westernmost of the transition countries have typically liberalised the most  adopting policies and structures which are already very close to those of their EU neighbours; while  further East  reform and market-based operations are still viewed with some scepticism (everyone of course pays lip service to the benefits of and need for market reform and structural adjustment  but many do not in their hearts believe it will work for them)  and the markets that have been introduced are subjected to discretionary administrative controls - particularly in crises. Partly because of the influence of the IMF and other western advisers as well as  in the case of EU applicants  the need to harmonise with EU law and practice  the legislation governing the new central banks usually follows a common model  giving them autonomy to pursue an objective of monetary stability. What is interesting is that the aspects of monetary control whose merits we debate in the west - the degree of independence of the central bank  inflation targets versus monetary targets  fixed or floating exchange rates - have in terms of results been of secondary importance to the understanding and acceptance of the case for reform on the part of the public  parliament and government. There is little benefit to a central bank BIS Review 33/1997 - 6 - being independent of government if the parliament is able to force it to grant subsidised credits to favoured sectors. And independence counts for little if the government persists in running a deficit while non-monetary means to finance it have yet to be developed. If we look at five of the central European countries where reform is most advanced - the Czech and Slovak Republics  Slovenia  Hungary and Poland - the first two have succeeded in bringing annual inflation down to single figures  while inflation in Hungary and Poland is just below 20%. All except Hungary monitor an intermediate monetary target  but these targets have proved unreliable friends in the transitional economies generally. It has been far from easy to predict the velocity of money when the economic and financial structure is in turmoil. The more important success factor appears to be exchange rate policy. The Czechs and Slovaks have been able to hold their exchange rates fixed against a Deutsche Mark/US dollar basket. This has not been sufficient to deliver the inflation rates of 1-3 % seen in Germany and the United States  as the transition economies are experiencing faster rates of growth in productivity in tradables; they need to permit their currencies to appreciate if they are to lower their inflation rates further. But their fixed exchange rates have cemented and enhanced the credibility of the sound monetary and budgetary policies being followed. Yet fixing the exchange rate is not the only route to lowering inflation. Slovenia has succeeded with a managed float  though a key factor has been its willingness to keep their real exchange rate relatively high. In contrast  Hungary and Poland have tried to prevent the inevitable real appreciation of their currencies by continually depreciating their nominal exchange rates in reflection of their higher rates of inflation. Polish policy became less accommodating last year  and Hungary may be set to follow. Of course  an exchange rate peg is far more credible if a country has sizeable foreign exchange reserves. The Baltic states were fortunate in this respect as they regained access to the gold held by their central banks in London and Paris before the War; and Estonia and Lithuania have gone as far as to fix their exchange rates rigidly in a currency board system which removes discretion from monetary policy. (Note that these countries too are experiencing real appreciation: annual inflation is nearly 15% despite their fixed exchange rates.) The IMF is now encouraging Bulgaria to follow suit and adopt a currency board as the central bank there has not been able to impose a sufficiently tight monetary policy in the face of lack of progress on other aspects of reform. But the currency board can only succeed as part of a comprehensive package of fiscal and structural measures. The strict monetary policy rules of a currency board can work well if fiscal policy is highly responsible - or will become so as a result of the currency board; if not  it may put severe strains on the banking system  as has been the case in the Baltic states. (ii) Banking supervision This potential conflict between monetary policy and maintaining the stability of the banking system is not one which has greatly troubled most western industrial countries in recent years. But in some transition economies  such conflicts have been real. In most  the problem has not been so much to maintain the stability of the banking system as to create a robust banking system from a number of often insolvent state-owned banks spun off from the old monobank  together with newly created commercial banks whose behaviour has frequently been far from prudent. BIS Review 33/1997 - 7 - In contrast to the diverse arrangements in the west  banking supervision in transition economies is nearly always the responsibility of the central bank (although in some cases the Ministry of Finance is also involved in the licensing of banks). An exception is Hungary  where supervisory responsibilities have in large measure been transferred to the State Banking Supervision Office: the central bank is nominally responsible only for monitoring banks’ liquidity and foreign exchange positions  although in practice its role extends rather more widely. In most of the countries - especially in those with hopes of acceding soon to the EU - banking legislation approximating to western standards is (or is about to be) in place. But in practice  banking supervision has proved a difficult topic to master. Whereas monetary policy requires a highly trained but small cadre of economists in the head office of the central bank  large numbers of supervisors are needed  often spread across the country  to deal with a multitude of new banks with poor quality accounts. And the skills of assessing risk and the quality of management have not always come easily to staff from a bookkeeping background whose instincts are to tick boxes rather than make judgements. Staff who have acquired the skills needed are frequently enticed away to work for commercial banks at higher salaries. (iii) Managing government debt Another field in which central and eastern European central banks are generally more heavily involved than their western counterparts is in the management of government debt. (Hungary  where there is a separate debt office under the Ministry of Finance  broadly on the Irish model  is again an exception.) Under the old regimes governments relied on their state banks for finance  but the new statutes of the central banks - usually following an IMF model - limit the provision of finance to government. Ceilings are mostly around 5% of government revenues  though in Estonia and Lithuania they are zero. With monetary financing restricted  new methods of financing governments have had to be developed and nearly all the central banks have taken a leading part in this process. Even where the government’s own financing needs have been small  as in the Czech Republic  central banks have been keen to establish markets in short-term paper in which they can conduct monetary operations. Several of them have issued their own bills for this purpose  particularly where in the early years the finance ministry was reluctant to issue government paper. Whether the market being developed is in government  central bank or private paper  the central banks have had to strike a difficult balance in deciding how frequently to intervene in the markets. In the absence of intervention  a market can remain illiquid and unused. But if the central bank intervenes too much and holds prices too steady  then private market-makers will not develop. This dilemma is not unique to transition countries. Similar dilemmas arise elsewhere  and some western central banks still sometimes play a role  if only a marginal one  in balancing supply and demand in the domestic securities and foreign exchange markets. (iv) Payment and settlement systems One area of activity in which the new central banks do mirror the diversity of their western counterparts is in responsibility for payment and settlement systems. Of the nine central banks in central and eastern Europe  five operate the main clearing system themselves. In the other four countries the position is roughly as it is here  with the central bank participating BIS Review 33/1997 - 8 - in  and providing final settlement for  a privately owned clearing system. In Russia the central bank has been slow to develop its own payment system  and commercial banks have been putting parallel mechanisms in place. In the west  technological developments and a desire to reduce systemic risks have been drawing central banks like ourselves into greater involvement in payment and settlement services  especially in the provision of real-time gross settlement. No doubt the central banks in the transition economies will feel the same pressures before long. (v) Branch networks On the last of my five metrics of central bank functions - the size of the branch network (which I use as a convenient proxy for the extent of their involvement in straight banking activities and in note distribution) - the transition central banks occupy an intermediate position. The extensive branch networks of the monobanks went largely to the savings banks  and in some case they have been turned into commercial banks. The result has been surprisingly consistent across central and eastern Europe  with one branch remaining for every ½ - 1 million people (except for the Bank of Estonia which has no branches  a scrupulous qualification). Some of the new central banks are even now questioning  as we have done  whether they need branches - as distinct from regional agencies - at all. Following the setting up of a State Treasury  the Hungarian central bank has closed more than half its branches. Obviously the political structure and geography of the country is material. In the USA and Germany  the maintenance of a branch network reflects the federal structure of the state. In Russia  a federal state with a very large geographical area  the Central Bank has sixty territorial branches and nineteen regional banks - apparently rather modest numbers for a country with some 150 million people spread across ten time zones. But in addition the CBR in 1994 ran 1 356 cash and settlement centres  13 banking schools  and 30 “other organisations”. To run this empire the bank employed over 52 000 staff  having created over 7 000 additional posts in the previous two years to conduct its various new functions. Central bank staffing and costs All this shows that  even though all European central banks face similar pressures  the solutions remain quite diverse. That is reflected in relative costs. Comparable data are hard to come by  but the Bank of Russia appears to have more staff per head of population than any other. The People’s Bank of China is larger  employing some 150 000 people (but only 1 000 in head office where policy is centralised)  but considering the PBoC’s continuing role as banker to the state-owned enterprises that looks small in relation to a population of 1.2 billion. Other very large central banks are the Reserve Bank of India with 32 000 staff and the US Federal Reserve System with 25 000. One would expect the number of staff employed by a central bank to depend not just on the population of the country (and in this there should be some economies of scale) but also on the range of tasks it has and how efficiently it conducts them. At the Bank of England we take a lot of interest in comparative efficiency: we are determined to be a value for money central bank  and benchmark ourselves against others wherever possible. Some of the data we use are confidential: central banks are more candid with each other in private than they are in public. But there are a few published measures. A study in 1995 by Fry  Goodhart and BIS Review 33/1997 - 9 - Almeida3 of a sample of 30 central banks  largely from developing countries  tested twelve variables as possible explanations of non-supervisory staff numbers. Most significant was a country’s population  with an elasticity of one half  confirming substantial economies of scale across the sample countries. There were positive relationships with real per capita income (central banking appears to be a luxury good!)  the number of branches  and the use of exchange controls (both of which would increase staff needs). Perhaps surprisingly the more independent central banks seemed to employ fewer staff (perhaps that could be the basis of an accommodation with Gordon Brown!). Amongst the variables which showed no relationship was the inflation rate (though there could be a simultaneity problem here). Figure 4 shows the numbers of staff employed two or three years ago by the central banks of various industrial countries and some of the transition economies. There is clearly the expected positive relationship with population  but the ratio varies hugely: a central bank on the highest of the three parallel lines has ten times the staff per million population as one on the lowest line. The extent of this dispersion is more apparent in Figure 5 which shows the number of staff per million population for the large countries. With only around 3 500 people - down by more than 50% over the last twenty years and still falling fast - the Bank of England itself is one of the most modestly staffed in relation to its population. In contrast to the significant results found by Fry et al. from their sample of developing countries  regression analysis on the industrial country data shows only weak evidence of small economies of scale. Nor did other variables tested on industrial countries yield any significant results. As for the transition economies  their staff numbers generally conform to those in industrial countries with similar populations. The exception is the Bank of Russia  whose staff looks abnormally large. Some of these central banks are still growing as they seek to carry out their new functions; but one or two  like the National Bank of Hungary  are already reviewing what they are doing and how they do it  and are slimming down. By the end of this year  they expect to have 40% fewer staff than two years ago. These variations in staff numbers naturally have an impact on the running costs of central banks  but relative salary levels and non-staff costs are obviously also important. Figure 6 is based on data for 1992  taken from central banks’ Annual Reports. The vertical axis shows the gross operating costs of each central bank as a percentage of GDP. The horizontal axis shows population. For a swathe of countries across the bottom of the chart - from New Zealand at 0.06% through Sweden  Denmark  Switzerland  the Netherlands and Australia (0.04 - 0.05%) to Britain (0.037%) and Canada and the United States at 0.03% - there may be some scale effect  but several European countries do not fit this model at all. The central banks of Italy and France - countries with the same population as the UK - then cost 5 and 3.5 times more than us  and the picture has changed little since. Some of the differences may be down to national culture  but another factor may be that the funds at the disposal of the different central banks vary widely. In particular  I suspect that some of our relative cheapness may be attributable to the Bank Charter Act of 1844  since which time the seignorage on our banknote issue has been passed directly and immediately to the government. This is not generally the case abroad  at least in European countries - west or east - where profits  a fraction of seignorage  are passed only periodically to government. (The UK is also unusual in that foreign exchange reserves  and any profits earned on them  belong to the government rather than to the central bank  although the Bank of England does of course have responsibility for managing the reserves). European integration 3 Maxwell Fry  Charles Goodhart and Alvero Almeida  Central Banking in developing countries  Routledge  1996  pages 97-99. BIS Review 33/1997 - 10 - Looking at the European continent as a whole  it is interesting that  whereas the common history of central and eastern European countries over the last half century has produced broadly similar central banks in the different countries - at least in those which are contemplating accession to the European Union - the central banks of the existing member states are a disparate bunch. What remains to be seen is how far the advent of Economic and Monetary Union may induce more homogeneity and  indeed  reduce costs. It ought to be the case  after all  that one monetary policy is cheaper to administer than 15  or 25. The European Central Bank will appear a much more concentrated creature than the central banks we have been looking at. It will be responsible for the issuance of euro banknotes (known to the cognoscenti as bridging finance) but beyond this  in terms of the diagram I have been using  the ECB will be almost uni-dimensional (figure 7). According to the Maastricht Treaty its independence in setting interest rates will be unparalleled. But it will not supervise banks (not even as an agent) and it will not manage government debt. It is agreed that those functions will remain firmly with the national central banks (or other relevant agencies). In payment systems the ECB will be responsible for only the tip of the iceberg  that is TARGET  the system linking the various national payment systems of EU member states. This narrow focus is no accident: the ECB’s task is to maintain monetary stability  and its design reflects that. The European System of Central Banks  collectively  will do much more than that  of course. Discussions between EU central banks on how monetary policy will operate within the EMU are well advanced  and the European Monetary Institute published a report in January setting out what is agreed and what remains to be decided. In principle  the creation of the ECB in 1998 (in advance of Stage III) or thereafter need not affect the other activities of EU central banks  whether they are in or out of the euro-area  provided they do not conflict with the ECB’s achievement of monetary stability. But it seems very likely that some of the activities of the national central banks  and especially those who are members of the euro-area  will change character as EMU develops (if it does). That is partly because questions will undoubtedly be asked about costs. One American commentator has recently pointed out that the total cost of the US Federal Reserve system today is well under a third of the total costs of EU central banks. On that issue  as I have demonstrated  I believe we at the Bank of England have a good story to tell. But the introduction of the euro would also have major implications for payments systems and financial markets generally  which are bound to push national central banks closer together. At the same time  functions further from the core of central banking  and especially those which could be performed as well or better by the private sector  are likely to move out of the central banks. As for monetary policy  if you will permit me one last quotation  one which should appeal to this audience  Alex Cukierman said in his extensive study of central banking  “A governor who is backed by an absolutely and relatively strong research department carries BIS Review 33/1997 - 11 - more weight vis-à-vis the Treasury and other branches of government”.4 The same will be true within the European System of Central Banks  so I envisage national central banks keeping their capacity to analyse the state of their domestic economy. However  it ought to be possible  over time  for the ins to capture some economies of scale  and to develop centres of excellence in central banks around the Union  with expertise in particular areas of work. It is unlikely to make sense to have 15 (and certainly not 25) teams of economists analysing the causes of changes in the velocity of euroM4. But I do not wish to give the impression that EMU  even if it comes about on something roughly approaching the current timetable  will be the ‘end of history’ as far as European central banking is concerned. I suspect that central banks in Europe will continue to display great diversity  and will continue to evolve in different directions  and at different speeds  in response to the characteristics of their local habitat. What is important is that they should be responsive  learning and self-critical organisations  ready to react quickly to changing circumstances. They must also  in my view  display their accountability  perhaps more so than in the past. With the greater responsibilities which European central banks  East and West  have assumed in recent years  comes a greater need to explain the basis on which decisions are made  and to account for the resources deployed in making those decisions. That accountability runs partly to the Treasury  who exercise financial discipline over us  partly to Parliament - whose growing interest in our affairs we welcome - and partly to the broader community. I see this series of lectures fitting within that context  and have been pleased this evening to have the opportunity to set out some more recent reflections  from within the Bank  on the way we exercise our functions on the people’s behalf.

I. Introduction I truly appreciate this opportunity to address this distinguished audience at the invitation of the Keizai Club. Over the past several years  the Japanese economy has had to overcome the aftereffects of the bursting of the economic “bubble” while facing the weighty challenge of establishing an economic structure suitable for the new era. Although there were concerns about a deflationary spiral at one time  the economy has been recovering moderately since the beginning of 1996 partly due to strong monetary and fiscal support. Recently  this economic recovery has gradually firmed  offering signs that progress has been made toward establishing this suitable economic structure. However  since the beginning of the year  stock prices have fallen significantly  suggesting that market participants remain cautious about the economic outlook. With this in mind  I would like to discuss the Bank of Japan’s thinking on the recent economic developments and monetary policy management  together with the Bank’s views on the uncertain factors regarding the economic outlook. II. Domestic Economic Condition With regard to the domestic economic condition  the Bank of Japan’s judgment is that a moderate economic recovery continues  and that the economic recovery is gradually becoming firmer. When considering the strength of an economic recovery  the Bank pays attention to the positive interactions between production and private demand. Specifically  attention is given to whether the increase in production is leading to an expansion of business fixed investment through improved corporate profits  and whether this increased production is followed by a recovery in personal consumption through increased income. Looking back on the economic developments in Japan over the past year from a viewpoint of determining the strength of the recovery  the growth of aggregate demand  including public and housing investments  accelerated in the first half of 1996  and accordingly  market expectations of an economic recovery strengthened and long- term interest rates showed a temporary rise. However  no significant improvement was seen in production  as the increase in final demand was partly offset by inventory adjustment and by an increase in imports. As a result  a virtuous circle of demand  production  and income was not confirmed. This situation  however  appears to have changed somewhat in the latter half of 1996. Firstly  the decline in external demand  which had been a constraining factor of the economic recovery  halted in autumn 1996  mainly due to the increase in exports that followed a depreciation of the yen. Recently  there has been an upward trend in external demand. In addition  inventory adjustment in some raw materials and semiconductor industries was almost completed. As a result  production  which had remained sluggish in the first half of 1996  started to grow at an accelerating pace  reflecting fully the increase in final demand. BIS Review 35 /1997 - 2 - fixed including business Notably  the firm recovery in production is now generating a recovery in private demand  investment and personal consumption. Reflecting improvements in corporate sales and profits  the recovery in business fixed investment is spreading to a wider range of industries and to smaller firms than previously observed. Indeed  according to the results of the November 1996 “TANKAN -- Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan ” business fixed investment for the smaller firms  which had been slow to improve  is expected to show a year-to-year increase in fiscal 1996 for the first time in five years. Growth of personal consumption  the other mainstay of private demand  leveled off at one time in summer 1996  but resumed later in autumn  especially in consumer durables such as automobiles. The contributing factor to the moderate but steady recovery in personal consumption has been the improved income reflecting the favorable changes in employment conditions and wages that followed the increase in production. It must be borne in mind that the increase in demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate scheduled for fiscal 1997 is contributing to the improvement in economic indicators  as in housing investment  and therefore these improvements need to be seen in this light. There has  however  recently been a notable change in economic developments compared to the first half of 1996. Despite a gradual decrease in public-sector investment from the latter half of 1996  the virtuous circle -- in which increased production leads to increased private demand through improved corporate profits and employment income -- has clearly begun to operate. III. Uncertain Factors Regarding the Economic Outlook A. Views of Financial Market Participants Turning from the Bank of Japan’s views on the current domestic economy  the issue of concern now is the future development of the economy. Revitalization of economic activity usually brings about increases in corporate profits and employment income  which lead to improvements in business fixed investment and personal consumption. These improvements in turn lead to a further expansion in economic activity. However  developments in financial markets  such as stock prices and long- term interest rates  suggest that despite the increasing strength of the economic recovery  market participants remain cautious about the economic outlook. Various causes are cited for the significant fall in stock prices since the beginning of the year: renewed concern about the nonperforming-loan problem; uncertainty over the social and economic systems in Japan as a whole; and pressures to decrease the differential between domestic and international stock prices in terms of various measures of evaluation  such as the price/earnings ratio. It is extremely difficult to assess each factor and to specify the cause of the uncertainty. Still  the overall trend in the financial markets over the past several months clearly indicates that market participants have a cautious outlook on the economy  as shown by the slowdown in growth or even a decline in stock prices since autumn 1996  and by the concurrent decline in long-term interest rates. Cautiousness on the part of the market participants reflects the fact that they are strongly aware of the following three issues: (1) effects of the anticipated fiscal tightening in the next fiscal year; (2) structural adjustment pressures facing Japanese industry; and (3) balance-sheet adjustment of firms and the nonperforming- loan problem of financial institutions  both of which are burdens created by the economic “bubble” and its burst. BIS Review 35/1997 - 3 - Before explaining the Bank of Japan’s views on these issues  I would like to emphasize that my talk today is not intended to draw specific conclusions or to assess the levels of stock prices and interest rates. This requires careful analysis and is an issue on which a central bank governor should refrain from comment. Rather  I would like to give you an idea of how the Bank examines these issues. B. Effects of Fiscal Tightening The first issue that I would like to discuss is the influence of fiscal tightening -- such as reduction in public-sector investment  rise in the consumption tax rate  and termination of special tax reduction -- on the economy for the next fiscal year. Public-sector investment began to decline in autumn 1996  after having continued to expand until mid-1996 as a result of the economic measures introduced in autumn 1995. Although there may be a slight temporary increase in public-sector investment reflecting the implementation of the supplementary budget for the current fiscal year  the declining trend is expected to continue for some time. In addition  an increase in the consumption tax rate and the termination of the special tax reduction is scheduled for fiscal 1997. It is important to mention here that the influence of fiscal tightening on the economy may vary significantly depending on the prevailing economic conditions  such as corporate profits and employment income development  as well as on the confidence that the corporate and household sectors have in the economy. Furthermore  this influence can differ substantially depending on how the public’s expectations of the future economy change in response to reduced fiscal expenditures and tax increases  and how market interest rates respond to any reduction in the budget deficit. The effects on the economy of a reduction of public-sector investment or a budget deficit have been debated by academics. The simplest Keynesian view is that reduced public-sector investment cumulatively acts to restrain private demand through multiplier effects. Some argue that a decrease in the budget deficit will lower interest rates and the yen’s foreign exchange value  thus offsetting the negative effects on the economy. Some even hold that because the public behave rationally with anticipation of future tax increases or reductions  neither a decrease nor an increase in the budget deficit will have any effect on the economy. The influence of a reduced budget deficit on the economy may thus be complex and diverse  once the movement of market interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and the public’s expectations are taken into account. It is natural to assume that in reality  the impact of reduced fiscal expenditures on the economy cannot be denied  although the influence is unlikely to reach the extent estimated by simply multiplying the nominal value of the reduction by a multiplier. To underline the argument I just made  the economic mechanism does not work on the basis of simple addition and subtraction  but rather involves dynamic interactions of many factors which incorporates the public’s expectations. After all  the effects of fiscal tightening are an empirical issue for which conclusions cannot be reached in advance  and therefore  it is very difficult to accurately predict future developments at this stage. Bearing this in mind  it is necessary to view carefully the effects of fiscal tightening on the economy as a whole. BIS Review 35/1997 C. Progress in the Structural Adjustment of Industries - 4 - Let me now turn to the next issue of the structural adjustment of industries  which is a medium- to long-term issue for the Japanese economy. One of the changes in the environment surrounding the Japanese economy in the past several years has been that a wider range of industries have come to face severe international competition due to the increasing supply capacity of other East Asian countries. The weakening of international competitiveness made it difficult for some industries and firms to continue domestic production of some of their conventional products. This forced them to relocate their production bases overseas while shifting their domestic production to new products for which they have a comparative advantage. This is not the first time that the Japanese economy has faced structural adjustment pressures. In fact  it successfully confronted the challenge several times in the past. However  the adjustment this time has inevitably involved greater pains than in the past  due to the after-effects of the bursting of the economic “bubble.” Furthermore  as relocation overseas took place prior to a shift to new products  structural adjustment significantly constrained domestic production and  as a result  investment and employment were also limited. The negative impact was particularly substantial for the smaller firms  as many of them manufactured labor-intensive products and were subcontractors to the large firms which relocated their production bases overseas. The key factors we should keep in mind in projecting future developments in the Japanese economy are therefore the progress in the structural adjustment of industries  that is  the emergence of new products or industries that will promote future economic growth. A careful look at individual industries reveals some positive signs. In production  for example  an increasing number of firms and industries are shifting to goods with international competitiveness. More specifically  the production of producer goods and capital goods that are capital-intensive and technology-intensive has been increasing while the production of labor-intensive consumer goods has been declining. These changes are also reflected in imports and exports of goods. Recently  exports of consumer goods  mainly household electric appliances such as television sets and radios  have been decreasing while their imports have been increasing  and exports of capital goods and parts such as electronic machinery and automobile parts have been increasing significantly. Notable as these changes may be  one cannot simply add up these microeconomic developments to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of how successfully the Japanese economy as a whole is undergoing the structural adjustment of industries. Rather  the progress in structural adjustment should be reflected most evidently in the revitalization of forward-looking business activity. If this were the case  the stance taken by firms toward fixed investment and employment should provide a measure of the progress in macroeconomic structural adjustment. In this respect  business fixed investment by large firms began to recover in fiscal 1995 well ahead of small and medium-sized firms. Investment by smaller firms  which had been more susceptible to structural adjustment pressures  has also finally begun to show a recovery. Although the recovery is extremely moderate  this resumption of investment by smaller firms  an activity that lays the foundation for the future  may be considered as evidence of progress in BIS Review 35/1997 - 5 - structural adjustment as it indicates that these firms are starting to have a clear idea about the new direction of their business. Progress is also reflected in the business fixed investment of various industries. Namely  investment has been increasing in capital- and production-goods related sectors  where high growth in production has been recorded. There has also been a rapid expansion of investment in a new industry of mobile telecommunications. Business fixed investment for development of new products and new businesses also seems to be increasing gradually. With regard to employment  structural adjustment pressures are persistent in some indicators such as the high unemployment rate. However  based on the most recent changes in employment indicators and the microeconomic information on firms  labor market conditions are seen to be improving gradually  indicating steady progress in industrial restructuring. For example  recent numbers of new job offers are significantly higher than those in the previous year. Business surveys indicate that an increasing number of firms plan  for the first time in many years  to increase the number of new graduates hired in the next fiscal year. Results of the November TANKAN also indicate that more than half of the smaller firms surveyed feel that they are shorthanded. Furthermore  labor market conditions in each sector indicate that employment has decreased significantly in sectors where imports have been making inroads -- such as the electrical machinery and textiles industries -- while employment has increased in new sectors such as telecommunications. These changes indicate a gradual shift of labor between sectors. In sum  although pressures for the structural adjustment of industries remain  it can be said that structural adjustment has progressed significantly as reflected in the recent recovery in business fixed investment and employment. D. Balance-Sheet Adjustment The third issue to be discussed is that of balance-sheet adjustment. There are two aspects to this issue: the improvement of the financial condition of firms and the disposal of nonperforming loans of financial institutions. With regard to the balance-sheet adjustment of Japanese firms  there have been serious efforts by firms to reduce their liabilities since the bursting of the economic “bubble.” Despite these efforts  the mismatch between assets and liabilities expanded in many sectors until 1994 or 1995 due to the continued decline in real estate prices. While the decline in asset prices has slowed since 1995  liabilities have decreased owing to the recovery in corporate profits which followed firms’ restructuring efforts and lower interest rates. Several indicators  such as the ratio of long-term debts to assets at market value  reveal that balance-sheet adjustment pressures are persistent. In particular  small and medium-sized firms still need to make substantial efforts to complete their adjustment. As I have just mentioned  however  the improvement of firms’ balance sheets has doubtlessly been making moderate but steady progress in general  and thus  constraints imposed by the adjustment pressures on economic recovery should continue to be gradually alleviated. Regarding the nonperforming-loan problem of financial institutions  the total amount of nonperforming loans of the financial institutions was approximately 29 trillion yen as of the end of September 1996  according to the data published by the Ministry of Finance. Of BIS Review 35/1997 - 6 - this total  the estimated amount of problem loans to be disposed of  not including those already covered by collateral and provisions  is estimated at approximately 7 trillion yen. Both of these figures have decreased by approximately 10 trillion yen from the previous year  and thus  in general  it can be said that steady progress has been made in solving this particular problem. The amount of nonperforming loans that need to be disposed of  however  remains large. The Bank of Japan will continue to strongly encourage financial institutions to dispose of the remaining nonperforming loans expeditiously and to exert themselves to the utmost to (1) restore their capital bases which have been impaired in the process of disposing of nonperforming loans; (2) strengthen their profitability through restructuring; and (3) enhance their internal risk management. In relation to the economy  an issue of concern is whether the decline in the intermediary functions of those financial institutions burdened with nonperforming loans is constraining economic recovery. While it may certainly be true that financial institutions have imposed stricter screening criteria for lending following the experiences of the economic “bubble” period  most financial institutions now maintain a policy of actively increasing loans of reliable quality while  or rather for the purpose of  disposing of nonperforming loans. In fact  the lending attitude of financial institutions  as seen from the point of view of the firms  has become less severe and lending rates have stayed at a historically low level. It is  therefore  difficult to assume that the severer lending attitude of the financial institutions is hampering the recovery in business fixed investment. IV. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Management A. Economic Outlook I have so far discussed such issues as the effects of fiscal tightening and the current situation of structural adjustment  both considered to be the major factors contributing to the cautious economic outlook in financial markets. Among these  developments of structural adjustment may be summarized as follows: (1) both the structural adjustment of industries and balance-sheet adjustment are still in progress and therefore the pace of economic recovery is likely to remain moderate for some time; (2) however  as industrial restructuring and balance- sheet adjustment are making steady progress  albeit moderate  its constraining effects on economic recovery are likely to gradually ease. Therefore  the most important issue in considering the economic outlook is whether the increase in private demand can overcome the downward pressures from fiscal tightening and whether it is possible  as a result  to lead the economy on to a path of self- sustained recovery. As I mentioned earlier  economic recovery has been recently gaining strength. If this recovery is analyzed in terms of the level of economic activity  namely the output gap  it can be noted that capacity utilization has been rising steadily reflecting the recent recovery in production  and has recovered to the same level as that of four years ago. Furthermore  the results of the November TANKAN indicated that the excessive production capacity and employment perceived by surveyed firms have gradually fallen to the same level as in 1987  at which time the economy was recovering from the recession caused by the appreciation of the yen. While the profit-to-sales ratio of smaller firms has not yet recovered to the average level of the past  the ratio of large firms has already reached a relatively high level. Judging overall  it BIS Review 35/1997 - 7 - can be said that the current level of economic activity in Japan is approaching the same point where the strength of the recovery began to firm in past business cycles. This level of economic activity will provide a basis for the virtuous circle of the economy  one that is led by expanded private demand  to gain further strength. In other words  if the recent economic recovery continues for some time  increased production will further improve corporate profits and employment income  which in turn are likely to lead to increases in business fixed investment and personal consumption. If this virtuous circle gains stronger momentum  there will be a higher possibility of the strengthened virtuous circle absorbing the downward pressures from prospective fiscal tightening. A temporary slowdown in economic recovery seems inevitable as downward pressures from fiscal tightening will be strong during the first half of fiscal 1997 and as a reaction to the increase in demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate scheduled for April 1997 is expected. However  the recovery trend of the economy is likely to be sustained on account of the strengthening recovery in private demand. I indicated earlier  however  that it is necessary to consider the effects of fiscal tightening carefully. Business sentiment and consumer confidence are also becoming important factors for a further increase in private demand. The corporate and household sectors will plan their activities and put them into action in the form of production  investment  and consumption  taking into account the fiscal 1997 budget and the actual placement of public work orders. Therefore  in predicting future economic developments  it is important to closely examine various macro- and micro-economic data and not only the economic indicators that will be released in the future  but also firms’ business plans and signals sent by financial markets. Meanwhile  it is expected that prices will cease to decline due firstly to the rise in import prices reflecting the yen’s depreciation and higher crude oil prices  and secondly to the improvement in domestic supply and demand conditions. However  when considering the fact that the improvement in supply and demand conditions is expected to be moderate for now and that the pressures of global competition will persist  there is only a limited possibility that domestic prices will follow a clear upward trend. Yet  as foreign exchange rates have recently shown rather rapid movements  it is necessary to cautiously monitor the effects of such a development on the domestic economy. While refraining from making any comments on the recent foreign exchange rate levels and movements  the Bank’s fundamental thinking is that it is desirable for exchange rates to be stable and determined in accordance with the real economic conditions of each country. Based on this thinking  the Bank of Japan will continue to carefully monitor foreign exchange rate developments and their effects on the Japanese economy. B. Monetary Policy Management In the management of current monetary policy  the Bank of Japan will continue to monitor economic developments closely  placing emphasis on further strengthening the foundation of an economic recovery. In April 1997  the consumption tax rate will be raised from 3 percent to 5 percent. Therefore  I would also like to discuss how the Bank of Japan views the possible effects of this tax rate rise on prices  in the context of managing monetary policy. Specifically  the issue here is BIS Review 35/1997 - 8 - what monetary policy measures should be taken in light of the price hikes due to the rise in the tax rate. I would first like to point out that the price hikes caused by the rise in the consumption tax rate is different in nature from the ordinary rise in prices  that is inflation. Generally  inflation is generated in the mechanism of economic cycles as a result of  for example  tightening of supply and demand conditions for labor or products  or excessive supply of money. In turn  inflation affects economic activity in various ways. In contrast  price hikes due to a rise in the consumption tax rate are equivalent to a once only rewriting of all the old price tags on April 1. There are no relevant changes in economic activity  such as a tightening of supply and demand conditions  an increase in wages  or excessive money supply. Therefore  it would not be appropriate to formulate monetary policy against such superficial changes in prices. Although this represents the fundamental thinking of the Bank  it does not mean that the central bank is indifferent to the rise in the consumption tax rate. If the rise triggers price hikes taking advantage of the tax rate rise  or if overall inflationary expectations are heightened  then the risk of a genuine inflation will arise. In particular  this risk cannot be disregarded when the supply and demand conditions for products are fairly tight. Therefore  it is necessary to pay attention to the inflationary expectations and possible over-reactions caused by the rise in the consumption tax rate rather than paying attention to the previously-mentioned superficial hikes in prices. In summary  in order to promote a smooth structural adjustment  to bring about a strengthening of the economic recovery  and to encourage the renewed development of the Japanese economy  the implementation of a drastic structural reform  including effective deregulation  is indispensable. In this respect  I hope that the government will continue to exercise strong leadership and earnest efforts will continue to be made by various parties. V. Financial System Reform and Revision of the Bank of Japan Law A. Financial System Reform I would like to use the remaining time to discuss financial system reform and the revision of the Bank of Japan Law. The important challenge for Japan today is to vigorously promote structural reform as discussed above  and this also applies to the reform of the financial markets and of the financial system. Financial markets worldwide have experienced significant changes in recent years amid rapid financial and economic globalization and technological innovation. New financial instruments such as derivatives and securitized products have been developed in succession to provide firms and households with diverse means of risk-hedging  investment  and financing. At the same time  profit opportunities for financial institutions have expanded in various fields. It seems that it is now time for the market participants to select the market  rather than the markets selecting the participants. Countries are vying with each other to reform their financial markets  based on a growing worldwide perception that the financial services sector BIS Review 35/1997 - 9 - will show rapid growth and create numerous employment opportunities into the twenty-first century. Each country is thus striving to make their own markets attractive to participants. Japan  too  has engaged in the review of regulations and systems to promote financial deregulation. However  reform has been gradual and financial institutions have tended to deal with it cautiously due to the severe challenge they have had to face after the bursting of the economic “bubble.” As a result  the Tokyo market has fallen far behind the New York and London markets in terms of its ability to develop financial instruments that incorporate new techniques. In recognition of this  Prime Minister Hashimoto proposed the “Big Bang” deregulation package for Japan. I understand that the purpose of this financial reform package is to revitalize the Tokyo market as a free and active global market. The Bank believes that the aims of this reform package are most appropriate and as a central bank  intends to contribute to the achievement of its goals. In carrying out the reform  it is especially important that the three basic principles of freedom  fairness  and globalization are strictly followed  and that the pace of the reform is not relaxed. The “Big Bang” package aims to realize and complete all reforms by the year 2001  immediately implementing any measures on which study has been concluded. However  this should not mean that the process of market reform become unduly gradual or slow  as this may jeopardize the consistency of the reform  or result in only an easier part of the reform being implemented. For example  one deregulation measure included in the “Big Bang” package and highly valued by the Bank is the fundamental revision of the Foreign Exchange Control Law. If deregulation in other areas proceeds too slowly  the effects of the new Foreign Exchange Control Law might encourage financial transactions to shift to overseas markets and might then lead to the hollowing-out of the Tokyo market. In order to avoid such a turn of events  it is most important to bring about concrete measures within the shortest possible time to maintain the coherence of the deregulation as a whole. B. Revision of the Bank of Japan Law Lastly  I would like to discuss the revision of the Bank of Japan Law. The revision of the Bank of Japan Law is now in the final stage of deliberation by the Financial System Research Council  an advisory committee to the Minister of Finance  following discussions last year by the Central Bank Study Group  an advisory panel to the Prime Minister. The Bank has made public its views on the Bank of Japan Law revision at a press conference held at the end of 1996 and on other occasions. To summarize  (1) the Bank holds that the basic views stated by the Central Bank Study Group -- that is  ensuring central bank independence and enhancing transparency -- should be clearly stated in the law; and (2) the Bank believes that further deliberations should be conducted on several issues regarding the relationship between the government and the central bank  on which the Central Bank Study Group was unable to reach conclusions  so as to duly reflect the two concepts of independence and transparency. BIS Review 35/1997 - 10 - Fortunately  the Bank’s views appear to be adequately shared by the members of the Financial System Research Council. I would therefore like to discuss today the significance of the revision of the Bank of Japan Law to the Japanese economy as a whole. First  this revision of the central bank system is a response to the global trend of changes  including financial and economic globalization and marketization  which have been driven by progress in financial innovation. On various occasions in the past  I have discussed how in the new financial environment  markets around the world respond instantaneously to various information and they also respond to changes in the expectations of market participants as the participants process such information. The “Big Bang” package is likely to promote this tendency through increased efficiency and globalization of the markets. Under such circumstances  if the role and responsibility of the central bank in charge of monetary policy management are not made clear  or if both domestic and overseas understanding of the central bank’s monetary policy management is insufficient  a country’s monetary policy intentions may not permeate sufficiently throughout the market. In addition  irrelevant information may disrupt the markets. The idea of entrusting the responsibility of ensuring price stability with the central bank  an establishment detached from short-term interests  is a wisdom acquired from the history of battles against inflation. The recent strengthening of central bank independence and the growing demand for transparency of monetary policy management around the world reflect the stronger emphasis on the status and responsibility of central banks to meet the new challenges presented by the global changes in the financial markets. Second  in order for the financial markets or the financial system of a country to function efficiently and stably  appropriate policy and operational management by the central bank  which rests at the core of the financial system  is indispensable. The Japanese financial system is a mechanism for intermediating savings and investments by the efficient allocation of funds by means of a currency called the “yen.” In order for this mechanism to function properly  (1) the value of money -- in other words  domestic prices -- must be stable; (2) the mechanism for settling transactions by means of money must be efficient and convenient; and (3) private financial institutions  as the members of the financial system  as well as the central bank must be sound and reliable. The maintenance of these three conditions -- that is  price stability  stable operations of the payment and settlement systems  and the resulting soundness of the financial system -- is the important responsibility of the central bank  an institution which has a primary role in the issuance and circulation of the “yen.” The central bank system is thus an important component of the financial system infrastructure of Japan. Therefore  in order to win domestic and overseas confidence in the Japanese financial markets and to maintain and improve the international competitiveness of these markets  it is essential that the central bank system is able to win domestic and overseas confidence  and that the market environment is improved through such efforts as the “Big Bang” reform package. Third  many of the issues raised regarding the revision of the Bank of Japan Law can also be applied to economic structural reform and to administrative reform in Japan. BIS Review 35/1997 - 11 - The Bank of Japan has urged that (1) its organizational objectives and roles be clarified; and (2) the management of policy and operations be founded on a mechanism which allows the market participants and other third parties to monitor ex post facto whether the Bank is discharging its responsibility appropriately  rather than be part of a mechanism that attaches importance to advance coordination with the government. This argument applies not only to the central bank. In fact  it may be applied generally to the question of what the economic and financial systems should be or what the role of government administration should take to meet the challenges of a new era. The Japanese economy today is required to function within a mechanism under which any institution is responsible for its own course of action and then the market and the public examine and evaluate the actions taken  instead of within a system governed by advance examination based on administrative supervision and regulations. Such reforms will fundamentally change the economic and social structures of Japan  making them more consistent with global standards. The old methodology of carrying out reforms within the conventional framework and ways of thinking must be changed. It is necessary to consider how the distinctive systems and ways of thinking in Japan could be changed from a perspective of global standards. The issue of the revision of the Bank of Japan Law has drawn attention overseas along with the “Big Bang” package of financial reforms. This is because the revision of the Law is regarded as a test case of whether or not Japan can change itself. To repeat my earlier point  the Bank of Japan strongly hopes that the two concepts put forward by the Central Bank Study Group -- that is  ensuring central bank independence and enhancing transparency -- will be clearly reflected in the revised Bank of Japan Law. I wish to make clear that the revision of the Law is not an issue that solely concerns the Bank of Japan  the monetary authorities  and the financial community  but is an issue closely related to the future course of the Japanese economy as a whole. It is very important for the Bank of Japan to prove its ability to reform itself and to win domestic and overseas confidence through constant efforts toward appropriate policy and operational management. As part of such efforts  the Bank last year announced plans for the revision of policy and operational management  including the holding of regular meetings of the Policy Board for monetary policy decisions and the disclosure of the summary of those meetings. We at the Bank are determined to further promote vigorously institutional and operational reform. I would like to conclude by asking for your continued understanding and support. I am most grateful for the kind attention you have given me today. BIS Review 35/1997
r970409a,1997-04-09,https://www.bis.org/review/r970409a.pdf,Mr. Duisenberg comments on the importance of the European pact for stability and growth (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  20 Mar 97),Address by Dr. W.F. Duisenberg  President of the Netherlands Bank and the Bank for International Settlements  on the occasion of his acceptance of the Business Week Award  awarded by the Business Week Committee of the Economische Faculteitsvereniging of the Erasmus University in Rotterdam on 20/3/97.,Mr. Duisenberg comments on the importance of the European pact for stability and growth Address by Dr. W.F. Duisenberg  President of the Netherlands Bank and the Bank for International Settlements  on the occasion of his acceptance of the Business Week Award  awarded by the Business Week Committee of the Economische Faculteitsvereniging of the Erasmus University in Rotterdam on 20/3/97. It is a great honour for me to accept one of the two Business Week Awards of 1997. I would like to thank the Business Week Committee for awarding me this prestigious prize. Also  I would like to congratulate my fellow award-winner professor Franco Modigliani  whose work has covered many fields in economics in general  and in the theory of monetary policy and finance in particular. As the theme of this year’s Business Week  the organising Committee chose “IMPACT: all things are in a flux and nothing remains”. The first part of the theme  “impact”  is certainly valid for the world of banking and finance. Shifts in international capital flows have important repercussions on economic developments in individual countries and regions. Changes in interest rates influence economic decisions by private companies and households  and consequently have an impact on our daily lives. Furthermore  the establishment of European Economic and Monetary Union will drastically change the institutional setting of money and monetary policy in the member states of the European Union  and will have a strong positive impact on the economic development of Europe in the next century. The second part of this year’s theme  “all things are in flux and nothing remains”  is somewhat more difficult for me to subscribe to. Being a central banker  it is almost against my basic instinct to see all things as being in flux and that nothing remains. By nature  central bankers are strongly in favour of smooth and stable developments. However  this does not imply that we are against change. For example  the movement towards European Economic and Monetary Union is a fundamental change from the past. What is important is that changes which have a significant impact on monetary and economic developments are embedded in structures of stability. The combination of policy impact and stability  that is the crucial issue for central bankers. Therefore  in the European Economic and Monetary Union  the policy impact and stability will be provided by an independent European Central Bank  the primary objective of which is to maintain price stability. To support this objective  the European Economic and Monetary Union will have several institutional features which are aimed at providing an underlying framework of stability for the ECB’s monetary policy. For example  a mechanism for exchange rate stability is presently being designed to ensure that the countries which do not meet the convergence criteria in time can retain close links with the core group. Moreover  a mechanism is presently being developed that aims at realising fiscal stability in EMU as well. This mechanism is the pact for stability and growth  and was agreed upon during the summit of the European Council in Dublin last December. Given the importance of fiscal stability for achieving monetary and price stability in EMU  I would like to touch upon three issues related to the pact for stability and growth. First  why do we need the pact as a fundamental characteristic of EMU? Second  what are the elements of the pact? Third  what are the misunderstandings about the pact? The first issue – the reasons why we need a pact for stability and growth in EMU – may be explained by my fundamental belief that a lack of fiscal discipline would negatively affect the ability of the European Central Bank to achieve its primary objective to maintain price stability. First  if the ECB is to be able to pursue a price stability-oriented monetary policy  loose fiscal policies in Member States must be avoided  as such a situation would endanger the credibility of the ECB and would place a heavy burden on the ECB’s BIS Review 36/1997 - 2 - monetary policy. Loose fiscal policies might push up interest rates  with the ECB being blamed for pursuing an overly strict monetary policy. Although a central banker is used to being blamed for all kinds of unsatisfactory economic developments  it is better to prevent this to the extent possible. The pact aims at ensuring that fiscal discipline will be achieved  not only before the start of EMU  but thereafter as well. Member States have agreed to pursue medium-term objectives for a budget close to balance or even in surplus. The likelihood of interference with monetary policy is thus reduced. As a result  the foundation for a stable and sound economic development in Europe is established. Not without reason is the pact referred to as the pact for stability and growth. Second  because of fiscal imbalances  aggregate demand can expand and may directly cause upward pressure on prices. As a result  given its primary objective of price stability  the ECB will be obliged to offset this expansion by implementing a restrictive monetary policy. In the end  the European economy will be confronted with higher fiscal deficits and higher interest rates  similar to the bad experiences of the seventies and early eighties. Third  high and persistent fiscal imbalances indirectly fuel inflationary expectations  because they raise the issue of sustainability. Fourth  an additional reason for the establishment of a pact for stability and growth is the possible danger of “free rider” behaviour by individual Member States. If national fiscal policies would not be governed by certain explicit and clear rules  individual Member States could implement unbalanced fiscal policies and to a large extent pass on the negative consequences to the other Member States. Fifth  the introduction of a stability and growth pact will safeguard the fiscal convergence that has been achieved during recent years  when EU Member States started to bring down fiscal deficits in order to meet the Maastricht criteria. Sixth  against the background of growing government fiscal deficits  both in Europe and the United States the fiscal situation of the government has become an issue of growing academic concern. As a result  a substantial number of important studies on the need for balanced budget rules have been published  establishing the theoretical framework for the necessary change towards fiscal consolidation. It should be noted that fiscal imbalances of the government are a relatively recent phenomenon. As has been stated regarding the United States by Nobel prizewinner professor James Buchanan  who is one of the strongest supporters of balanced budget rules: “Traditionally  before the 1960’s  governments had resorted to debt as a means of financing only extraordinary expenditures  for the most part expenditures that were necessary to finance wars and other short-lived emergencies. Public debt  so created  was always substantially reduced  or paid off  after most wars for most countries”. 1 Also in Europe  during the sixties and the early seventies  budgets close to balance or even in surplus were regarded as normal. It will not be a surprise that I think that we should go back to normal. For example  the average of total government gross debt for the present 15 EU Member States in 1970 was 34.6% of GDP. In 1995  this figure had risen to 71.7% of GDP  a doubling in 25 years. In the case of the Netherlands  the figure for government debt rose from almost 47% of GDP in 1980 to around 80% of GDP in 1995  an increase of 70% in just 15 years. However  the rapid growth of government debt did not result in a significant reduction of unemployment. On the contrary: the doubling of the average EU government debt level in 25 years was accompanied by a more than quadrupling of the average unemployment level. Also in the Netherlands  rapid increases in government debt were attended by increasing unemployment levels. These recent experiences show that accommodative fiscal policies are not a guarantee for reducing unemployment. 1 George Mason University  1984  Mimeograph  pp.8-9. J.M. Buchanan  “The Deficit and American Democracy  Center for Study of Public Choice”  BIS Review 36/1997 - 3 - Let me now briefly discuss the second issue – what are the elements of the pact for stability and growth? The pact for stability and growth will take the form of two regulations  and a political resolution from the European Council. The resulting regulatory framework represents a judicious balance between prevention – via the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary policies - and deterrence – via the establishment of a dissuasive set of rules. The pact will oblige Member States (or the “ins”) to submit stability programmes. In these programmes  medium-term budgetary targets will be stipulated  which should be set close to balance or even at a small surplus. Non-euro Member States (or the “pre-ins”) will submit convergence programmes. Furthermore  the pact will include a sanction mechanism that will be used when countries fail to meet the 3% reference value. If the Council of Ministers judges that a Member State has an excessive deficit  sanctions would  as a rule  be imposed in the calendar year following the year in which the excessive deficit was recorded or identified. The sanction would consist of a non-interest-bearing deposit between 0.2% and 0.5% of GDP. In the case of the Netherlands  this would imply a maximum fine of somewhat over 3 billion guilders. The third element of the pact  the European Council resolution  will reflect the political commitment to a strict and timely application of all the provisions of the pact. Thus  the resolution will provide firm political guidance to the parties who will implement the pact for stability and growth. Both regulations  together with the resolution  constitute an important framework for stability. If the countries adhere to the provisions of the pact  they will observe a safety margin in respect of the fiscal deficit to make sure that  even in times of cyclical adversity  the deficit will not exceed the 3%-reference value of the Maastricht Treaty. The stability pact aims at ensuring that countries  once they have joined EMU  will continue to abide by the rules for sound public finance. Finally  I would like to address some misunderstandings about the pact. It is often said that the major drawback of the pact for stability and growth is that it takes away all flexibility and sovereignty in the budgetary area. This is not correct. As soon as a structural budgetary position of close to balance is reached  any negative cyclical development is allowed to feed into the deficit  that is  up to the 3% limit  agreed upon in the Maastricht Treaty six years ago. Calculations show that this gives ample room for the so-called automatic stabilisers to do their job. That is to say  if in times of economic fortune Member States establish sound fiscal positions  they will have sufficient budgetary room to react adequately to economic downturns. In this respect  the pact for stability and growth is nothing more than the communal equivalence of the Dutch saying ”Save first  spend later”. Thus  budgetary flexibility is explicitly part of the pact. As regards sovereignty  it has to be recalled that only the level of the deficit will be restricted. No limits or guidelines will apply to the size or composition of government receipts and expenditures. The sovereignty of national parliaments will remain fundamentally intact. In my opinion  it is even of the utmost importance that this sovereignty will remain intact: if the stability and convergence programmes are to be credible  they have to be supported by the national parliaments. Some critics of the pact claim that it allows for too much flexibility. To them  I would like to emphasise that the pact for stability and growth will introduce a high degree of automaticity in the assessment of Member States’ budgetary policies. Only under exceptional circumstances – such as occurred in less than 6% of the cases in the past 35 years – may Member States be allowed a budget deficit above the 3%-reference value of the Maastricht Treaty; even then this excess will need to be temporary and limited. Thus  the pact constitutes a careful balance between flexibility and automaticity  and between prevention and deterrence. As you might know  the details of the pact for stability and growth are now being worked out. I expect that at its June 1997 meeting in Amsterdam  which will be hosted by De Nederlandsche Bank  the European Council will reach full agreement on this most important issue. To conclude  from a central banker’s perspective  the crucial issue for stable and sound economic developments is the impact of stability. More specific  what is important is the BIS Review 36/1997 - 4 - impact of price stability  achieved through the interrelated set of monetary stability  exchange rate stability and fiscal stability. That is why the pact for stability and growth is one of the cornerstones of the EMU. It will establish a foundation of fiscal stability under the operations of the European Central Bank  and thereby contribute to the impact of its policies. BIS Review 36/1997
r970409b,1997-04-09,https://www.bis.org/review/r970409b.pdf,Mr. Greenspan looks at the need for financial reform and the importance of a decentralized banking structure in the United States (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  22 Mar 97),Remarks by the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  Mr. Greenspan  at the Annual Convention of the Independent Bankers Association of America in Phoenix  Arizona  on 22/3/97.,Mr. Greenspan looks at the need for financial reform and the importance of a decentralized banking structure in the United States Remarks by the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  Mr. Greenspan  at the Annual Convention of the Independent Bankers Association of America in Phoenix  Arizona  on 22/3/97. As always  it is a pleasure to address this convention of the Independent Bankers Association of America. This is the sixth year I have addressed this convention  and during that time four separate Congresses have debated how best to reform the financial system. I last spoke to you about financial reform in 1994  in Orlando  and it is clear that the real world occurrences of the past three years have not diminished the relevance of those words. Therefore  I shall reemphasize some of those thoughts today in the context of legislative proposals that are now before the current Congress. Let me begin by reiterating the essential thrust of the Federal Reserve’s position regarding financial reform. We believe that any changes  either in regulation or legislation  should be consistent with four basic objectives: (1) continuing the safety and soundness of the banking system; (2) limiting systemic risk; (3) contributing to macroeconomic stability; and (4) limiting the spread of both the moral hazard and the subsidy implicit in the safety net. My remarks today will focus primarily on the macroeconomic and risk implications of financial reform and how  in particular  such reform must enable community banks to maintain their critical role in the macroeconomy. The importance of the community bank Our banking system is the most innovative  responsive  and flexible in the world. At its core is a banking structure that is characterized by very large numbers of relatively small banks -- more than 7000 separate banking organizations. This banking structure is very different from that of other industrialized nations -- for example  there are less than 500 banks incorporated in England  Germany  and Canada combined. To be sure  the very largest U.S. banking organizations account for the lion’s share of banking assets. Still  no one institution controls more than 6 percent of total domestic banking assets in the United States. This highly decentralized  highly diverse banking structure is almost certainly the direct result of our market economy itself. Indeed  it is revealing that the first edition of Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations was published in 1776  the year of the birth of our nation. Our market-driven economy  founded on Smith’s principle of “natural liberty” in economic choice  and the banking structure that evolved within that economy  have proved to be remarkably resilient. During the banking crisis of the late 1980s -- a crisis which was felt in banking systems throughout the world -- more than one thousand U.S. banks failed. But less than a decade later  loan loss reserves and bank capital at U.S. institutions stand at their highest levels in almost a half century. Moreover  the reestablishment of equilibrium regarding safety and soundness in our banking system was accomplished without costing the taxpayers a penny. To be sure  the effects of the banking crisis  as well as the ongoing pace of consolidation within the industry  have reduced the total number of banking organizations by more than a third since 1980. Nevertheless  we remain a nation characterized by a large number of smaller community banks -- just as we are a nation characterized by a diversity and small average size of our nonfinancial businesses. Moreover  one cannot easily imagine nor desire that the decentralized  diverse nature of our banking system will fundamentally change any time soon. There is  of course  a strong connection between our banking structure and the nature of BIS Review 36/1997 - 2 - our small-business-oriented economy. Smaller banks traditionally have been the source of capital for small businesses that do not generally have access to securities markets. In turn  small  new businesses  often employing new technology  account for much of the growth in employment in our economy. The new firms come into existence often to replace old firms that were not willing or able to take on the risks associated with high-growth strategies. This replacement of stagnating firms with dynamic new firms -- what the economist Joseph Schumpeter called the “perennial gale of creative destruction” -- is at the heart of our robust  growth-oriented economy. It is this freedom to take on risk that characterizes our economy and  by extension  our banking system. Legislation and regulation of banks  in turn  generally should not aim to curtail the predilection of businesses and their banks to take on risk -- so long as the general safety and soundness of our banking system is maintained. As I have said many times  regulators and legislators should not act as if the optimal degree of bank failure were zero. Rather  policymakers must continually assess the tradeoff between  on the one hand  protecting the financial system and the taxpayers  and on the other hand  allowing banks to perform their essential risk-taking activities  including the extension of risky credit. Optimal risk-taking on the part of our banks means that some mistakes will be made and some institutions will fail. Indeed  even if a bank is well-managed  optimal risk-taking means that such a bank can simply get unlucky. Either through mistakes of management or through the vagaries of economic luck  bank failure will occur  and such failure should be viewed as part of a natural process within our competitive system. Just as regulators and legislators must accept failure  they also must not  in their zealousness to maintain a safe and sound financial system  artificially restrict competition among banks or between banks and their nonbank counterparts. For example  we should not repeat the experiment with “micromanagement” of bank activities that was embodied in the 1991 FDICIA legislation  much of which was repealed in the 1994 banking legislation. In this regard  so long as we do not place artificial regulatory roadblocks in their way  I am not overly concerned with the ability of our smaller banks to compete with their large  regional or national counterparts. Our research shows that  when a large bank enters a new market through acquisition of an existing smaller institution  typically lending to small businesses initially declines. But then existing community banks take up the slack by lending to the borrowers spurned by the larger organization. Indeed  several community bankers have commented that they welcome the entry of large institutions into their markets via the acquisition route  seeing it as an opportunity to acquire some of the customer base that often is lost by the newly acquired bank. The dual banking system and the importance of choice of federal regulators Just as our decentralized banking structure is a key to the robustness of our macroeconomy  a key to the effectiveness of our banking structure is what we term the dual banking system. Our system of both federal and state regulation of banks has fostered a steady stream of innovations that likely would not have proceeded as rapidly or as effectively if our regulatory structure were characterized by a monolithic federal regulator. For example  the NOW account was invented by a state-chartered bank. Also  the liberalization of prohibitions against interstate banking has its origin in the so-called “regional compacts” that permitted interstate affiliations for banking companies in consenting states. Adjustable rate mortgages are yet another example of innovation at the state level that has benefitted financial institutions and their customers. BIS Review 36/1997 - 3 - Just as important as the fostering of innovation is the protection the dual banking system affords against overly rigid federal regulation and supervision. The key to protecting against overzealousness in regulation is for banks to have a choice of more than one federal regulator. With two or more federal regulators  a bank can choose to change its charter thereby choosing to be supervised by another federal regulator. That possibility has served as a constraint on arbitrary and capricious policies at the federal level. True  it is possible that two or more federal agencies can engage in a “competition in laxity” -- but I worry considerably more about the possibility that a single federal regulator would become inevitably rigid and insensitive to the needs of the marketplace. So long as the existence of a federal guarantee of deposits and other elements of the safety net call for federal regulation of banks  such regulation should entail a choice of federal regulator in order to ensure the critical competitiveness of our banks. The job of a banking regulator  difficult under any circumstances and for a variety of reasons  is especially critical as it regards the connection running between banking risk and the impact of such risk-taking on the macroeconomy. As I have been pointing out  the historic purpose of banks is to take risk through the extension of credit to businesses and households -- credit that is so vital to the growth and stability of the economy. But this fact creates a significant conflict for banking regulators. On the one hand  regulators are concerned with the cost of bank failure to the taxpayer and the impact of such failures on the general safety and soundness of the financial system. On the other hand  banks must take risks in order to finance economic expansion. Decisions about tradeoffs must be made. In the early 1990s  we saw how  in response to FDICIA  new regulations  weakened capital  and large loan losses  banks reduced their willingness to take risks  thereby contributing to a credit crunch and slower economic growth. This recent episode demonstrates clearly how tricky are these tradeoffs between necessary risk taking and protecting the banking system; a swing too far in either direction can create both short-term and long-term difficulties. A regulator without responsibility for macroeconomic growth and stability tends to have a bias against risk-taking. Such a regulator receives no praise if the economy is functioning well  but is criticized if there are too many bank failures. For such a regulator  the tradeoffs are one-sided and  if the decisions of such a regulator were left unchecked  the result might be a stagnant economy at whose core was a stagnant banking system. In contrast  the Federal Reserve’s economic responsibilities are an important reason why we have striven to maintain a consistent bank regulatory policy  one that entails neither excessive tightness nor ease in supervisory posture. The former would lead to credit crunches  the latter  with a lag  would lead to excessive bank failures. Just as the probability of bank failure should not be the only concern of the effective regulator  bank regulation is not the only  or even the most important  factor that affects the banking business. The condition of the macroeconomy also has something to say about your success as a banker. In that regard  the generally favorable macroeconomic conditions we have been facing for the past few years suggest that bankers should now take pause and reassess the appropriateness of their lending decisions. Mistakes in lending  after all  are not generally made during recessions but when the economic outlook appears benevolent. Recent evidence of thin margins and increased nonbank competition in portions of the syndicated loan market  as well as other indicators  suggest some modest underwriting laxity has a tendency to emerge during good times. This suggests the need for a mild caution that bankers maintain sound underwriting standards and pricing practices in their lending activities. BIS Review 36/1997 - 4 - Toward financial reform without losing the strengths of our current system Let me now turn from general concerns over our regulatory structure to more specific concerns regarding the supervisory and regulatory treatment of our largest  most complex banking organizations -- a subject in which I suspect community banks have some considerable interest. As the 105th Congress contemplates financial reform legislation  it is critical to focus on the issue of how best to supervise risk-taking in these large entities and  in particular  whether there should be significant umbrella supervision for the entire banking organization. Historically  bank holding companies have been largely confined to financial activities that are similar to  often the same as  those permissible to commercial banks. Also historically  supervision of banking organizations  both large and small  has tended to focus mainly on the need to protect the bank. To some extent  this emphasis on the bank rather than the nonbank activities of the banking organization was prompted by  or permitted by  management techniques that tended not to treat risk-taking in integrated fashion across the entire holding company. The regulators’ main concern was the bank  and bank safety could be analyzed more or less remotely and distinctly from the nonbank activities of the banking organization. More recently  the focus of supervision of holding companies by the Federal Reserve is being modified to parallel the changes in the management of banking companies. Most large institutions in recent years have moved toward consolidated risk management across all their bank and nonbank activities. Should the Congress permit new nonbanking activities by banking organizations it is likely that these activities too would be managed on a consolidated basis from the point of view of risk-taking  pricing  and profitability analysis. Our regulatory posture must adjust accordingly  to focus on the decision-making process for the total organization. Especially as supervisors focus more on the measurement and management of market  credit  and operating risks  supervisory review of firm-wide processes increasingly will become the appropriate principle underlying our assessment of an organization’s safety and soundness. Some market participants -- especially nonbanks contemplating buying banks in the wake of any new Congressional legislation  as well as banks contemplating entering newly permissible nonbank activities -- are naturally concerned over the thought of bank-like regulation being extended to their nonbank activities. We share this concern  and last month we asked Congress to modify our mandate to permit the Fed to be more flexible on such issues as applications for new activities. At the same time  however  we believe there has been some considerable misunderstanding of our basic philosophy of holding company supervision. The focus of the Fed’s inspections of nonbank activities of bank holding companies is to gain a sense of the overall strength of the individual units and their interrelations with each other and the bank. As I indicated above  emphasis is placed on the adequacy of risk management and internal control systems. Only if there is a major deficiency in these areas would we intend for a bank holding company inspection to become in any significant way “intrusive ” and the number of such intrusive inspections of nonbanking activities should be quite small if managements are following prudent business practices. Some observers have questioned not only the need for umbrella supervision  but also the need for the Fed’s involvement in such supervision. In addition to the reasons I cited above for central bank involvement in supervision  there is the issue of systemic risk and the fact that it is primarily the Federal Reserve’s obligation to maintain stability in our financial system BIS Review 36/1997 - 5 - and that system’s interface with international financial markets. This obligation cannot be met solely via open market operations and use of the discount window  as powerful as these tools may be. Financial crises  when they occur  are unpredictable and diverse in nature. Globalization means that a domestic crisis can become international or that a foreign crisis can become a domestic concern. The Federal Reserve’s ability to respond quickly and effectively to any particular systemic threat rests primarily on our experience and expertise with the details of the U.S. and foreign banking and financial systems  including our familiarity with the payments and settlement system. This expertise  in turn  has been accumulated over the years primarily through our supervision of large domestic and multinational banking companies  and via our participation in large payments and settlement systems which are such a critical part of our financial infrastructure. In order to carry out our responsibility  the Fed must be directly involved in the supervision of banks of all sizes -- such as now provided by member banks -- and must also be able to address the problems of large banking companies if one or more of their activities endanger the stability of our financial system. This implies that the Federal Reserve have appropriate supervisory authority. Moreover  the new regulatory structure must retain our flexibility to respond to changes in the structure of the financial system  especially where such changes cannot easily be forecast in the wake of significant legislative changes. Systemic crises occur very rarely by their very definition. But when such crises do occur the consequences of slow or misdirected action are grave. The central bank  as the lender of last resort  must have the knowledge  the tools  and the authority necessary to act in a timely and decisive fashion. This is necessary to protect the whole financial system  not the least of which are the critical players among our community banks. Conclusions Let me conclude by reiterating two of the Federal Reserve’s most basic concerns as the current Congress deliberates the issue of financial reform. First  we should recognize the increasingly evident fact that financial firms of all sorts now engage routinely in a wide variety of financial activities that  just a few decades ago  were considered to be nontraditional. Even in cases where the financial activity is currently not permitted directly  the risks and returns of the activity can be mimicked through the prudent use of financial derivative instruments such as put and call options. We should recognize these facts and  in response  structure legislation that would permit the full economic integration of these various forms of financial activity  in order to gain the maximum operating efficiencies  the best tradeoffs between risk and return  and the most flexibility in meeting the needs of the customer. But new legislation should not attempt to accomplish too much too soon. The Board believes it is prudent to delay  or to implement in stages  broad authorization of nonfinancial activities for banking companies. We want to be sure of the smooth functioning of integrated financial activity before we address potential combinations of banking and commerce. Second  in permitting broadened financial powers  legislation should strive to maintain the current roles of both the dual banking system and the central bank. Financial reform should not be interpreted to mean regulatory reform for its own sake. Banks of all sizes must have their regulatory choices preserved  just as financial firms of all sizes should be permitted to engage prudently in a wide range of financial activity. Finally  the central bank must continue to be able to monitor and address activities of large banking organizations that might threaten the stability of the system. I am confident that prudent  reasoned financial reform can be accomplished in a manner that preserves the best of the current system while introducing the improvements that we all desire.

Stals  at the Sixth Session of the Conference of African Ministers of Finance and Governors of Central Banks arranged by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and held in Addis Ababa on 31/3/97. I INTRODUCTION 1. Background to the South African financial sector reform process Unlike many other countries on the African continent  South Africa has a well-established financial structure which includes a relatively independent central bank  sophisticated modern banking institutions and competitive financial markets. There developed  nevertheless  a need for far-reaching financial reforms in recent years. The experience of South Africa in this regard provides an interesting case study from which some lessons can be learned. The South African financial sector and  for that matter  its total economy  was isolated to a high degree from the rest of the world for more than a decade because of unacceptable internal political and social policies  and international punitive actions taken against the country. In the circumstances  developments in the financial sector did not keep abreast with the evolutionary international changes of the past twenty years. With a lack of external competition and economic concentration in a few powerful corporate conglomerates  a stagnating economy  and a comprehensive protective exchange control system  a “hot-house” climate was created that contributed to a retarded adjustment process of the financial sector. Major political and social reforms in South Africa culminated in the democratic election of the Government of National Unity in April 1994. The scene was then set for major changes  also in the economy of the country. Indeed  not only was the scene set  but the expectations of the people of the country demanded major reforms that would  as a minimum  provide a better economic performance and an increase in the standard of living of millions of previously disadvantaged members of the community. Over the past five years  South Africa was therefore not only challenged with the need for reintegrating the South African economy  and more in particular  the financial sector in a rapidly changing global financial environment  but also with the challenge of adapting to a new domestic socio-political structure. These adjustments in the financial sector  which are still in progress  were facilitated by the existence of a sophisticated  albeit marginally retarded  financial system with a long history of more than a century. The Government’s policy approach to the needed reforms is based on a gradual but resolved transformation of the financial sector  mainly by exposing domestic institutions more to international competition  by integrating policy measures  the institutional framework  and the financial markets gradually into the global village  and by adapting at the same time to the changing needs of the local community. In the next part of this paper  the attention is focused on the reform process of the financial system to meet these policy objectives. The new South Africa was also confronted with a daunting further challenge  and that is to become  and to be part of  Africa. With the admission of South Africa during the second half of 1994 to the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  comprising twelve countries in the Southern African region  new challenges were offered for the expansion of financial co-operation on a regional basis. The third part of this presentation will provide a BIS Review 37/1997 - 2 - brief summary of the progress so far made with co-operation amongst the central banks of the members of SADC in the implementation of financial reforms in the region. II FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORMS IN SOUTH AFRICA 2.1 Macroeconomic policy implications The integration of the South African financial system in the global economy obviously holds major implications for macroeconomic policies. A country that exposes itself to the whims and the fickleness of fund managers and financial traders operating in a technologically integrated global market system can no longer ignore the international norms and standards set for financial disciplines  prudent management  sound government and internal stability and security. Integration into the world financial system brings the advantage of access to a massive pool of excess saving in the mature economies of the world  but also demands from the individual participating country adherence to the disciplines of a global market economy. This presentation will  however not cover the consequences for macroeconomic policies of the financial reforms  but will rather concentrate on major institutional adjustments. Aspects of economic policy  such as exchange rate policies have been  or will be  covered in other sessions of this Conference. 2.2 The role and functions of the central bank The South African Reserve Bank was founded in 1921 as one of the first central banks to be established in the new world outside of Europe. The Bank therefore has a long history and experience  and has always operated with some autonomy from Government. Even today  the South African Reserve Bank is privately owned  with important restrictions on the rights of shareholders  for example that no individual shareholder may hold more than one-half per cent of the capital of the Bank  and that the Bank may not pay a dividend of more than 10 per cent per annum on the paid-up share capital of the Bank. Without going into the details of the functions and responsibilities of the South African Reserve Bank  the new South African Government recognised a few basic principles for the role of the central bank in the development of the economy. These can be summarised as follows: Monetary policy is part of overall macroeconomic policy for which Government takes final responsibility. There must therefore be good co-operation between the central bank and Government  and regular consultation must take place between the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the Minister of Finance. The task of the central bank must be clearly defined and must be restricted to the objective of creating a stable financial environment that will be conducive for optimum real economic development. The central bank must protect the value of the currency. For the implementation of monetary policy  the central bank must be given sufficient autonomy to enable it to make objective decisions on sensitive monetary policy issues  such as the level of interest rates  money supply guidelines  financial liquidity management and bank credit extension policies. The central bank must be accountable to Parliament. To give effect to this policy approach  the South African Government included the following mandate for the South African Reserve Bank in the new Constitution of the Republic of South Africa: BIS Review 37/1997 - 3 - “The primary object of the South African Reserve Bank is to protect the value of the currency in the interest of balanced and sustainable economic growth in the Republic. “The South African Reserve Bank  in pursuit of its primary object  must perform its functions independently and without fear  favour or prejudice  but there must be regular consultation between the Bank and the Cabinet member responsible for national financial matters”. 2.3 The development of the banking system South Africa has always had a private sector banking system  based on private sector ownership and on effective competition in a free market environment. The major reforms introduced in recent years to adapt the banking system to the needs of the country’s changed philosophies  macroeconomic policy objectives and international relationships  were therefore concentrated on improving the existing structure. Firstly  recognition was given in the banking legislation to the existence and role of “informal” banking business that developed mostly in the less developed communities over many years. The Banks Act was therefore amended to provide for the continuation of numerous informal savings clubs (“stokvels”) outside the normal constraints of bank regulation and supervision  but also then  of course  without access to central bank accommodation at the discount window. New legislation to provide for communal ownership of a banking institution was introduced in the form of the Mutual Banks Act. Secondly  banking institutions adapted their own internal policies to provide for greater participation in the social upliftment programmes of the country  for example by entering into an agreement with Government to provide a minimum amount per year for low-cost housing. On the other end of the spectrum  banks also introduced new electronic data processing systems  for example automated teller machines  and “smart card” facilities for a gradual introduction of electronic money. Thirdly  bank regulation and supervision underwent major changes over the past ten years to apply the world-wide supported directives of the Basle Committee. At this stage  bank regulation and supervision is based primarily on risk identification and management  with clearly defined roles for shareholders  boards of directors  senior management and internal and external auditors. Fourthly  the South African banking scene was opened up for foreign banks  and South African banks  in turn  were allowed to establish branch offices  subsidiaries and representative offices in many countries around the world. Today  in addition to about 35 domestic banks  there are more than 10 established branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks operative in South Africa  and about 60 international banks with representative offices in the country. South African banks have opened up 29 branches/subsidiaries in 13 other African countries. It is still too early to judge the effect of this wider competition on the South African banking system. There are signs  however  that it is beginning to squeeze the margins of banking business. In particular  the share of foreign banks in wholesale banking  foreign exchange business and financial market activity increased significantly. This was accompanied  BIS Review 37/1997 - 4 - however  by an almost explosive increase in the total volumes of business in these markets  which provided for continued growth in existing and newly-established institutions. 2.4 The development of financial markets Once again  the advantage of the new South Africa had inheriting well-established and relatively sophisticated financial markets. This did not mean  however  that no reforms were required in these markets. The most striking adjustments occurred in the capital market. A “big-bang” revolution took place in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange last year when: the market for trading in equities was separated from the bond market; an electronic screen trading system replaced the traditional open-floor outcry system; corporates and non-residents were allowed for the first time to become broker-members of the Exchanges; provision was made for negotiated commissions and principal versus broking trade by members of the Exchange. Over the past few years  a market in derivatives also developed  originally as an over-the-counter market  but since the establishment of the South African Futures Exchange (SAFEX) in 1990  on a more formal basis. These reforms  together with the other socio-politico-economic changes in the country  boosted turnovers in the financial markets. In 1996  the total turnover in equities on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange exceeded US $27 billion; total turnover in the Bond Market amounted to US $703 billion  and 4.1 million contracts were traded through SAFEX. Major changes also took place in the South African market for foreign exchange  particularly in the light of the gradual removal of exchange controls. South Africa has a floating exchange rate system in which about 30 authorised dealers in foreign exchange (banking institutions) make prices on a competitive basis  for foreign currencies (mostly US dollar). The exchange rate is therefore determined by underlying forces of demand and supply  influenced to a diminishing extent by Reserve Bank intervention (through exchange controls and direct active participation). The Reserve Bank is gradually reducing its participation in the market  and is now in the process of encouraging the development of a more active market in forward foreign exchange outside of the central bank. The average daily turnover in the South African market for foreign exchange over the past six months amounted to US $6.1 billion. The policy of the Reserve Bank is to continue to encourage the development of the financial markets  and to monitor these markets on a regular basis. The central bank itself  however  is reducing its own direct participation in the market-making processes. This applies to the market for foreign exchange and also the capital market. Negotiations for the transfer to the private sector of responsibility for the primary funding of government and for market-making in government bonds have reached an advanced stage. The Reserve Bank will eventually confine its participation in these markets to transactions (such as open-market operations) aimed at the achievement of defined monetary policy objectives. 2.5 The national payment  clearing and settlement system Up to now  the national payment  clearing and settlement system was vested in a joint venture between the Reserve Bank and the major commercial banks in the country. Clearing takes place on a daily basis through an electronic data process in a communal banking service facility known as the Automated Clearing Bureau (ACB). The ACB is  however  no longer able to stand up to the emerging pressures of the expanded activity in the financial BIS Review 37/1997 - 5 - markets. The Reserve Bank has therefore taken the initiative to introduce a major reform to the national payments  clearing and settlement system. In April 1998  a new integrated system will be introduced to provide for real-time on-line settlement on a gross basis of large transactions  and for a daily netting-process and final settlement of smaller transactions. The intention with this major reform project is to reduce the risk exposure of possible default by any individual institution that could lead to the collapse of the whole system. At the same time  the new system must be compatible with global network systems for payments and clearing operations  and must provide a framework for an integrated cross-border settlement system for the SADC region. 2.6 The gradual removal of exchange controls At the centre of the South African programme for financial reform is the gradual phasing-out of exchange controls. Comprehensive exchange controls were introduced in South Africa over an extended period of time  ranging from 1961 to 1993. These direct control measures were intended to provide some protection to the domestic economy against the adverse effects of non-economic factors that afflicted South Africa over a long period of time. When the Government of National Unity came into power in April 1994  it was accepted as a policy objective to remove the exchange controls. At that time  however  South Africa had virtually no official foreign reserves at its disposal for this purpose. The pragmatic solution was therefore adopted to embark on a process of a gradual phasing-out of the exchange controls. Good progress has been made over the past three years with this programme. So far all effective exchange controls on current account transactions have been lifted; exchange controls applicable to non-residents have been fully removed; the two-tier exchange rate system for certain capital account transactions was formally terminated in 1995; South African resident corporates were given permission to make certain direct investments in branches and subsidiaries in foreign countries; South African resident institutional investors (insurers  pension funds and mutual funds) may now diversify up to 10 per cent of the total assets managed by them in foreign currency denominated assets; and South African resident private individuals will shortly be allowed to transfer limited amounts of capital from South Africa for foreign investment. The removal of the exchange controls is a process that has far-reaching effects for the financial sector and the development of the financial markets in South Africa. It is a process that must be applied with caution  and must be supported by other macroeconomic policy measures aimed at improving the international competitiveness of the South African economy. In the area of the financial sector  the authorities must make sure that level playing fields are created for all domestic and non-resident participants in the market. III REGIONAL FINANCIAL CO-OPERATION WITHIN SADC When it formally joined the Southern African Development Community in the second half of 1994  South Africa was given the task of managing the Financial and Investment Protocol for the region. A Sectoral Committee of Ministers of Finance was established within the institutional framework of SADC  and two sub-committees were created  one for Heads of Finance Departments  and a second for Governors of Central Banks. BIS Review 37/1997 - 6 - The Committee of Governors of the Central Banks of SADC met four times during the past eighteen months  finalised a Terms of Reference for its activities  established a Secretariat and Research Unit within the South African Reserve Bank  and agreed on a number of projects and programmes to be implemented. The basic approach of the Committee of Governors has been described as a “bottom-up” approach  where the attention is focused at this stage on financial co-operation amongst  and not integration of  the financial systems of the twelve independent members of SADC. Furthermore  the attention is focused on the development of the internal financial systems of members within a consistent and compatible framework that will pave the way for the co-ordination of macroeconomic monetary policies at some later stage  and perhaps some integration of systems further downstream. The programme of the Governors’ Committee therefore provides for an exchange of information on  and regular discussion of  macroeconomic structures and economic changes in member countries. To facilitate this programme  the Secretariat of the Committee has established within the South African Reserve Bank a computerised data bank for basic financial and economic statistics of each one of the members of SADC. All members will at some stage have direct real-time access to this data base; an exchange of information on the structure  the functions  the responsibilities and the relationships with the government of each one of the twelve participating central banks. For this purpose  the Secretariat of the Committee is busy with the compilation of an information data bank on the participating central banks; a co-ordinated training programme for central bank officials. The South African Reserve Bank Training Institute will this year offer three three-week specialised courses on central banking for officials from SADC central banks; co-ordination of the exchange control policies applied by members of SADC. At least two countries in the region have removed all exchange controls  and many others are in the process of gradually removing remaining controls; a work study on Information Technology (IT) develop-ments within each central bank. The exercise involved in by South Africa to revise is national payment  clearing and settlement system provides an opportunity to plan ahead and consider ways and means of introducing compatible and inter-changeable systems in the region; a concerted approach on efforts to reduce or avoid money laundering and illegal banking activities in the region; and a major initiative to improve the quality of bank supervision and regulation in the region  and to co-ordinate policies on the licensing of banking institutions. This work is undertaken jointly with the East and Southern Africa Banking Supervisors Group (ESAF)  which includes a few more countries than just the SADC configuration. Whilst the work of the Governors’ Committee up to now was more institutionally-centred  more attention will be given in the next phase to the development of the financial markets in the region. There are obviously opportunities for a better utilisation of existing markets in a number of the participating countries in the interest of the whole region. In the third phase  the Committee of Governors will address the macroeconomic needs for the harmonisation of monetary policies such as inflation and interest and exchange rate policies of the member countries. The broad strategy of the SADC Committee of Governors is based on the premise that a sound financial basis must first be laid within the participating countries before it can be extended to the region as a whole. At this stage  the main objective is therefore to learn from each other and to help each other to create appropriate structures for the central bank  the private banking sector and the financial markets in each one of the twelve members of SADC. The domestic financial sector reforms introduced in each country must  however  even at this early stage  take cognisance of the development needs of the region  and the longer-term objective of a more co-ordinated and integrated regional financial sector. This will be the contribution of the BIS Review 37/1997 - 7 - central banks to the expansion of trade and investment  and to improved living conditions for the approximately 130 million people of the region. Finally  the Committee of Governors of SADC as a regional body has a great interest in establishing extended relationships with similar regional central banking forums in the rest of Africa  and other similar initiatives in the Southern African region. IV CONCLUSION The nature of current South African financial sector reforms is dictated by the special circumstances of the country. They may therefore differ substantially from those introduced in other countries. The South African reforms are needed to adapt the financial sector to major internal socio-political reforms  and to accommodate the challenges presented by an enhanced participation in the global financial markets. As far as regional developments are concerned  South Africa welcomes the opportunity of participating more actively through the Southern African Development Community in the development of the financial sector of the African continent. There is a growing need for some closer contact between the various regional financial sector arrangements on the African continent. From the level of financial reforms applied within each one of the more than fifty African countries  through the second tier of regional financial cooperation  the ultimate objective must be to establish a sound  stable and well-functioning financial system in support of economic development in the whole of Africa. Co-ordination on a continental basis of the financial reforms applied within the regions can  perhaps  become an important function of the Economic Commission for Africa  working under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations.

First a word of thanks for the invitation to this evening’s discussion. This is the third year in succession that your Association’s agenda has featured monetary policy. My first introductory talk  in 1995  was about the importance of low inflation and the background to and implications of focusing on price stability. Last year I took up matters to do with monetary policy’s construction and effects  as well as the considerations behind the monetary policy decisions in recent years. This evening I shall be elaborating on those discussions and then deal with monetary policy in the context of Sweden’s high unemployment. Economic developments in Sweden Following the deep recession in the Swedish economy in the early 1990s  we are now in the fourth year of economic expansion. Since 1994 production’s annual growth rate has averaged 2.8 per cent  which is considerably above the trend to which we have been accustomed in recent decades. In 1994 and 1995 the GDP growth rate averaged as much as 3.5 per cent. This increase was concentrated on the internationally oriented sector and industrial activity registered the fastest upswing in a long time. This led to capacity problems despite relatively high investment growth. The strong expansion was therefore not sustainable. Moreover  the credibility of economic policy was impaired by weak central government finance and an unfavourable history of inflation. There was a lack of confidence that the expansionary trend could continue without generating higher inflation. Inflation expectations moved up--more and more people began to count on rising inflation. All this was manifested in  for example  rising long-term interest rates  a weak exchange rate  rising producer prices and accelerating wage increases. The Riksbank therefore tightened interest rate policy  beginning in August 1994. The restrictive turn was criticised in some quarters because inflation had not yet started to accelerate. But our intention was precisely that. If monetary policy measures are taken in time  the inflationary process can be checked before it has taken off. Once inflation has got going  more pronounced monetary policy measures are needed for a return to low inflation. Vigorous efforts have also been made over these years to tackle the central government financial deficit. With its six-monthly control stations  the convergence programme enables people to keep an eye on the political system’s determination to complete the consolidation of the budget and fulfil the goal of balance in 1998. Government representatives have also expressed an ambition to achieve a surplus after that. With the improvement in central government finance  confidence in economic policy grew appreciably and inflation expectations fell back notably in the autumn of 1995 and during 1996. This in turn is a fundamental prerequisite for lastingly stable growth. During 1996 the Riksbank was in a position to reduce the repo rate by degrees to the lowest level for more than thirty years. Towards the end of 1995 the growth of production slackened and the increase during 1996 probably stopped at between 1 and 1.5 per cent. However  the slowdown seems to have been relatively gentle. The demand situation appears to be good  particularly when one BIS Review 38/1997 - 2 - considers that the growth of private sector production was held back by marked destocking in 1996. Stock adjustments are not uncommon after some years of rising output and they do not seem to have had negative effects on private consumption. In the second half of 1996 private consumption picked up and export demand went on rising. As the destocking comes to an end  domestic and international demand should therefore be able to generate an accelerating growth of production this year and in 1988. Considering the economy’s unutilised resources  I do not expect inflationary capacity restrictions to arise in the coming years. If inflation expectations also remain low and confidence in economic policy in general is stable  this  too  will contribute to a subdued development of future inflation. Since the autumn there have been some months in which the level of consumer prices was lower than a year earlier. In a price analysis  however  it is important to distinguish transitory effects on inflation from the underlying inflationary process. In January this year the level of consumer prices was 0.1 per cent lower than a year earlier. Strictly speaking  however  what Sweden is experiencing is not deflation. The falling price level has to do with transitory effects  above all the Riksbank’s marked reduction of the repo rate during 1996. Excluding house mortgage interest costs  the rate of inflation in January 1997 was about 1.5 per cent. The outlook for inflation points to room for a fall in bond rates. Moreover  underlying economic factors suggest that  after the depreciation in recent months  the krona is undervalued and should be capable of appreciating. The present monetary stance appears to be well balanced. After the major changes in the past year  for example in the repo rate  time is needed to assess their effects. Another matter to consider is the recent months’ developments in financial markets. They  too  call for a cautious line in monetary policy. I note that the Swedish economy seems to have made good progress in adjusting to a low inflation regime  with stable  sustained growth. What gives cause for concern  however  is that the recovery of employment appears to be much more sluggish and that unemployment is persistently high. High cost of unemployment As shown in Diagram 1  registered unemployment in Sweden rose sharply in the early 1990s; from a level between 2 and 3 per cent  it shot up to around 8 per cent. This was accompanied by increased participation in labour market programmes. Total unemployment accordingly reached around 13 per cent  an increase of almost 10 percentage points or up to half a million people. This is the highest level since the 1930s. It is primarily among youth that unemployment is high  as shown in Diagram 2. Sweden seems to have landed in much the same situation as many other countries in Europe. High unemployment is associated with grave social problems and large economic costs. Unemployment’s long-run economic costs in terms of GDP can be said to be of BIS Review 38/1997 - 3 - D iagra m 1 D iagra m 1 U n em ploym en t 1965-96 U n em ploym en t 1965-96 per cen t per cen t T ota l R e g is te re d 1 41 4 1 21 2 1 01 0 88 66 44 22 00 6 56 5 7 07 0 7 57 5 8 08 0 8 58 5 9 09 0 9 59 5 S o u rce s : S ta tis tics S we de n a nd N a tio n a l La bo u r M a rke t B o a rd D ia g ra m 2 D ia g ra m 2 A g e-rela ted u n e m p lo y m en t A g e-rela ted u n e m p lo y m en t ra tes ra tes P er c en t P er c en t 1 6 -24 y rs . 2 5 -34 y rs . 1 6 -64 y rs . 2 02 0 1 81 8 1 61 6 1 41 4 1 21 2 1 01 0 88 66 44 22 00 1 41 4 1 21 2 1 01 0 88 66 44 22 00 2 02 0 1 81 8 1 61 6 1 41 4 1 21 2 1 01 0 88 66 44 22 00 77 66 77 77 77 88 77 99 88 00 88 11 88 22 88 33 88 44 88 55 88 66 88 77 88 88 88 99 99 00 99 11 99 22 99 33 99 44 99 55 99 66 S o u rce : S ta tis tics S w e d e n approximately the same magnitude as the unemployment rate.1 Sweden’s increase in unemployment can in this way be estimated to cost around 10 per cent of GDP a year  which is equivalent to SKr 150 billion. Considering the sensitivity of general government finance to variations in unemployment and production  the cost to the public sector  in the form of lower 1Assuming that changes in the capital stock roughly parallel employment and that average productivity is constant. BIS Review 38/1997 - 4 - tax revenue and increased expenditure on unemployment support  for example  may actually be as high as 9 per cent of GDP or SKr 135 billion.2 Conversely  an appreciable reduction of unemployment implies decreased social tensions as well as substantial economic gains. Calculated in the same way  halving registered unemployment from 8 to 4 per cent  for example  would confer an estimated long-term gain in production of 4 per cent of GDP and strengthen government finance by as much as over SKr 50 billion a year. Simple calculations of this type are obviously uncertain but they do serve to illustrate the sort of economic benefits that may be reaped from an appreciable fall in unemployment. What can the Riksbank and monetary policy do? There was a time when many people believed that the problem of very high unemployment could be tackled with a generally expansionary economic policy. Lower interest rates  devaluations or fiscal stimuli were seen as instruments for boosting demand  raising production  improving employment and thereby lowering unemployment. Even today  advocates of similar views are not uncommon. As the consolidation of the budget places constraints on fiscal policy  attention concentrates on monetary policy. Representatives of this line argue that the problem of unemployment could be solved if only the Riksbank had a wider objective than combating inflation. Some say that the Riksbank ought therefore also to have explicit goals for growth  employment and unemployment  goals that should be as important as keeping inflation under control. You will hardly be surprised to hear that I do not share such opinions. The current situation in the labour market is more complicated than that. An expansionary economic policy  aimed at boosting demand above the economy’s long-term production potential  would actually be liable to worsen the labour market situation in the longer run. Inflation would move up and the economy would function less well. Neither is it the case that higher inflation would generate permanently higher employment and lastingly lower unemployment. Let me give you an example. Suppose inflation is 2 per cent initially and monetary policy is given an expansionary turn that disregards the sustainable level of output. If wage agreements have been concluded for a considerable period  an upward shift in inflation to  say  5 per cent could in the best case contribute to a short-run increase in employment because firms’ real wage costs are reduced. In time  however  5 per cent inflation will be perceived as normal and wage demands will be pitched accordingly. With higher nominal wage increases  real wage costs will rise again and unemployment will tend to return to its initial level. A renewed attempt to stimulate employment and reduce unemployment would then entail a further acceleration of inflation from 5 to  say  8 per cent and the procedure would be repeated. Ultimately  all that is achieved is higher average inflation and an economy than functions less efficiently; unemployment stays at its initial level. 2See e.g. Fall  J. (1996)  ""Government finance in a structural perspective""  Sveriges Riksbank Quarterly Review 1996:4. BIS Review 38/1997 - 5 - The level of unemployment to which an economy returns when inflation expectations have been adjusted to actual inflation is usually referred to as equilibrium unemployment. It is immune to monetary policy and determined primarily by structural factors such as demographic changes  technology and the institutional conditions in the labour market. What I have just described is the textbook model for the long-term Phillips curve. The message is that an economy has a path for long-term growth that is determined by underlying  structural factors. Under certain circumstances  fiscal and monetary policy are capable of influencing fluctuations in activity around this trend  though one should not expect to be able to fine-tune demand. A basic idea behind a monetary policy focused on price stability is that the economy is capable of sustained growth along this long-term path. If this path accommodates a rapid increase in production  growth will be high; but if potential output rises slowly  actual growth will be weak even if monetary policy were to be very expansionary and possibly affect the situation temporarily. A very important conclusion from this is that permanently low unemployment cannot be achieved by accepting permanently high inflation. In other words  sustained employment cannot be generated by implementing an expansionary monetary policy and disregarding unemployment’s equilibrium level or the potential level of output. The narrower the gap between actual production and the capacity ceiling and the lower unemployment happens to be in relation to its equilibrium level  the greater will be the risk of higher inflation. From this also follows a need to know whether the equilibrium level of unemployment has risen. If that is the case  measures should be taken specifically to lower the equilibrium level  a task that is outside the scope of monetary policy. Where is unemployment’s equilibrium level? What is unemployment’s current equilibrium level in Sweden? As always when one goes from a theoretical analysis to practical economics  everything becomes much more complex. Unemployment’s equilibrium level is not an observable quantity. One has to make do with estimates and their inevitable uncertainty means that interpretations have to be cautious. The available estimates suggest that equilibrium unemployment in Sweden moved up in the early 1990s and  in terms of registered unemployment  is now somewhere in the interval between 4.5 and 7.5 per cent.3 The OECD also counts on a marked increase in the 1990s; in the latest report on Sweden the current level is put at between 6 and 7 per cent.4 There is not  in fact  complete agreement that equilibrium unemployment has moved up sharply.5 But what suggests that it has  even though we cannot be sure of its exact level  is that otherwise the high unemployment should have acted as a strong restraint on wage formation. The actual development of wages does not indicate this. 3 See e.g. Calmfors  L. (1995)  ""Will high unemployment in Sweden become persistent?""  Swedish Economic Policy Review  vol. 2  No. 1. 4 Economic Surveys - Sweden 1997  OECD  Paris. 5 See e.g. Åberg  R. jämviktsarbetslöshet huvudproblemet på arbetsmarknaden?"" (Is rising equilibrium unemployment the main problem in the labour market?)  Ekonomisk Debatt  25:1. ""Är stigande (1997)  BIS Review 38/1997 - 6 - It therefore has to be concluded that unemployment cannot be lowered appreciably by monetary policy alone. Most economic observers also consider that even with decent growth in the coming years  unemployment will remain high. A lasting return just to something resembling the unemployment figures we have been accustomed to in Sweden therefore requires a proper discussion of which measures are needed to bring equilibrium unemployment down. The picture in the USA  Western Europe and Sweden It is not just in Sweden that unemployment is high. This is something which is leaving its mark on virtually the whole of the EU area. Moreover  the level of European unemployment has been high during most of the 1980s. In the United States  on the other hand  unemployment has fluctuated around 6 per cent for the past quarter century without any upward trend. The direct explanation for the difference between the EU area and the United States is the appreciably faster growth of employment over there. In the past quarter century and more  employment in the United States has risen over 60 per cent as against only 15 per cent in the EU area. The number of new jobs certainly grew by some one per cent in Europe when activity was recovering but almost as many jobs disappeared in the downturns. In the United States  on the other hand  over the business cycle there have been net increases. Economists differ as to the underlying causes. For some economists  equilibrium unemployment has moved up on account of underlying structural factors. One hypothesis  put forward by  among others  the American economist Paul Krugman  is that certain categories of labour (low educated  for example) are having increasing difficulty in competing in the labour market.6 This is mainly bound up with a technology that replaces manual labour with machines but presumably it also has to do with increased competition from countries where wage levels are considerably lower. It is often pointed out that the effects of this are countered by a wider wage spread that in turn has stimulated an expansion of the private services sector. Employment has therefore risen rapidly in the United States. In Europe  on the other hand  the result has been increased unemployment; the labour market and wage formation here have not permitted the same development as in the United States. A similar effect  leading to a stronger employment trend  may have come from a lower average real wage rise in the United States compared with Europe. The steep real wage increase in the EU area has favoured capital-intensive sectors and stimulated the use of capital-intensive technology. At the same time  low-productivity enterprises have shrunk or closed down. This has shown up in increased productivity and weakly rising employment. The opposite has occurred in the United States: sluggish real wages have limited the need to rationalise labour and invest in capital-intensive equipment and this has resulted in rapidly rising employment.7 6 Krugman  P.

One of the few countries here that has managed to turn the employment curve upwards from the mid-1980s is the Netherlands  as shown in Diagram 3b. In the course of a decade unemployment has been virtually halved  from 12 to just over 6 per cent. One factor behind this is a very moderate real wage rise  so that employment has risen on this account. The labour market has probably become more adaptable. Another phenomenon in the Netherlands is an increase in part-time employment; this probably reflects a change in labour demand but also a shift in supply. The case of the Netherlands shows that the employment trend can be turned. This indicates  in my opinion  that in the current discussion in Sweden about a new model for wage formation  the prototype ought not to be Europe as a whole. If the average real wage rise in Sweden were to match the rate observed in Europe in the past quarter-century  it might make a reduction of unemployment more difficult. The model should rather be the Netherlands. The pattern in Sweden resembles that for the EU area. In the period as a whole employment has hardly changed. As in Europe in general  real wages have risen relatively strongly  though the trend has been held back by a series of devaluations that pushed inflation up  presumably with a negative effect on production.

This is the trend that must be broken. While there has certainly been some increase in employment in boom years  in the subsequent downturns virtually as many jobs have BIS Review 38/1997 - 9 - disappeared. The overall increase in employment has come from an expansion of public sector jobs; one million jobs were created in this sector between 1960 and 1990. Now that  for various reasons  the political system has been obliged to arrest the public sector’s expansion  employment has also fallen.

Therefore it is not high demand generated by a more expansionary monetary and fiscal policy that can account for the creation of so many new jobs in the United States or  in the past decade  in the Netherlands. This is an indication that structural factors lie behind the development in Western Europe as a whole. An important part seems to be played  not least  by wage formation. The weak growth in Sweden is also evident from Diagram 5. This is another interesting observation in the present context. When potential output rises slowly for structural reasons  growth will be weak even if economic policy is expansionary. In spite of devaluations and fiscal expansion with a view to boosting demand  growth has remained lower than in many other industrialised countries. This is an important lesson to bear in mind when discussing monetary policy’s functions and tasks. Other economists have been less interested in why employment has been slack and unemployment has risen and more concerned with unemployment’s tendency to remain at a high level. The observation that unemployment  having risen  tends to stick at a high level or falls back to normal levels only gradually is usually described in terms of hysteresis and BIS Review 38/1997 - 10 - persistence.8 An explanation for the occurrence of persistence tendencies is provided by the insider-outsider model. Briefly  an increase in unemployment does not lead to wage restraint because those who have lost the jobs--the outsiders--exercise no influence on wage setting. Instead of a restrained wage rise  with lower labour costs and a possibility of taking on additional labour  the wage increases remain high and the outsiders remain out of work.9 Strictly speaking  this does not constitute an increase in equilibrium unemployment but it still amounts to unemployment that is more or less permanent. In Sweden  wage increases tended to accelerate in the 1995 round of settlements even though unemployment was high. Statements by representatives of labour market organisations are indicative of a propensity to give real wage increases priority over increased employment. Allow me to cite (from Finanstidningen  14th October 1996): “There is no direct link between our coming wage claims and the number who are unemployed”. This is an illustration of the theories about insiders and outsiders in the labour market. The costs of hiring and firing labour are one source of insiders’ influence over wage formation  which can affect the possibility of bringing unemployment down. During the latest economic upswing in Sweden the number of hours worked rose by the equivalent of 130 000 new jobs but the increase in the number of persons in employment stopped at 85 000. The direct explanation is that average working time lengthened  which naturally may have reflected a rising propensity to go from part-time to full-time work and to do overtime in order to ease a strained personal economy. But it is also conceivable that employers have become less inclined to hire additional labour and more prone to make greater use of the existing labour force to cope with rising demand. An indication of this could be employers’ willingness to introduce working hours related to the activity in the economy. The differences between the explanatory models should not be exaggerated. They have several features in common and this makes them difficult to separate clearly in practice. Most of the evidence suggests that the high equilibrium unemployment in Western Europe as well as in Sweden has several causes. As the structures and institutions in the Swedish labour market resemble those in the rest of Western Europe in many respects  it is reasonable to suppose that the same forces have been at work in our country but that their impact and importance were concealed for a long time by an expansionary economic policy that was ultimately unsustainable. High and more or less permanent unemployment  or high equilibrium unemployment  is a sign that the labour market is functioning poorly. These problems are rooted in turn in wage developments because it is price formation which is the central market mechanism. Conclusion The best way in which monetary policy can contribute to an economy that functions better economy with employment and growth is by keeping inflation low and stable. 8 Björklund  A.

BIS Review 38/1997 - 11 - The economy can then expand along its long-term growth trend. If this path  which is determined by structural factors  permits a rapid increase in output  growth will then be high. If potential output rises slowly  on the other hand  economic growth will be weak even if monetary policy were to be very expansionary. Most things suggest that traditional demand policy is not capable of lowering unemployment appreciably. Most economic observers also expect that even with decent growth  unemployment will remain high in the coming years. Whatever the causes of the high unemployment  an important key to turning this tendency lies in the functioning of the labour market. I have not considered conceivable specific measures  such as stimulating private sector employment  contributing to efficient wage formation and encouraging individuals to look for and accept jobs and maintain and develop their competence. I believe that  as Assar Lindbeck pointed out recently 10 the problem of unemployment in Sweden and  indeed  in the whole of Western Europe has to do with a great many factors connected with how the labour market functions. Although the most effective measures cannot be identified for certain in advance  the central concern is the workings of the labour market and thereby also the labour market organisations. This applies to employer and employee representatives alike. The climate in the labour market will be of significance for the possibility of bringing the high unemployment down. One issue is whether a mood of mutual understanding can be created so that employment has priority in wage setting. An important lesson seems to be that Sweden ought not to opt for a standard in wage formation that matches the average level in Western Europe; such a relatively high level could impede a reduction of unemployment. The model should rather be the Netherlands. Another issue is whether a mood of mutual understanding can be created about the reform and construction of labour market rules and other measures that can help to reduce unemployment. My intention this evening has not been to present a deeper analysis of the labour market problems  nor to answer questions about what needs to be done. But perhaps I have contributed by raising some of the questions that need to be answered and by defining the function of monetary policy and what it can do. If we are to achieve a lasting return just to something resembling the unemployment figures we have been accustomed to in Sweden  there will have to be a proper discussion of which measures are needed to bring unemployment down. 10 See note 7.

Antonio Fazio  before the Chambre of Commerce of the Senate of the Italian Republic in Rome on 25/2/97.,Mr. Fazio discusses the current situation as regards the prevention and repression of money laundering in the financial system in Italy Statement by the Governor of the Bank of Italy  Dott. Antonio Fazio  before the Chambre of Commerce of the Senate of the Italian Republic in Rome on 25/2/97. In my statement to this Committee in October 1994 I focused on the new legal framework for finance and credit  the role of the supervisory authorities and intermediaries in combatting illegal activities  and cooperation with the governmental authorities directly involved in the fight against organized crime. In the last two years the broad context has changed and evolved. Progress has been made in developing the analysis of financial offences  instruments for preventing and repressing them. The investment services Directive has been transposed; the law against usury has been approved. The cooperation between the Bank of Italy  intermediaries and law enforcement and judicial authorities has been further strengthened. 1. Adverse effects of criminal activity and money laundering on the economy and finance My contribution today takes account of the experience of the Bank of Italy and that of the UIC; since 1991 the latter has been entrusted by law with special tasks in the anti- money-laundering field. The repercussions of criminal activity on the economy and finance involve the supervisory function of the central bank and its responsibility for safeguarding monetary stability. Money is a typically and purely fiduciary value. It is indispensable that citizens should be aware that the State  through its institutions  guarantees the security and prompt execution of exchanges; financial enterprises must be able to operate in an efficient  correct and transparent manner. In the first place it is necessary to prevent financial resources of illicit origin from entering the legitimate economy through the creation of new intermediaries or the acquisition of existing ones. Analogous  and equally serious  problems  exist in other sectors  notably the distributive trades. It is necessary to ensure that illicit resources cannot influence the ordinary course of financial intermediation. The proper functioning of the market requires compliance with fundamental ethical rules. Correct behaviour is an economic value in itself; it enhances the strength and security of economic agents. The existence of economic agents and structures in collusion with organized crime profoundly modifies the mechanisms of the market with respect to rules and objectives  distorts competition. The gap between the level of economic development in the various regions of Italy is due to a considerable extent to inadequate economic and social infrastructure; shortcomings in the public administration and the slowness of the judicial system are other contributory factors. Organized crime exploits the situation of underemployment in the depressed areas; to the socially weaker members of the community it appears as an economic force and even as a system of values  which undermines ethical principles and social solidarity. It is possible to attack criminal organizations in the phase of infiltrating money into the legal financial circuits. This task is the responsibility of the law enforcement authorities and those entrusted with the control of the financial system; it requires full and convinced support on the part of agents and intermediaries. The supervisory authorities of the leading industrial countries are aware of the threat to the integrity and stability of intermediaries posed by illicit capital. Increasing efforts are BIS Review 39/1997 - 2 - being made to prepare weapons and defences with which to prevent contagion by criminal activities and the related instability of financial systems. 2. The international dimension of the money laundering problem The removal of the restrictions and controls on capital movements and the emergence of a global market for credit  foreign exchange and securities have undoubtedly facilitated the international laundering of the proceeds of criminal activities. The size of the phenomenon is difficult to gauge  but certainly considerable. The authorities of the leading countries have defined a set of measures that should be embodied in all their legal systems in order to make prevention and repression more effective. The aim is to achieve uniform behaviour in the face of the phenomenon. The recommendations of the international Financial Task Force set up within the Group of Seven and Community Directive 1991/308 contain clear guidelines and prescriptions  especially for EU countries. International organizations are seeking to take more direct steps  in the first place with respect to countries that appear reluctant to introduce anti-money-laundering provisions into their legal systems. The effectiveness of such provisions is reduced by the tolerant attitude towards money laundering in some countries  the so-called off shore centres  a classification that stretches to include independent territories and states in various continents. The protection offered by banking secrecy that is impenetrable even for criminal investigators  shortcomings in legislation or the lack thereof  problems in cooperating with local judicial authorities and difficulty in supervising intermediaries make it particularly easy in some financial centres to launder money of illicit origin. In the case of branches and subsidiaries of international banks located in such centres  the controls of the parent bank and the supervisory authorities are sometimes made impossible or at any rate difficult. Since 1992 the Bank of Italy has adopted a restrictive stance to Italian banks setting up establishments in some off-shore centres; no new establishments have been authorized. In this field the Italian regulatory framework reflects the progress made by the agreements among the Group of Ten countries. The choice of such financial centres for the laundering of illicit proceeds is also due to factors that in any case attract financial resources and intermediaries  including particularly favourable tax regimes. The use of electronic money in all its various forms has attracted the attention of supervisory authorities to the vulnerable points these new instruments introduce into the system of defence against money laundering. The nature  speed and volume of transactions tend to hinder the detection and reconstruction of anomalous financial operations. The greatest concern arises in connection with the issue of electronic money by financial businesses not subject to supervision. Awareness of the seriousness of the problems has stimulated the renewed drive by the international community to react in several directions with measures aimed at fighting the circulation of funds deriving from criminal activities at the level of supervision and tax harmonization. One route to limit the flows of dirty money towards lax financial centres is to require the financial institutions of countries where legislation is adequate to report transactions lacking an obvious licit economic motive in which the counterparty is located in a country with inadequate defences. The top priority must be to improve the quality of supervision and the reliability of financial intermediaries. Steps are being taken in this direction by the Basle Banking BIS Review 39/1997 Supervision Committee  which is working to promote the adoption of minimum standards in the emerging countries. The problem of tax harmonization in Europe and the OECD countries remains highly topical. It has been raised on several occasions in the Group of Seven and the European Union and there appears to be renewed recognition of its importance on the part of the leading countries. The OECD is carrying out analyses  but progress is slow and laborious. The Republic of San Marino introduced a number of statutory provisions on money laundering in the spring of 1996. A bilateral committee is currently evaluating the degree of conformity with EU and Italian standards. 3. Illegal finance and usury In Italy  despite the large increase in the number of bank branches  there continues to be a far from negligible area of unauthorized financial activity  in terms of both lending and fund-raising. Usury feeds on this situation and is a cause for alarm. As I had occasion to point out in my concluding remarks to the Bank’s general meeting on 31 May 1996  usury is a complex phenomenon and first and foremost a problem of public order. Usury preys on households  as well as small commercial and artisan businesses  which more often than not are no longer considered creditworthy. It often provides the means for organized crime to infiltrate the legitimate productive economy. The present difficult phase that the economy is passing through increases the risk of the phenomenon spreading. Banks  especially local and cooperative banks  have been spurred by the Bank of Italy to pay increased attention to the needs of smaller firms and guide them towards appropriate forms of financial planning. Numerous initiatives are designed to simplify dealings with customers and speed up decisions on loan applications. In this respect the code of conduct prepared by the Italian Bankers’ Association (ABI) and the protocols between intermediaries and local businessmen’s associations are of particular importance. Funds have been earmarked by some large banks for the financing of persons in temporary difficulty and consequently exposed to the risk of usury. These funds supplement those of a public nature provided for in the new law for purposes of prevention and solidarity  which will be activated this year. In the background there remains the need to educate households and firms to use money and financing responsibly. Prevention calls for full awareness of the dangers of borrowing from illegal sources of finance. The new law on usury appears to be appropriately based on an overall view of the phenomenon. There nonetheless remain causes for concern  as has been frequently pointed out  concerning the possible adverse consequences of introducing “threshold rate” for regulated intermediaries. As I put it on another occasion  “The specification of a usurious rate of interest is intended to provide an objective yardstick for determining the existence of a crime. The limits established and their application to regulated intermediaries may push up interest rates for smaller loans  lead to the rationing of credit to marginal  weaker customers.” The Bank of Italy and the UIC are engaged in the complex task of gathering data on the interest rates charged by banks and other financial intermediaries for different size classes and types of loans. A start has been made on analysing the information collected with a view to the publication of the related ministerial decree. The Bank of Italy and the UIC are committed to providing the support needed to ensure a correct understanding and use of the data gathered. The law requires every form of financial intermediation to be inserted in a predetermined legal framework. The territorial control entrusted to governmental authorities  including the Bank of Italy for the matters assigned to it  is of fundamental importance. BIS Review 39/1997 - 4 - Banks that learn of the existence of unauthorized organizations notify the Bank of Italy. In turn the Bank provides feedback for the purpose of prevention and informs the competent authorities. More decisive steps have been taken to forestall and punish improper behaviour by employees of financial intermediaries. Safeguards have been introduced to protect against false representations to banks and breach of trust in the management of securities portfolios with the aim of contributing to the regularity and transparency of dealings between intermediaries and their customers. 4. The activity of the Bank of Italy in preventing and repressing money laundering Even unwitting involvement by an intermediary in circulating money of illicit provenance will undermine its sound and prudent management in the end. A particularly delicate moment is the market-entry of new intermediaries  especially the opening of new banks. The Bank of Italy’s Supervision Department carries out controls on market entry; in particular  it examines ownership structure and organizational arrangements  and verifies compliance with the integrity and experience requirements for corporate officers. In the three years 1994-96  75 applications to open new banks were considered and 57 approved; of the 18 non-approvals  16 concerned Southern Italy. Authorization was denied on account of the presence of corporate officers or owners who could not be trusted for the purposes of sound and prudent management and  in some instances  were suspected of collusion with organized crime. These decisions were upheld in administrative appeal proceedings. Supervisory action is performed continuously through documentary control of the operational indicators and frequent meetings with banks’ officers. On-site verifications are carried out regularly and systematically. These inspections supplement the documentary controls and are designed to assess banks’ ability to engage in the collection and investment of savings in a correct manner  in accordance with criteria of sound and prudent management and all the legal requirements. Inspections are not specifically designed to discover possible violations of criminal law. If a case of irregular conduct is found  its technical and legal aspects are carefully examined. Cases that may constitute crimes are resorted to the judicial authorities. For its own aims of banking and financial supervision  the Bank of Italy has conducted 563 inspections in the last three years. Sixty per cent of Italy’s banks were examined - 68 per cent of all those established in the South and 57 per cent of those in the Centre and North. Following a number of these inspections the Bank of Italy submitted proposals to the Treasury Minister for the adoption of disciplinary measures for serious operational irregularities involving large capital losses. In particular  25 banks were put into special administration  which entails the dissolution of their boards of directors and auditors. Fifteen banks were put into compulsory administrative liquidation. The penal proceedings now under way will clarify whether there were instances of money laundering or collusion with criminal organizations. The Bank submitted proposals to the Minister for pecuniary sanctions to be levied against 2 779 officers of more than 200 intermediaries. The anti-laundering rules - Law 197/1997 - rely on the faithful collaboration of intermediaries. This takes the form of preparing a “trail” of the transactions they have effected  for use in possible investigations  and of reporting on any suspicions provoked by specific transactions on the technical and financial plane. The rules: BIS Review 39/1997 set limits to the use of cash  • prohibit the making of payments by unauthorized intermediaries  • require the identification of customers and the registration of significant transactions  and • make it compulsory to report suspicious transactions. The regular performance of credit and financial activity depends on intermediaries’ having adequate information on every customer. To assist in the identification of suspicious transactions  the Bank of Italy has published a “decalogue” systematically setting out examples of anomalies whose presence requires the various aspects of the transaction to be scrutinzied and  possibly  a report to be filed. Intermediaries are required to consider the objective features of a transaction and to compare them with the characteristics of the person making it in order to detect possible anomalies. Standardized schemas cannot take the place of careful transaction analysis and assessment by intermediaries’ employees. The law calls for this kind of evaluation. The difficulties initially encountered by the financial system are being overcome and the flow of reports has increased considerably. In 1996 the Finance Police received 3 075 reports  most of them from banks. There is growing understanding and support for the law’s objectives among intermediaries and operators. It remains necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the procedure and  for reasons of personal safety  the anonymity of the persons making reports. 5. The activity of the UIC The UlC’s essential  traditional tasks are the management of the foreign reserves and the collection and processing of the statistics needed to compile Italy’s balance of payments and the related publications. In 1991 Law 197 assigned the UIC a central role in administrative action to combat money laundering. The UIC  in agreement with the competent supervisory authorities  verifies intermediaries’ compliance with the anti-laundering rules  keeps the register of companies in the financial sector  and does statistical studies using the aggregated data drawn from the databases of authorized intermediaries. There were 21 318 financial companies in the register at the end of last year. Only 1 604 of them did business with the public; the rest were groups’ dedicated financial companies (the great majority) or loan underwriting consortia. In 1996 the UIC issued some 500 notices to companies regarding initial or subsequent failure to satisfy the requirements for entry in the register or findings of serious violations of law. Among companies that do business with the public  which are potentially more exposed to the risk of being used for illicit purposes  there were 120 deletions from the register and 72 new listings. For the financial sector as a whole  in the three years from 1994 to 1996 there were 3.803 de-listings and 1 571 new listings. In 1995 a survey was made of all the banks’ computerized data collection and database management procedures. By the end of 1996 72 inspections aimed at verifying compliance with the anti- laundering rules had been completed: these led to 40 reports being sent to the judicial authorities and 36 to the Treasury Minister for administrative infractions. The main deficiencies found during the inspections were attributable primarily to organizational problems involving computerized procedures and inadequate internal controls. The UIC is charged with monitoring the aggregated data originating from the company’s single databases  with a view to bringing out anomalies that may signal money laundering. The anomalies are detected from among the mass of available data on the basis of a grid of essentially statistical criteria. BIS Review 39/1997 - 6 - Data are collected from 2 000 authorized intermediaries. The number of operations subject to aggregation is more than 30 million a month  including some 10 million cash transactions. This is a completely new field  and not just in Italy  and the UIC  in contact with leading research centres  has begun to experiment in depth with new methodologies designed to detect anomalous financial flows. Once the initial results are available the UIC will provide the competent bodies with indications that can be used in investigative activity. Careful methodological consideration has brought out the need for a deeper scientific analysis of the nature and manner of the links between the economy and organized crime. Representatives of the police forces and the judiciary  together with academic specialists  are collaborating with the newly formed “Anti-Money-Laundering Observatory”. For now this body is strictly informal. It is a research facility established to investigate key aspects of the economy  organized crime and money laundering in particular  with a view to keeping preventive strategies abreast of the evolution of criminal techniques and the spread of the phenomenon to new sectors. 6. Collaboration with the judicial authorities In the last three years the Supervision Department has sent reports on 92 intermediaries to the criminal justice authorities. A steadily growing number of requests for data and technical information are being addressed to the Bank of Italy. Around 1 000 requests for information and documentation have been handled  and officers of the Bank have testified in 185 cases. Experts of the Bank of Italy and the UIC are increasingly engaged in technical advisory tasks: one fifth of the staff of the Central Supervision Inspectorate  that is to say some 30 officers  are assigned to such duties full-time. Major assistance is provided to the judicial and investigating authorities in examining aspects of the various types of money laundering and for refresher courses on technical points of the phenomena that may come under investigation. There is intense collaboration with the law-enforcement agencies  especially the Finance Police  and with the Racket and Usury Bureau. The Bureau of Antimafia Investigation is kept up to date on serious management irregularities found at intermediaries operating in the regions most affected by organized crime. Contacts are under way to develop collaboration with the National Antimafia Bureau  for a better knowledge of money laundering techniques and for the exchange of information. Under the legislation in force  the judicial authorities inform the Governor of the Bank of Italy  for the initiatives within his sphere of competence  when there is good reason to think that banks are involved in money laundering Cases of possible fraud or money laundering connected with foreign undertakings established in countries which lack reliable controls are more and more frequently coming to the central bank’s attention. These are the subject of exchanges of information with domestic and foreign authorities. 7. The new shape of anti-money-laundering legislation The current provisions against money laundering are not yet the outcome of systematic legislative intervention corresponding to a single logic. They are the result of accretion over time  as was underscored in the chapter of the Bank’s 1995 Annual Report on supervisory activity. According to the Financial Action Task Force  the only deficiencies in the rules adopted in Italy are lack of full confidentiality of reports and failure to provide for a body that centralizes reports. The active collaboration requested of intermediaries is not protected by BIS Review 39/1997 adequate safeguards for secrecy in reporting suspicious transactions. This entails obvious dangers for the safety of operators and creates obstacles to unreserved collaboration. The occasion for rectifying these deficiencies is the delegation of legislative power under Article 15 of Law 52 of 6 February 1996  which establishes the criteria for completing the transposition into Italian law of Community Directive 308/1991 concerning measures to combat money laundering. Although the Directive takes the approach that laundering must be fought primarily with penal instruments  it underscores the fundamental role of collaboration by the financial system and the supervisory authorities. Policymaking in the fight against money laundering is a prerogative of the Government. From a strategic point of view  the matter is essentially financial  and so it is natural for the central role to be entrusted to the Treasury Minister. According to the orientations that are emerging  the basic approach is  correctly  to keep the realm of financial controls distinct from that of investigative activity while ensuring the necessary coordination. The UIC would be made responsible for financial analysis and administrative control for the prevention of money laundering  to capitalize on the financial system’s expertise in the fight against laundering. The solution respects the distinction between administrative and investigative activity. There must be no mingling of these roles. Reports of suspicious transactions would be routed through the UIC  which would subject them to technical examination and supplement the information with the aid of the sectoral supervisory authorities  for the purpose of immediate transmission to the law- enforcement authorities. The confidentiality of sources would be safeguarded even during an ensuing criminal investigation. The same logic of coordination between different functions would be affirmed with regard to the significant findings of the statistical studies performed by the UIC. The drafting of the codified law provided for by Law 52/1996 will make it possible to put prevention before repression and to restrict penal sanctions to conduct that is actually deviant with respect to standard operating practice. It is also necessary to specify other activities to which the anti-laundering requirements should be extended. These include security courier services  debt collection services and even some professional activities that are involved in various types of circulation of wealth in the form of securities and real estate. Honourable Members of Parliament  The acquisition by organized crime of instruments serving to control finance is an especially serious matter in that it can become a sort of multiplier of the criminals’ strength and of the resulting contamination of the economy. As far as the creation of new banks or the acquisition of existing ones is concerned  we are fully confident in the efficacy of prevention. Intercepting illicit capital during ordinary operations appears more problematic. As a rule  criminals cannot avoid using the normal financial channels  and the payment and funds transfer system operated by the banks is a natural conduit for funds of illegal provenance. These are a very small share of the total funds handled by the banks  so that identifying them is difficult in several respects. The collaboration of intermediaries and of their operating staff is all-important. Reports of suspicious cases are on the rise. Those who file reports have to have greater assurances as to their safety and protection. Transfers of funds linked to illegal activities are becoming substantial in terms of absolute value and are tending to concentrate in particular regions  areas and intermediaries. Statistically-based studies are being conducted at the UIC  with promising results  to identify “clusters” of illicit capital that tend to move systematically from particular areas to others. BIS Review 39/1997 - 8 - The Italian banking system is fully aware of the need for an unflagging effort to detect and eliminate these pathological phenomena and to accept the costs involved. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has recognized the adequacy of Italy’s legislation. It is necessary for the international community to avoid any tolerance  even tacit  for those financial centres and international banks that for profit-seeking motives operate in conditions of less-than-perfect transparency. Such attitudes subvert the rules of correct competition and  through the circulation of money of illegal provenance  the international economic order itself. There must be growing awareness  extending beyond the circle of advanced countries  of the grave threat that the spread of criminal economic activity poses to the benefits of trade and financial liberalization. The Bank of Italy and the UIC remain actively committed at the side of the governmental authorities in providing the necessary collaboration to prevent and combat financial crime  for the good of our nation and of the international community.

Meyer  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the seventh annual Conference on Financial Structure in Annandale-on-Hudson  New York  on 10/4/97. It is my pleasure to take part in what has become an important annual meeting on financial policy issues. It is my job to get you warmed up for a reception and dinner. Our hosts have a curious view that a discussion of financial modernization will whet your appetite for food. Maybe so  but it will almost surely increase your thirst. It seems that people have been talking about financial modernization for a long time. Indeed  in the short-run it is easy to become discouraged about how often we talk  but how rarely we do anything  about financial modernization. However  if we step back and look over the last twenty years  it seems to me remarkable both how much progress has been achieved and how much the concerns of financial modernization have changed. Two decades ago we still had Regulation Q  the Glass-Steagall Act was widely viewed as requiring a virtual prohibition of combinations of commercial and investment banking  interstate banking and branching were barely fantasies even at the state level  and combinations of banking and insurance were off most people’s radar screens. Today  many of the issues of 20 years ago have  blessedly  been resolved. But some remain  and new ones have inevitably appeared. The contemporary concerns of financial modernization include repeal of Glass-Steagall  expanded insurance activities for banking firms  the entry of insurance and securities firms into banking  the possibility of unlimited mixing of banking and commerce  and ongoing technological changes and financial innovations. Tonight I would like to address some aspects of these concerns. I will suggest to you that while financial modernization is still  as it was twenty years ago  a necessity  it is also the case that in an uncertain world characterized by rapid change caution is not a dirty word. I will begin with what for me is the easiest topic: banking and commerce. The separation of banking and commerce has a long history in English-speaking countries. Indeed  the policy can be traced back to the founding of the Bank of England in 1694. It appears that commercial firms were concerned that the Bank’s monetary powers would give it a competitive advantage in mercantile activities if there were no separation of banking and commerce. The young American state governments adopted  at least in principle  this separation of banking and commerce. However  from the beginning the separation of banking and commerce was hardly complete in the U.S. banking system. State governments often saw the granting of bank charters as a way of encouraging capital intensive development projects. As a result  pre-Civil War banks were sometimes engaged in such activities as canal building  railroad construction  and even the development of public water systems. Thus  from early on the mixing of banking and commerce was a gray area in the United States. This tradition continues to this day. For example  the same individual can own a controlling share of both banking and commercial firms. Perhaps of more interest  a bank holding company may acquire up to 5 percent of the voting shares of any commercial enterprise  as long as the investment does not represent a controlling interest. In addition  the Board has permitted passive investments in commercial firms of up to 25 percent of nonvoting shares  and an investment can be as high as 49 percent if it is made through a small business investment company. Bank holding companies can own 100 percent of the equity of a small business investment company. BIS Review 40/1997 - 2 - We could all continue to give many examples  including the ownership of unitary thrifts and specialized  and not-so-specialized  finance companies by commercial firms. Indeed  some observers use these examples to argue that since the United States already has so much mixing of banking and commerce  why not go all the way? In my view  such arguments exaggerate the reality. Despite all the gray areas  I think it is fair to say that to a very substantial extent banking and commerce are essentially separate activities in the United States. Thus  we need to think carefully about whether we want to go even further down the road of combining banking with nonfinancial activities. Advocates of unrestricted mixing of banking and commerce make at least four arguments: (1) both banking and commercial firms could more easily diversify their risks  (2) a closely related argument is that such combinations would provide opportunities for synergies in cross-selling  (3) combining banking and commerce could lead to more capital in the banking industry  and (4) mixing banking and commerce would help to solve certain asymmetric information and corporate control problems associated with commercial lending. Time does not permit me to address each of these in detail. Suffice it to say that I find each of them wanting. I can find very little  if any  in our experience as a nation that gives me real confidence about the benefits of combining banking and commerce. And I can find no empirical support for any benefits for combining banking and commerce based on experience abroad. Take risk diversification. Do we really believe that in the day of stock index mutual funds  options on individual stocks  and evolving credit derivatives that any firm must own another in order to diversify its risks in virtually any way it cares to do so? I think not. If diversification of asset return risk were our only goal  financial modernization would be easy. How about synergies in cross- selling? Maybe. But I think we must be skeptical here  because the admittedly weak literature on economies of scope in banking has been hard pressed to find strong evidence of significant synergies even in financial activities  although I think we all believe that there are some. The argument that we need to combine banking and commerce to attract capital to banking seems  well  pretty silly. In a market economy  capital flows to profit opportunities. If banking is viewed as a vibrant and growing industry  it is hard to see why capital will be a problem. Indeed  the banking industry just completed its fifth straight year of record profits  and it is no coincidence that by all measures capital has been flowing into the industry. If it were not profitable  I cannot see why we would want to create a structure to attract capital to banking. The notion that mixing banking and commerce would reduce information costs in bank lending  and would facilitate monitoring and management control by the bank probably has some merit. Banks that hold both a debt and equity stake in a firm would probably be better able to deter excessive risk taking by the other equity holders  and might even have access to better information about the firm. However  the internalization of these principal-agent problems would come at a price: a price that could include less vibrant money and capital markets  an unwarranted expansion of the federal safety net  potentially dangerous conflicts of interest  and excessive concentration of power. On balance  in my view  this is an area where we should be very cautious and where we need far more research before we can come to any definitive conclusions. An additional reason for caution is the necessity of modifying supervisory techniques. I believe that all of the banking agencies can meet the challenges of expanded financial activities. But adding commercial firms before we have digested the financial side of the business could well be a bridge too far. Indeed  I believe that prudent public policy requires that  for this reason alone  we get financial activities right before tackling further combinations of banking and commerce. The thorny banking and commerce problem in financial modernization is that nonbanking financial firms are already affiliated with commercial firms: some from commercial firms BIS Review 40/1997 - 3 - creating financial subsidiaries  some from financial firms acquiring nonfinancial businesses. If financial modernization allows all financial firms to affiliate  but prohibits banking and commerce  the pre-existing commercial affiliates of nonbank financial firms would have to be divested to acquire a bank  while banks could enter de novo the new nonbank financial activity without divesting any valuable assets. This is either inequitable or the cost of acquiring a bank  depending on your point of view. But  it is clearly a problem that has to be addressed. The choices are divestiture  grandfathering  long-term phase outs  basket clauses  or combining of banking and commerce. It would seem to me a poor public policy that opened up banking and commerce on pure equity grounds  rather than a disinterested analysis of societal net benefits. The Impact of Technological Change on Bank Risk Management A strong case can be made for focussing bank reform today on the expansion of permissible financial activities. The prohibitions against banking and securities and banking and insurance combinations have always  it seems to me  been difficult to support. Moreover  technological change has simply undermined the traditional distinctions among financial products and services. In a word  the existing prohibitions are anachronistic. One thing has remained consistent: Banks are in the business of taking and managing risk  have always been and always will be. The change that we must cope with is that technology has changed the ways they take risk  while at the same time improving their capability for managing it. This creation and management of risk  like much of recent economic change  would have been impossible without the dramatically lower cost of a unit of computing power. Indeed  before the computer  most of the new bank products of recent years were merely concepts  concepts that could not become operational until they were quantifiable. That’s what the computer facilitated: quantification of risk  the necessary prerequisite to price it accurately and manage it effectively. Quantification did not change the fact that banks continue to deal with two very old- fashioned risks: credit risk--will the counterparty perform as promised?--and market risk--will changes in interest rates or other market factors reduce the value of my portfolio? Indeed  the special skills of banks in evaluating and taking credit and market risk is what banks have leveraged in taking part in the financial revolution spawned by the technical revolution. Nonetheless  the nature of the newer products and the relationship with counterparties have meant that risks now manifest themselves in a different way and that banks can modify their risk exposures much more rapidly than ever. Technology and the enhanced ability to capture and use data have changed risk taking and its management in several areas: securitization  credit scoring  and modeling for pricing and capital allocation  to name three. But no finer example of the revolutionary changes made possible by technology can be found than derivatives. Banks and other creators of derivatives can now slice and dice risks associated with a wide spectrum of underlying assets. Derivatives can be used to hedge risk for the bank or its customers. Examples include interest rate swaps designed to make counterparties more comfortable with their interest rate exposures and credit derivatives designed to reduce correlations of risk in a loan portfolio. Of course  either of these instruments can be used to take risk if the holder opts to hold the uncovered exposure  avoiding the cost of acquiring the underlying assets. Moreover  a bank can change its position quickly--limiting a loss  diversifying or hedging a risk  or closing out a position. Derivatives  of course  do more than allow the taking or hedging of risk. They also permit the holders to combine and separate risks to mimic virtually any financial activity. They thus limit what regulators can prohibit  blur distinctions between instruments regulated by different regulators  and virtually eliminate functional and other distinctions among commercial banks  investment banks  insurance companies  and other financial institutions. BIS Review 40/1997 - 4 - Supervising the Future Financial Services Holding Company When it comes to considering how technology and new products have affected supervision--especially of the future financial services holding company  with its wider powers--I must begin by repeating an earlier comment: Banking organizations are still in the risk business-- taking it  managing it  profiting from it  and when they make the wrong decision or have bad luck  bearing losses and perhaps even failing. And the basic risks still are credit and market risks. The same expertise banks used for old-fashioned loans and their funding is still what they do for derivatives  securitizations  and credit scoring. That having been said  however  one must quickly add that the new instruments and procedures raise real questions about both managing and supervising risk by instruments and/or by legal entity. Banking organizations are doing so less and less  and as a result supervisors are following suit. Banking organizations have increasingly centralized risk management at the parent as a necessity because the credit decisions cross legal entities and certainly cross instruments. The new technology has already created a supervisory imperative that financial modernization--with its new permissible activities--can only accelerate: the need to evaluate risk policies and positions centrally-- most likely by one supervisor  sharing information with all legal entity regulators. But  I must say  it is not clear to me precisely what this technology implies for the legal entity regulators. If units of an organization  through combinations of puts and calls  can simulate all the attributes of a security  or even most of the risks and returns of certain businesses  what does the term “functional regulator” mean? Historically  when a legal entity--a unit of an organization--was the only vehicle for participating in a certain function  the idea of separating regulators by functions was consistent with legal form. It is increasingly less so when a synthetic asset can be created with the same risk and return characteristics of the underlying asset. Or  how comfortable should the individual regulator feel if a hedge involves as counterparties two legal entities in the same failing organization? Will the regulator of unit A let the gains booked in his unit offset losses in unit B  regulated by another entity? Can he do so under the law? If the answer to either question is no  what good is such a hedge at a failing organization? Even without complicating the issue by failure  how does the regulator of the unit booking the loss on the hedge feel about the hedge  no matter how desirable the hedge is for the whole organization? The new reality  it seems to me  is that supervisors have to supervise risk and not instruments or entities. And that implies either that we keep organizations in old-fashioned straight- jackets and permit no new activities--a strategy which the market and technology has already undermined--or we recognize that  over time  specialized regulators of banks  of securities firms  of even insurance companies--are going to have to find a new paradigm. We are  I believe  groping toward that future supervisory structure. At its center will be an evaluation of risk management procedures and policies. Historically  bank holding company supervision has dealt with an organization that was overwhelmingly a bank  and until Section 20s  whose affiliates were engaged in businesses that could be conducted within the bank. The supervisory approach was  not surprisingly  to apply bank-like supervision to the affiliates. The designers of financial modernization legislation and the holding company or umbrella supervisor must consider how to change that approach as bank affiliates increasingly are engaged in businesses not permitted to banks  and possibly even subject to regulation by a nonbank regulator. At a minimum  it is desirable to avoid redundant regulation. More basically  the necessarily intrusive supervision of banks that comes with the safety net should not be extended to these new activities. In part  such supervision would reduce efficiency and flexibility. In part  it would be unnecessary. And  in larger part  it could create a moral hazard by fostering the wrong impression that a bank supervisor BIS Review 40/1997 - 5 - has confirmed the strength of the supervised affiliate. Thus  the focus of holding company supervision  as I noted  should be evaluation of risk management policies and procedures for the organization. Safety Net Subsidies and Organizational Form Beyond regulatory structure  financial modernization--the linkage of banks to a wider range of financial activities--also raises organizational structure issues. This issue is closely linked to the subsidy provided by the federal safety net  a much discussed topic in recent weeks. By the safety net I mean deposit insurance  and access to both the Federal Reserve discount window and the Fed’s payment system. While many of the questions associated with this topic are subtle and complex  I believe that some of the more basic issues regarding the safety net subsidy can be understood using straightforward economic reasoning. Unfortunately  much of the debate thus far has tended to be more obscure than it needs to be. Take  for example  the question of whether a subsidy exists. Most observers agree that there is a gross subsidy  and that the real issue is whether there is a subsidy net of regulatory costs. But here the discussion often seems to get confused. To me  it is critical at this point to distinguish clearly between the concepts of total benefits  total costs  and marginal benefits and marginal costs. We all know  at least those of us with some training in economics should know  that profit maximizing firms will equate marginal benefits with marginal costs. Applied to the subsidy debate  this principle implies that in equilibrium a profit maximizing bank should set the marginal benefits of the subsidy equal to its marginal costs. In other words  rational firms should drive the net marginal benefit of the subsidy to zero. Importantly  this implies that  at the margin  it may be very difficult to actually observe the subsidy. I suspect that this goes a long way toward explaining why efforts to estimate the marginal value of the subsidy have  to date  proved less than successful. Even though rational firms equate marginal benefits and marginal costs  they clearly do not equate total benefits and total costs. Indeed  standard microeconomic theory says that in a competitive equilibrium total benefits should exceed total costs. Again applying this concept to the subsidy debate  at any individual  profit maximizing bank the total benefits of the subsidy should exceed the subsidy’s total costs  even though the subsidy’s marginal net benefit is zero. This total net benefit allows the banking industry to be larger  and perhaps riskier  than it would otherwise be. The fact that we do not observe banks voluntarily giving up their charters suggests that it may well be that the safety net’s total benefits exceed its total costs  even if the value of the net marginal subsidy is zero. Consider another point that derives from the distinction between total and marginal benefits. Today  we would expect banks to be maximizing their total net benefits from the subsidy using all of the activities in which they are capable of engaging. Now consider what a rational bank will do if given a new opportunity  say expanded securities powers  to maximize profit. Wouldn’t we expect the bank to once again equate marginal benefits with marginal costs  including the marginal benefits and costs of the safety net subsidy? But in the resultant new equilibrium  where the value of the net marginal subsidy is again zero  would the total net benefits of the subsidy be the same as in the previous  more constrained equilibrium? Clearly the answer is no. We would expect total net benefits to be larger  and the banking industry to be larger  as it rationally sought to fully exploit the new opportunities to make profits and exploit the subsidy. Rather than focus on measuring how large the net subsidy is today  perhaps the more appropriate focus of our discussion should be on the more speculative question of how the expansion of bank powers would enhance the value of the safety net subsidy  and what would be the characteristics of the resulting competitive relationships. Another key idea to keep in mind when thinking about the value of the safety net subsidy is that we would fully expect the value of the subsidy to vary quite significantly across banks BIS Review 40/1997 - 6 - and over time. The safety net subsidy can be thought of as deriving primarily from the confidence that investors have in the belief that banks will be supported in times of financial crisis. This confidence is reflected in lower total and marginal costs of funding for banks  including lower capital requirements than otherwise would be the case. The economic value of this confidence is almost surely rather low at very healthy banks during good economic times. However  the value can be very much greater for any bank in financial distress  and can skyrocket in times of systemic financial crisis. As Chairman Greenspan noted in congressional testimony recently: What was it worth in the late 1980s and early 1990s for a bank with a troubled loan portfolio to have deposit liabilities guaranteed by the FDIC  to be assured that it could turn illiquid to liquid assets at once through the Federal Reserve discount window  and to tell its customers that payment transfers would be settled on a riskless Federal Reserve Bank? For many  it was worth not basis points but percentage points. For some  it meant the difference between survival and failure. Empirical research on the option value of deposit insurance supports the point I am trying to make. Estimates of the option value of deposit insurance  while subject to many caveats  show that riskier banks have considerably higher option values. What does all of this mean for the appropriate organizational form that future banking organizations should take? Now that is  I need not tell this audience  a complicated question! But I think the basic questions that we must answer are clear. First  assuming that one of the goals of public policy is to not expand the safety net subsidy  what organizational form minimizes the chances of such an expansion? Second  assuming that another goal of public policy is to limit the opportunities for banks to exploit the moral hazard incentives inherent to the safety net  what organizational form best ensures the safety and soundness of banks? The holding company organizational structure has a proven track record of helping to achieve both of these public policy goals. Indeed  years before I joined the Board  previous Boards worked hard at convincing market participants that there is a clear distinction  in terms of access to the safety net  between a bank and its affiliates. Market practice supports the view that we have achieved considerable success at making this distinction. To me  it seems not only logical  but highly desirable that we should build on this success as we continue to modernize our banking and financial system. When thinking about this issue  it is instructive to understand that in recent years bank holding companies have in fact tended to move activities from the holding company back into the bank. These activities had originally been put in the holding company to avoid geographic and similar restrictions. As a result of this movement back into the bank  the nonbank assets held by holding companies  excluding the assets of Section 20 securities subsidiaries  have declined by almost 50 percent over the last decade to 5.2 percent of consolidated bank holding company assets. When asked why activities are being moved back into the bank  bankers often say that it is to take advantage of the lower funding costs available at the bank. One final point on this issue. It is certainly true that prudent managements of banking organizations will weigh all the relevant factors  including the value of the safety net  when deciding on the best organizational structure for their firm. However  the key point to remember is that those organizations that stand to gain the most from the safety net in times of crisis--those with the highest net subsidy and the strongest incentives to take excessive risks--are the most likely both to prefer and to take advantage of any organizational structures that allow the greatest net subsidy. These are also the organizations that are most likely to distort competitive relationships and expose taxpayers to considerable risk. Thus  while allowing organizations a choice of organizational structure certainly increases bank management’s flexibility  it is not clear that allowing such choice serves the public interest. BIS Review 40/1997 - 7 - Conclusion In closing  let me return to where I began. Financial modernization is a process that must and will continue. But in the course of embracing and adapting to the future we must take care to retain what is of value in the past  and be careful that critical public policy goals are achieved. The separation of banking and commerce is an area where we should be particularly cautious. Once we have mastered the art and science of supervising full service financial organizations  then perhaps we should consider further combining banking and commerce. Technological change and financial innovation are combining to change profoundly the way financial institutions measure  take  and manage risk. These require that financial supervisors also adapt  and we need to move forward in this endeavor. The development of full service financial organizations only reinforces the imperatives to do so. When designing a system that maintains bank safety and soundness and constrains extension of the safety net  organizational structure is not irrelevant. Here again it seems prudent that we should be cautious  and build on structures that have proven their worth. I am confident that a proper balance can be achieved between our sometimes conflicting and always complex goals. Indeed  I look forward to trying to contribute to the ongoing discussion and resolution of the challenges of financial modernization. Thank you. BIS Review 40/1997

Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa  a Deputy Director General of the Bank of Italy  at the Governors' Dinner held in Basle on 7/4/97.,Mr. Padoa-Schioppa reviews his experience in central banking over the last thirty years Text of the remarks by Dott. Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa  a Deputy Director General of the Bank of Italy  at the Governors' Dinner held in Basle on 7/4/97. 1. To have been invited to attend and address the Governor’s dinner is a very great honour for me as I step down from the chair of the Basle Committee and leave the community of central bankers. When Governor de Larosière proposed my name to succeed Gerry Corrigan  he admitted  so I have been told  that my curriculum vitae was not that of a full-time bank supervisor. Presenting this handicap as an advantage  he suggested that my previous involvement in a variety of central banking activities could be useful because of the growing interaction between monetary policy  payment systems and banking stability. You were generous enough to accept that view. That was an act of confidence. As words like confidence  trust and credibility are the very essence of the vocabulary of banking  I am deeply grateful for the confidence you granted me four years ago. 2. In view of my mixed background  I shall focus on central banking  rather than just banking supervision  and try to sum up what I have learned and what I have witnessed over the last thirty odd years: first about the tasks of central banking and then about the context in which such tasks are performed. 3. A person of my generation is inevitably struck by the difference between what he was taught at university in the sixties and the reality he faced in the two following decades. In the lecture room central banking had just one pole  monetary policy. In the real world I found it was triadic  as monetary policy was combined with involvement in the payment system and banking supervision. At the Bank of Italy  for instance  more than half the staff of just over 9 000 is devoted to the operation of the payment system (the note issue  clearing systems  Treasury inpayments and outpayments  interbank funds transfers  etc.); around 15 per cent is engaged in banking supervision; less than 5 per cent is concerned with monetary policy. Although not all central banks have primary responsibility for banking supervision  the three tasks are inextricably linked because there is a close relationship between them and the three practically indivisible functions of money as numeraire  means of payment and store of value. Dealing with the complexities of triadic central banking has been for me both a fascinating professional experience and an intellectual adventure bringing new insights nearly every day. 4. Not only was monetary policy the sole task highlighted when I was a student  but the word “monetary” was overshadowed by the word “policy”. Monetary policy had always existed  of course  but the rise of fiat money greatly increased the room for manoeuvre. The central banker came to be seen in the fifties and sixties as a demiurg able to choose between inflation and unemployment  and to do so almost on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So delicate and powerful was the policy choice entrusted to the central banker that he could not be left to make it alone. Few central banks were truly independent. The intellectual paradigm that followed the demise of the Gold Standard  with its emphasis on discretionary goal BIS Review 41/1997 - 2 - setting  implicitly suggested that elected politicians should have the last word. Future historians will perhaps see this view of the role of central banks as having characterized only two or three of the twenty or so decades of their modern history  which began when convertible paper superseded coins as the main means of payment. 5. After a long period of neglect  payment systems have gradually returned to the centre of the stage. When advances in data processing and telecommunications brought a new revolution  we suddenly realized how much our monetary institutions  practices and even theory owed to the previous revolution. Until the eighties the term “payment system” was almost completely absent from central bank reports. Today  there are many who argue that monetary policy functions would not have developed in the way they did without the first revolution in payment technology. The raison d’être for central bank involvement in payment systems is to avoid  or at any rate minimize  systemic risk  while fostering their efficiency through an appropriate blend of cooperation and competition in the industry. Is there also a policy  or even a political  dimension? Perhaps not. The issue of central bank independence would be a much less burning one if only payment system tasks were considered. And systemic risk itself could become much less important in the years to come with the shift from net to gross settlement that new technologies are making possible. It is possible that payment system issues will move to the back of the stage again once appropriate arrangements are in place to cope with the new technological environment. 6. Chronologically  if not logically  the task of supervising banks came after that of running the payment system and before the advent of fiat money and discretionary monetary policy. From a monetary angle  it was the consequence of the spread of deposit banking  which ultimately resulted in bank money accounting for the bulk of the money stock. Runs on deposits can be seen as collapses of confidence about the stability of the rate of exchange between a unit of central bank money and a unit of commercial bank money. Commercial banks had to have sound fundamentals if one-to-one convertibility was to be preserved hence  the need for bank supervision. In the short run interventions  i.e. lending of last resort  could be - and was - used to support the rate. But  as in the more familiar case of foreign exchange interventions  they were no substitute for sound policies; credit provided too easily and too generously could even generate the risk it was meant to avoid; today we call it moral hazard. The ambivalent relationship between supervising banks and lending to them (surveillance and conditional lending  in IMF language) explains why there is no clear-cut answer to the question whether the central bank or a separate agency should be responsible for supervision. Seven of the twelve Basle Committee countries have a separate agency  as against about 10 per cent of countries in the world as a whole. More importantly  even where this solution has been adopted  the centrality of the banking system  and of its money creation prerogatives  in the monetary policy transmission mechanism means that no central bank disregards the “state of health” of its banks or completely rules out lending of last resort in extreme circumstances. 7. The other  perhaps more important  change concerns the context of central banking. This can be seen in terms of both time and space. I began my career in a world of annual accounts and quarterly or monthly statistics  in which paper was the medium and mail the carrier. For the bulk of financial transactions the two parties  the intermediary  the currency of denomination  the relevant laws and courts  and the central bank all belonged to the same jurisdiction. And that jurisdiction was not only economic  as it included the political jurisdiction from which public BIS Review 41/1997 - 3 - institutions derive their legitimacy through the democratic process. This simple description never fully coincided with the state of the world  of course  but twenty-five years ago it was still a workable approximation. Today  that is no longer true. The advance of data processing and telecommunications technology has been the most powerful single driving force of this change. But the low cost of transportation  the evolution of economic ideas  the desire for closer and more peaceful relationships among nations have also been crucial. 8. The time dimension of our world has shifted from the long and medium waves of the year and the quarter to the short and micro waves of the day and the intra-day. The direct credit controls many of our countries still used ten or fifteen years ago called for compliance at the end of the month  as did most other prudential requirements. Payment finality at the close of the day  achieved through clearing and settlement in central bank money rather than correspondent banking  was considered sufficient. Monthly figures (not monthly averages of daily data) were judged adequate for the purpose of computing compulsory reserves. The exchange rate and other prices were “fixed” once a day. The reality of the monetary and financial world is becoming that of the intra-day  the micro wave; we are moving towards a continuous-time economy. We do not yet have markets for “one-hour money”  real-time accounting and reporting  and other similar devilries. But they will come. The Basle Committee has stated that “although regular reporting will in principle take place only at intervals (in most countries quarterly)  banks are expected to manage the market risk in their trading book in such a way that the capital requirements are being met on a continuous basis. i.e.  at the close of each business day”. Naturally  cost considerations will set a limit to the process  but the effects will be - and to some extent already are - sufficient to upset many of the operational and regulatory instruments on which central bankers rely. Indeed  market players have so far been much more at their ease in the new microcosm than public authorities. 9. As regards the space dimension  markets have grown bigger than jurisdictions. A single transaction is now likely to involve a multiplicity of “nationalities” in terms of currencies  players  authorities and legal systems. We used to regard the “State” as the universal container providing the grounds and the rules for the game played by profit-driven players. Today  we sometimes have the impression that no one is responsible for maintaining the grounds or making the rules and even that central banks are the balls some round  some oval - being hit or kicked around in a free-for-all of baseball  golf  cricket  soccer  rugby and American football. 10. Even the most independent  best equipped and highly reputed national central banks are hard put to perform their triadic task effectively in the new conditions of time and space. The new context has been created by the market  evolves in response to market forces and basically meets the needs of private interests. It is a creature of the market much more than of public authorities. Partly because of this evolution central banks and governments have become much more respectful of market forces  even humble. They are much more conscious that wealth and welfare are created primarily in and by the market. They know that this is a much more powerful beast than its would-be tamer. The effectiveness of both the instruments on which central bankers rely - banking operations and regulatory provisions - have been eroded by the innovation in market practices and the blurring of national frontiers. BIS Review 41/1997 - 4 - To some extent this is healthy. Market players are not there to serve us  we are here to serve the economy. Yet  this downsizing of our role should not be carried too far. There is still a public interest to be promoted that private actions cannot be counted upon to serve. There are still grounds for being proud to serve the public interest and for claiming that central banks should have the means to achieve their ends. The fact that markets are powerful  global and fast-moving  while central bank operations and regulations are national  intrusive and burdensome  does not mean the monetary system can do without a central bank or a bank regulator. 11. Basle  the BIS  the meetings of the community of central bankers  from the Governors down to junior officials  are where our profession has strived  largely successfully  to maintain the upper hand over the reality that calls for its public function. The task is being performed notwithstanding the wide diversity of national laws  traditions  operational practices and institutional constraints. I am a convinced institutionalist  because I believe that without a “Rule of Law” liberty and peace - the key prerequisites for economic activity - cannot survive for long. And my basic training  as well as much of my professional experience  have been in the European arena  which is a highly institutionalized cooperative system. In international monetary cooperation Basle stands at the “soft” end of the spectrum - no legal basis  no written terms of reference  no extensive minutes. Mostly personal contacts and work based on the key words of banking and central banking: confidence  trust  credibility  confidentiality. 12. Although I started to attend BIS meetings well before this tower was constructed (in the old hotel building of the Centralbahnstrasse)  it was only when you called me to the Basle Committee that I fully realized how strong this soft approach could be. Lawyers say that the Basle Committee “does not legally exist”. When I was appointed to its chair  my secretary had to take my word for it because she could not find any written evidence of the decision. Yet the Committee rules  once endorsed by you  are adopted by the markets  followed by national legislators and spread to all countries worldwide. When considering the working methods of the Basle Committee  I have often thought that international cooperation among central banks can be compared to Italo Calvino’s “Nonexistent Knight”. When Charlemagne  reviewing his paladins before the battle against the Infidels  reached the last knight  Agilulf  clad entirely in white armour  the cavalier refused to show his face to the emperor. The explanation he gave was simple: “Sire  because I do not exist”. Charlemagne insisted and when the knight finally raised his visor  the helmet was empty. “Well  well! Who’d have thought it!” exclaimed Charlemagne. “And how do you do your job  then  if you don’t exist?”. “By will power and faith in our holy cause!” said Agilulf. He fought with valour and bravery. His special status assisted him in the accomplishment of his duty and indeed he proved to be one of the best paladins. BIS Review 41/1997

First a word of thanks for the invitation to speak about EMU. Less than twelve months have passed since the Riksbank last attended a meeting of the Swedish Retail Federation with information about EMU. Perhaps some of you were present on that occasion. Whereas the issue of EMU was still fairly new a year ago and not much discussed by most people  the situation today is different. In the interval we have experienced a marked increase both in what people know about EMU and in their interest in the matter. This naturally has to do with the rapid approach of the starting date. Today the move to Stage Three lies fewer than 500 working days ahead. Moreover  there is no mistaking the strength of the political determination in Europe to start on time. This was evident not least at the recent Ecofin meeting in the Netherlands when the EU finance ministers agreed on several important matters such as the stability and growth pact and ERM2. Today I shall be outlining the process leading up to Stage Three of EMU and the changes that we already know will occur. I will also say something about EMU's consequences for retail trade. Before considering practical aspects of EMU  permit me to begin with a look at some general economic features. Sweden should join from the start The Riksbank is in favour of Sweden participating in the euro area right from the start in 1999. The reasons for this have been spelled out in our submission on the Calmfors report  for example. As regards the economic arguments  we do not believe that  by remaining outside the euro area  Sweden would incur particularly large costs for stabilisation policy; in the event of economic shocks  it is structural changes rather than monetary policy that should be used in the first place to counter rising unemployment  for instance. On the political side  we share the report's assessment that the political costs of not participating would be substantial; as an outsider Sweden would not belong to the inner circle of countries that will be deciding Europe's future. It should also be realised that countries which belong to the euro area from the start will have more influence on how the European Central Bank (ECB) develops in the crucial early years  when the forms for its work are being established. Our possibility of influencing important decisions is also likely to be reduced in other fields beside monetary policy. If Sweden were to refrain from joining the euro area at all  there would be a risk of being marginalised as an outsider. The preparations What progress has been made in the move to EMU? The work of preparing for Stage Three is now in full swing in every EU body and all the member states. A green paper on the practical arrangements for a changeover to a single currency was presented by the Commission in May 1995 and the European Council  meeting in Madrid in December  adopted a changeover scenario which fixed the timetable for the main decisions. It was agreed that Stage Three of EMU is to start on 1st January 1999 and that  in the light of which member states fulfil the convergence criteria on the basis of statistics for 1997  as early as possible in 1998 the Council is to confirm which countries will participate in the European currency area. On 1st January 1999 exchange rates are to be locked and responsibility for monetary policy is to be transferred to the ECB. The euro is to be introduced as an independent currency and all -BIS Review 41/1997 - 2 - monetary policy transactions are to be in euro. For a time the national currencies will continue to circulate alongside the euro but legally they will be one and the same currency. If this seems odd  remember that Sweden's currency  for example  can be expressed in kronor as well as öre. Euro  however  will not be available for our wallets from 1st January 1999; euro banknotes and coins are to come into circulation on 1 January 2002 at the latest. That will initiate a massive exchange of existing national banknotes and coins. By 1st July 2002 at the latest the krona will cease to be legal tender  though of course the Riksbank will continue to exchange kronor for euro. Which countries will be included? The EU countries are now striving to fulfil the economic criteria for participation in the euro area. This is being accompanied by strenuous political efforts to remove any remaining obstacles. Today I can only say that it is not until the spring of 1998 that we will actually know which countries will be establishing the union. The EMI and the Commission will each be publishing a report and the Commission will issue recommendations on which countries should participate. On the basis of these reports and recommendations  the opinions of the European Parliament and the national parliaments are to be heard  which is expected to occur in April. The decision about which countries will participate is to be taken around the turn of April at a weekend meeting of the Ecofin Council and the Heads of State or of Government. It is therefore unnecessary to speculate about this today. As far as Sweden is concerned  it looks as though we will in fact fulfil the convergence criteria. Whether or not we participate will therefore depend on the decision by the Riksdag (Sweden's parliament). What is the Riksbank doing? The Riksbank has to contribute to a situation whereby Sweden is able to participate in practice if a majority in the Riksdag so decides. That is why preparations are already necessary. A basic principle in this work is that it shall be voluntary - the requisite adaptations are a matter for each organisation to decide. All those concerned must of course also solve any problems they encounter as a consequence of EMU. For the Riksbank  a highly important task in Sweden's preparations is information about and consultations with the financial sector on matters to do with the changeover. To this end we have formed a consultative group (SIFS) and five sub-groups to work on the practical preparations together with the financial sector. This collaboration has led us to conclude that the financial sector can cope with a changeover to euro on 1st January 1999. We also consider that in some respects joining later would make the preparations more difficult. The worst alternative would be a long period of uncertainty about our participation  what we usually call a ""soft no"". Costly double systems would then be required in several areas. We have also observed concern in the financial sector that staying outside the euro area would entail increased costs  competitive disadvantages and risk various forms of discrimination. ""Wait-and-see"" may be less attractive A common opinion at present seems to be that a soft no is not unlikely and would not involve appreciably higher economic costs than participation from the start. Deferring participation for some years would not exclude us from the euro area for good. In our cooperation with the financial sector  however  we have seen that uncertainty about participation is causing many financial agents to make preparations for handling euro as well as kronor. The nub of the matter is that euro services will be called for whether or not we join the area. The use of euro will be directed by the market. Naturally the euro would not replace the BIS Review 41/1997 - 3 - krona as Sweden's currency if we remained outside but we could probably expect a demand for euro from some agents. According to the Stockholm Stock Exchange  trading in the shares of major companies will gradually switch to euro because handling two currencies would be too costly. In time the money and bond market may be affected in that renewals and new issues are denominated in euro and account for a growing proportion of bond trading. According to the Securities Dealers Association  for instance  large companies and financial markets will also become less interested in kronor. It is too early to say how this transition from kronor to euro will occur in detail. Neither can we foresee how quickly it will proceed or how far. Probably it will be gradual and ultimately also affect private individuals. If the euro turns out to be stable and strong  households will also prefer to have pension savings  for example  in euro securities. Thus  this scenario points to a development where financial markets  companies and even individuals are active in euro  while the public sector continues to use kronor as declared  for instance  in the report from the Ministry of Finance on practical preparations for the euro. Such a situation would no doubt lead in time to the public authorities also encountering a demand for euro services  perhaps ultimately leading to the euro being accepted to a greater extent than desired at present. If so  the ""wait-and-see"" alternative would finally amount in practice to the adoption of the euro. We can only speculate about the practical consequences of a gradual transition but it would probably entail increased costs as well as greater uncertainty for firms as well as society. If we intend to join the euro area in a not too distant future after 1999  the recommendation therefore seems to be: participate from the start and avoid unnecessary and costly solutions for firms as well society. Still a large need of information When talking about the monetary union we should be clear that in Sweden the debate about Europe and EMU is relatively new. Elsewhere in Europe the issue of integration has been discussed much more and for far longer. The debate in Sweden has been rather low key and not particularly widespread. So it is hardly surprising that people here are hesitant and want more information. That the discussion has now got going is all to the good. I was therefore pleasantly surprised by the submissions to the Ministry of Finance on the EMU report. Of 56 submissions  only 4 were negative about EMU. The proportion in favour of Sweden participating from the start in 1999 was as high as 46 per cent  while 13 per cent wanted to wait and see and 33 per cent did not voice an opinion about participation. Many of the interested parties are for EMU: the Federation of Swedish Industries  the Retail Federation  the Bankers' Association  the Confederation of Professional Associations and the Employers' Confederation  to mention just a few. In general it seems that the discussion of EMU has spread from the financial sector to companies  authorities and large organisations but has not yet reached the man in the street. The time ought now have come for us all to consider the matter. How does EMU affect retail trade? The details of how EMU will affect retailing in Europe are not yet clear. We do not even know which countries will make up the euro area from the start. Still  I shall try to present some general features. EMU is intended to strengthen and deepen European integration and promote the mobility of capital  goods and services. In time  therefore  a single currency is likely to make retailing more efficient and cheaper. Inside the area  prices will be more transparent and there will be no exchange risk. Decreased costs for currency exchange and hedging suggest that in time retailing will benefit from EMU  an opinion I share with the Wholesale & Retail Research Institute. In the short run  however  the union involves retail trade in a great deal of work. Shops will be in the firing line when the euro notes and coins are introduced. Cashiers will have to handle kronor and euro side by side for a time and customers BIS Review 41/1997 - 4 - will no doubt have many questions about prices and conversion rates. Besides calling for resources as well as training  this will require a good deal of adjustment in retail trade. I shall now consider some of the foreseeable changes and also take this opportunity of commenting on the requirements formulated by the Research Institute for a changeover to euro. Banknotes and coins The Madrid meeting in 1995 agreed that euro notes and coins are to be introduced at the latest by 1st January 2002. Many people have reacted to an introduction at the turn of a year  which is when retailing tends to be most hectic. The agreement  however  stipulates 1st January 2002 as the latest date  so perhaps a start might be made in the autumn of 2001. The alternative of spring 2002 has also be mentioned. This matter is still being discussed; the Riksbank shares the trade's opinion that the turn of a year should be avoided and is therefore working for another date. The timing of the practical changeover arrangements is to be decided by each country; for Sweden the Riksbank hopes that it can be managed in a much shorter period than the maximum of six months. The public will be informed in good time about how the changeover is to be carried out. Information about security details and appearance will also be made available. We now know that there will be seven banknotes and eight coins  which is somewhat more than Sweden's denominations at present. One face of the coins will carry a national motif that each country decides. The notes may also display a national symbol. Nickel in the coins? The question of nickel in the coins has also been discussed  for instance among finance ministers and central bank governors. Swedish retailers have demanded that coins denominated in euro and cent are not to contain nickel; the Riksbank and the Ministry of Finance have both worked hard to achieve this but are fighting rather a lone battle. Today it does look as though four to six out of eight coins will be nickel-free  which must be regarded as a major success for the Swedish position. A decision  however  is not due until the summer. Double currencies For a period of up to six months there will be two currencies to handle and retailers have demanded that the period be limited to three months. We can understand their argument in principle. Much will be required of traders. Instead of the present five denominations of notes there will be twelve and instead of four coins there will likewise be twelve. The value of cash holdings in retail trade (cash liquidity) will be greater than usual  with an increased risk of counterfeit notes and robbery  for example. Retailers will also have to consider temporary storage space for cash-boxes and additional transport requirements. The Riksbank is likewise working to make the period with double currencies as short as possible. There are  however  other aspects to consider. Incorporating euro in the system will take time. Just the work of distributing the new banknotes will be time-consuming. We shall be looking into what is feasible in practice. Time will also be needed to adapt the automatic teller systems (Bankomat and Minuten) to the new currency. Another matter to be investigated is whether the distribution of euro to banks  post offices and possibly retailers can start before the date on which the new currency becomes legal tender. Moreover  some consumer interests  for instance  have said than many consumers would prefer a relatively long changeover period in which to get used to the new currency. The question of the period with double currencies therefore calls for further discussion in order to arrive at a solution that everyone can accept. Retailers have also put forward the view that it should be possible to provide change only in euro from day one. We believe this may be difficult both in practice and on the grounds of the accepted BIS Review 41/1997 - 5 - changeover principle of ""no compulsion - no prohibitions"". It has been said that people in general are to be free to decide whether to use euro from the start on 1st January 1999 or to wait until the changeover is completed in 2002. During this period no one is to be compelled to use euro  though this will be encouraged. Kronor and euro will both have the status of legal tender  so we must be prepared to handle them both during this period. But the discussion of this question should continue. Responsibility for information The retail trade report considers that society must be responsible for information about the new currency system. At the same time the Ministry of Interior and others consider that information at points of sale  for example  is primarily a business responsibility. This makes me somewhat uneasy. I believe we must all be prepared to accept an additional responsibility for information about these matters. Otherwise there is a risk of people feeling they are getting insufficient guidance  with an increased risk of the changeover being arduous for everyone. At the Riksbank we will try to do our bit. Brochures about the new means of payments will be distributed  possibly accompanied by ready-reckoners for the conversion rates. Our Payment System Department is working on this. Price information Retailers will be obliged to work for a period with some form of double pricing. The practical arrangements for this are mainly a matter for the retail trade and consumer interests. Rounding In Sweden we have grown used to having the total sum rounded to the nearest 50 öre. Retailers have expressed a wish that this should continue to be possible with the euro  in which case an active introduction of the 1 and 2 cent coins would not be called for and we could round to the nearest 5 cents (approximately 43 öre). We appreciate this view and have promoted it at various levels but without gaining much support. So we do not yet know the outcome. It must be realised  however  that if we join the euro area  even the smallest denominations will be legal tender. So there is no way of entirely avoiding the small coins in Sweden. Cash receipts Today's cash registers are capable of recording total sums in two currencies. If each item is to be registered in both currencies  however  it seems that all the existing cash registers would have to be replaced. I agree intuitively with retailers that it would hardly be reasonable to do this throughout Sweden in order to register two currencies for a period that is likely to be shorter than six months. Perhaps we can make do with receipts that give the total in euro as well as kronor together with the conversion rate. That would be much the same information as the banks have agreed to provide on statements of account. Once again  however  this is a matter where retailers and consumers must get together and discuss what is reasonable. As I have said  EMU will affect each one of us. So let me conclude by mentioning some other changes in fields where retailing is not directly involved. Other changes: Securities BIS Review 41/1997 - 6 - The countries in the euro area may  and should  denominate new sovereign issues in euro. A country wishing to convert its outstanding debt into euro will be allowed to do this  too. We can also pass national laws enabling  for instance  the Stockholm Stock Exchange  OM and the Securities Register Centre (VPC) to switch to euro right from 1999. Many institutions and agents are in favour of this. The above institutions as well as participants in the Swedish securities market  banks  financial institutions and others unanimously recommend a big-bang solution - a quick  concerted changeover from kronor to euro right from the beginning of 1999. With a single monetary policy and no exchange risk  the only factor behind interest rate differentials for sovereign securities will be the credit risk. The market for Swedish government paper will be more or less integrated with the euro market for government securities. Given a reasonably similar debt situation  government bonds issued by different countries can then be handled in a similar way. Banks. During 1996 the banks have worked on strategies and routines for changing over to euro. It has been agreed that during the changeover period banks  the postal giro  the bankgiro and the private giro will handle kronor as well as euro. Cashiers will redenominate payments in the currency used for the institution's system  regardless of which currency the customer has used. Bank branches will provide two versions of their forms  one for kronor and one for euro; new cheques and other forms will therefore be produced. Statements of account will specify the rate at which the currency has been converted. The automatic teller systems (Bankomat and Minuten) will also have to be adapted. Moreover  banks must be prepared for people who want to make giro payments in euro right from the beginning of 1999. Some large companies may also wish to pay out wages in euro before the new currency is available in the form of banknotes and coins. As mentioned earlier  it is difficult to foresee the magnitude of demand for euro services and how soon companies and individuals will switch from kronor to euro. Monetary and exchange rate policy. A single currency implies a single monetary policy  which in EMU will be decided by the ECB. The Riksbank and the other national central banks will have the task of executing this policy. The changes for Swedish banks and other financial institutions will probably not be all that great. The Riksbank is likely to remain the financial sector's counterparty. The main differences from today for Swedish banks are a much larger market for intra-day money and counterparties located all over Europe. The detailed conduct of monetary policy is not yet clear. The final decisions are due when the ECB has been established in 1998. Consequently it is the countries participating from the start that will be able to influence the conduct of policy and the organisation of activities in the new European central bank. Target The conduct of a single monetary policy calls for a single system with which to handle the associated payments. TARGET  the payment system that is now being built up  will link up all the national systems. A payment from  say  Stockholm to Milan will normally be executed in a matter of seconds  whereas at present it often takes a day or more. TARGET's main purpose is to enable the ECB to conduct monetary policy but it also amounts to the establishment of a new expressway for commercial transactions. The extent to which banks and other companies use the system will probably depend on the price. What this will be is not yet clear but costs are to be covered in full. All the national central banks in the EU area will be BIS Review 41/1997 - 7 - entitled to join TARGET  whether or not they are participating in the euro area. There is a significant risk  however  that countries outside the latter area will have more limited possibilities of using TARGET  for instance due to restrictions on intra-day euro credit  which is important for countering fluctuations in payment flows. One of the matters discussed is that outsider banks should close the system at an earlier hour. The Riksbank has acted forcefully to oppose this threat of discrimination. The decisions on this and certain other matters have been deferred  however  and will now be taken by those countries that join the euro area from the start. TARGET is to be tested this summer and is to be fully ready for use by 1st January 1999. Summary and conclusions Most of the evidence today suggests that the economic and monetary union will move to Stage Three on 1st January 1999. For Sweden the question is whether we should join the euro area from the start  wait a while or try to remain outside for good. I hope that we will soon be having a more lively debate on this very important issue. The question of EMU has now been largely examined and discussed by the financial sector  the authorities and big businesses. The time has come to spread the debate and information to other groups in society. In time the krona will lose ground Even if Sweden decides to stay outside  the single currency will affect us. Our analyses  together with other organisations  of what might happen in that event point to a relatively sizeable use of euro  particularly in the securities market. In time  the use of euro may spread like water rings to other parts of society. The extent to which the euro is used will among other things depend on its strength relative to the krona but also on market assessments of the probability of Sweden joining. A good guess seems to be that the shorter the interval before participation  the quicker will be the changeover to euro. The world will not be the same The creation of a monetary union just outside Sweden's borders will change the world as we know it. Individuals and firms will both be affected by the euro's introduction whether we participate or not. In our efforts to keep the financial sector informed about EMU we can see that good progress has been made with the preparations. Among those concerned we also experience a strong desire to participate as early as possible so as not to get left behind. Swedish banks and other companies want to have a chance of competing on equal terms and do not wish to risk losing business opportunities. Finally I therefore wish to underscore that saying no to the single currency is not the same as status quo. As I said  the euro's introduction will affect us all  whether or not we participate. EMU will probably accelerate the globalisation  concentration and integration of the world's financial markets. It is therefore of the utmost importance that we all do what we can to find out more about these complex matters. BIS Review 41/1997"

Roth dresse un tableau de la politique monétaire et de la conjoncture économique en Suisse Allocution de M. Jean-Pierre Roth  Vice-président de la Direction générale de la Banque nationale suisse  au Centre International d’Etudes Monétaires et Bancaires  (CIMB)  à Genève  le 22/4/97. Mesdames et Messieurs  C’est avec des sentiments bien particuliers que je m’adresse à vous aujourd’hui. Certes  le thème de mon exposé - Politique monétaire et reprise: où en sommes-nous ? - est d’une grande actualité alors que notre pays connaît sa septième année de stagnation économique. Mais au-delà de cette constatation - et avant d’entrer dans le vif du sujet -  j’aimerais rendre hommage à la maison qui nous accueille ce soir - l’Institut Universitaire de Hautes Etudes Internationales-  où j’ai eu le privilège de pouvoir faire mes études de doctorat au début des années septante. Par son enseignement dans les domaines de l’histoire  de la politique et de l’économie  l’Institut HEI a formé des générations de diplomates  de hauts fonctionnaires  de chefs d’entreprises  en Suisse et à l’étranger. Sans ne rien ôter aux mérites de HEI dans les autres domaines  je voudrais souligner le rôle éminent que l’Institut a joué et joue encore dans le domaine monétaire. Les plus grands noms de la théorie monétaire sont venus ici  faisant de HEI un centre privilégié d’enseignement sur le plan suisse. Les travaux de recherche de l’Institut ont un renom qui dépasse largement nos frontières. Tout ceci est dû aux efforts du corps professoral et de la direction de HEI  soutenus par les Autorités fédérales et genevoises. Je forme le voeu que ce centre d’excellence dans le domaine de la monnaie et des relations internationales continue à fournir à notre pays les services qu’il nous a rendus jusqu’ici. Je ferme cette parenthèse pour en venir à cette question qui nous préoccupe tous: qu’en est-il de la conjoncture? Sommes-nous au terme de la phase de stagnation qui frappe si durement la Suisse depuis 1990? Pourquoi cette traversée du désert si douloureuse sur le plan social? Quels sont nos moyens pour gérer la situation? J’aborderai le problème en trois phases: en premier lieu  je ferai le point sur la conjoncture internationale et mettrai en évidence la situation particulière dans laquelle se trouve l’Europe continentale dont notre pays dépend si étroitement. Ensuite  je ferai une rétrospective des événements conjoncturels des années nonante et m’attarderai sur les problèmes spécifiques rencontrés par notre pays. Enfin  je tirerai de ce survol quelques enseignements pour la conduite de la politique économique dans ce pays. 1. Un survol conjoncturel Commençons par faire le point de la situation conjoncturelle. Comment ne pas être frappé par la césure qui existe  aujourd’hui  dans les pays de l’OCDE entre le monde anglo-saxon  d’une part  et l’Europe continentale  de l’autre. Les Etats-Unis font preuve d’une bonne santé conjoncturelle  qui semble résister à l’usure du temps. Après avoir stagné  puis reculé à la fin des années quatre-vingt  l’économie américaine a retrouvé le chemin de la croissance. L’emploi global n’a pas cessé d’augmenter et le taux de chômage de baisser. La croissance de l’économie se poursuit sans discontinuer depuis 1992 et aucun ralentissement notable n’est attendu pour l’instant. Le risque d’une pression excessive sur les ressources ne peut même plus être écarté  aussi la Réserve fédérale a-t-elle récemment décidé de relever d’un quart de point le taux des Fonds fédéraux. Les perspectives en matière d’inflation restent toutefois bonnes  avec une progression modeste des coûts salariaux. BIS Review 45/1997 - 2 - Un scénario analogue a pu être observé au Royaume-Uni. Là aussi une stagnation conjoncturelle a pu être observée à la fin des années quatre-vingt. La reprise s’est manifestée un peu plus tard qu’Outre-Atlantique  au début de 1993  soit avec douze mois de retard par rapport au cycle américain. Au Royaume-Uni  comme aux Etats-Unis  la croissance s’est maintenue depuis lors  entraînant une réduction du chômage sans créer de menaces sérieuses pour la stabilité des prix. Force est de constater que l’atmosphère est bien différente sur le continent européen. D’une part  en raison de la réunification allemande  le creux conjoncturel s’y est manifesté plus tard que dans les économies anglo-saxonnes  la croissance tombant à son niveau le plus bas en 1993 seulement  et  d’autre part  la remontée d’activité ne s’est jamais véritablement matérialisée. Après une légère embellie à la fin de 1994 et au début de 1995  le ciel conjoncturel européen s’est à nouveau assombri pour déboucher sur une année 1996 franchement morose contrairement aux attentes. Parallèlement  le chômage a augmenté de manière spectaculaire  atteignant des taux records pour les quinze dernières années. Pour clore ce tour d’horizon  quelques mots sur l’Asie  l’autre pôle de développement de l’économie mondiale. Je ne m’y arrêterai que brièvement car les faits sont largement connus. En Asie  on constate également une opposition entre deux types de situation économique bien différents. Les nouveaux pays industrialisés  qui  dans le sillage des Etats-Unis  ont réalisé d’importants progrès économiques  et ont vu leur croissance  ces dernières années  se situer au-dessus de la moyenne des dix années précédentes. De son côté  le Japon  le champion de la croissance par le passé  a de la peine à retrouver un sentier d’expansion comparable à celui qui était le sien dans les années quatre-vingt. A ses problèmes de compétitivité s’ajoute une situation financière interne chancelante. Qu’en est-il de la Suisse? 2. La situation en Suisse Un survol des dix dernières années nous indique que le destin conjoncturel de la Suisse a été étroitement lié à celui de l’Europe continentale. Comme chez nos voisins immédiats  le cycle conjoncturel s’est retourné en 1993 seulement et  après une amélioration passagère en 1994  de nouveaux signes de faiblesse de la demande sont intervenus en 1995 et 1996. La séquence de nos épisodes conjoncturels a donc parfaitement coïncidé avec ce qui se passait en France et en Allemagne. Mais  contrairement à ces deux pays qui ont pu malgré tout enregistrer des taux de croissance de l’ordre de 1 à 2%  les nôtres sont restés proche de zéro. Dans une Europe continentale croissant à un rythme modeste  la Suisse a connu des années de stagnation. Que s’est-il passé dans notre pays pour qu’il connaisse des élans conjoncturels insignifiants? Ma réponse est relativement simple: la Suisse a connu avec une acuité toute particulière un certain nombre de difficultés rencontrées également par nos voisins. Elle s’est trouvée dans l’inconfortable situation d’être placée continuellement une peu plus que les autres à l’écart des pressions de la demande. leur mouvance mais a occupé Quels sont ces facteurs négatifs? BIS Review 45/1997 2.1. Le renforcement du franc - 3 - Le premier facteur qui a contribué à marginaliser la Suisse sur le plan conjoncturel a été l’évolution du franc. Alors que les monnaies européennes étaient déjà fortes par rapport au dollar  le franc se renforçait à leur égard. L’histoire devra juger si  à la suite de la réunification allemande et dans la perspective de l’Union monétaire  les pays de l’Union européenne n’ont pas été amenés à appliquer une politique monétaire trop restrictive en regard de leur situation économique. Les faits sont là: du début à la fin de 1994  le mark s’apprécie de 10% face au dollar  entraînant le franc français et les autres monnaies du SME dans son sillage. Les raisons de cette correction des changes ne se situent pas que du côté européen. Il faut se souvenir que  durant les années précédentes  les Etats-Unis avaient poursuivi une politique monétaire résolument expansive. Des stratégies monétaires opposées de part et d’autre de l’Atlantique créèrent un potentiel d’ajustement de change. La perte de compétitivité qui s’en est suivi a fait jouer au commerce extérieur européen  en 1995  un rôle de frein alors qu’il aurait dû soutenir la croissance. Les choses ne se sont pas manifestées différemment dans notre pays  mais avec une intensité particulière. Le franc s’est non seulement renforcé face au dollar  mais aussi face aux monnaies européennes. Le coup de frein conjoncturel a donc été encore plus fort chez nous que chez nos voisins. De plus  l’atmosphère conjoncturelle s’effritant en Europe  la Suisse voyait sa demande extérieure perdre rapidement du dynamisme. Les raisons de cette réaction excessive du franc sont vraisemblablement doubles. D’une part  notre monnaie a tendance à “surréagir” en cas de faiblesse du dollar; d’autre part  la discussion sur l’intégration monétaire en Europe a peut-être terni l’image du mark allemand et provoqué le report sur le franc suisse de capitaux spéculatifs. 2.2. L ’héritage de la surchauffe des années quatre-vingt Le second facteur qui a mis en difficulté l’économie suisse dans les années nonante a été la gestion de l’héritage des années quatre-vingt. Nous le savons maintenant  le rythme de croissance de l’économie suisse durant la seconde moitié de années quatre-vingt allait au-delà de ce qui était soutenable en durée. Avant même le krach boursier et les injections de liquidité qui lui furent liées  les crédits augmentaient à un rythme de 8 à 9%. Des signes de surchauffe étaient apparus dans l’immobilier d’abord  dans l’ensemble de l’économie ensuite. Le recours aux ressources productives était excessif. La fin de la période inflationniste des années quatre-vingt entraîna d’importants ajustements structurels  notamment dans l’immobilier. Des situations analogues ont pu être observées en Allemagne et en France  mais le phénomène avait pris chez nous une grande ampleur en raison du rôle du marché hypothécaire. L’assainissement du secteur immobilier  au début des années nonante  a pesé ainsi de manière toute particulière sur la demande globale en Suisse  non seulement sur la demande de construction  mais également sur la demande des ménages  ceux-ci étant souvent confrontés à la nécessité de consacrer une part plus importante que souhaitée de leur revenu disponible au service de leur dette hypothécaire ou de leur loyer. Enfin  après des années de plein-emploi  voire de “suremploi”  la montée du chômage a provoqué beaucoup d’inquiétude et d’insécurité dans le public. Cette situation nouvelle a forcément pesé négativement sur le climat de la consommation. BIS Review 45/1997 2.3. La libéralisation du marché intérieur - 4 - Le troisième facteur qui a influencé la conjoncture helvétique par rapport à celle de ses voisins est la difficile libéralisation de notre marché intérieur. I1 ne fait pas de doute que les années de haute conjoncture avaient conduit à une cartellisation excessive du marché intérieur en Suisse. Les exemples ici sont multiples. Avec l’isolement de notre pays face aux mouvements européens d’intégration  nous avons dû nous atteler nous-mêmes à intérieur. Le processus de déréglementation est engagé. Sur la courte période  ce vent nouveau de concurrence crée des incertitudes  laisse des traces en termes de croissance et d’emploi. Ici aussi  nous nous attaquons à des problèmes que nos voisins connaissent également. Il est probable que la faible dimension de notre marché intérieur  ses cloisonnements culturels et politiques font de cette libéralisation un exercice particulièrement difficile. libéralisation de notre marché la 3. La politique monétaire 1990 -1997 Comment la Banque nationale a-t-elle intégré cette situation économique dans sa stratégie monétaire au cours des dernières années? Comme je l’indiquais tout à l’heure  le début des années nonante a correspondu à la fin d’une phase inflationniste. On l’a oublié aujourd’hui  mais en 1991 notre taux d’inflation avait franchi la barre des 6%. Une certaine accélération de la hausse des prix s’était également manifestée dans les pays qui nous entourent  mais le phénomène avait pris chez nous une ampleur inaccoutumée. Même l’Allemagne  qui vivait alors sa réunification  n’affichait pas des taux d’inflation aussi élevés. La politique monétaire de l’époque visait donc la restauration de la stabilité des prix  en Suisse comme chez nos voisins. Le caractère restrictif de notre politique monétaire du début des années nonante peut être illustré par le fait - et cela était inhabituel - que les taux d’intérêt à court terme dans notre pays se situaient au niveau des taux allemands. La fin de la phase restrictive de la politique de la BNS peut être située au milieu de l’année 1992. L’inflation était encore de l’ordre de 4%  mais nos projections nous indiquaient qu’un ralentissement graduel de la hausse des prix allait intervenir. Par ailleurs  les taux européens  anormalement tirés vers le haut par les conséquences de la réunification allemande  ne nous paraissaient plus correspondre aux perspectives de l’économie suisse. En 1992  la Banque nationale a été la première banque centrale de l’Europe continentale à baisser ses taux d’intérêt. Le différentiel de taux d’intérêt avec l’Allemagne s’est rapidement creusé pour atteindre deux points de pourcentage douze mois plus tard. Cette correction n’a toutefois pas pu corriger les tendances récessives qui existaient déjà chez nous et chez nos voisins européens. Comme je vous l’indiquais tout à l’heure  l’économie suisse entrait en récession au début de 1993 et cette situation dura durant la majeure partie de l’année. La BNS aurait-elle pu assouplir sa politique plus tôt? Cette question a souvent été évoquée dans le public. Les jugements a posteriori sont toujours dangereux car ils se basent forcément sur une connaissance des choses qui n’était pas celle des décideurs de l’époque. Je constate simplement que le franc était orienté à la baisse durant les premiers mois de 1992  et que l’inflation se situait encore entre 4 et 5%  aussi je comprends que la Banque nationale ait BIS Review 45/1997 - 5 - considéré que le moment n’était pas propice à donner des signes de relâchement monétaire. Le risque aurait été d’affaiblir le franc et de relancer une pression inflationniste qui était encore vive à ce moment-là. Une fois la politique monétaire assouplie en Suisse à la moitié de l’année 1992  un relâchement prudent est intervenu en France et en Allemagne  je dis prudent car la décrue des taux dans ces pays s’est toujours située en retrait de ce qui se passait chez nous. Parallèlement  la croissance monétaire reprenait dans notre pays  si bien que des conditions favorables à une reprise apparaissaient progressivement. Pour 1994  une croissance de l’ordre de 1 5% était attendue par l’institut de prévision de l’EPFZ  avec une perspective d’accélération à 2% pour 1995. Le réveil conjoncturel eut bien lieu  non seulement chez nous  mais également chez nos partenaires européens  mais il ne dura pas. De nouvelles difficultés surgirent. En février 1994  la Réserve fédérale américaine décida  après avoir maintenu longtemps une orientation expansive à sa politique  de tirer à nouveau sur les rênes monétaires. En l’espace de douze mois  les taux à court terme sur l’eurodollar passaient ainsi de 3 à 6%  mettant un terme à la baisse des taux en Europe. Les taux longs montèrent sur un large front et le dollar fléchit. Le recul du dollar se poursuivit pendant deux ans  entraînant une appréciation des monnaies européennes  particulièrement du franc suisse qui a toujours tendance à surréagir dans de pareilles circonstances. L’année 1994 joua donc un rôle crucial dans le déroulement des événements conjoncturels de ces dernières années car elle vit une très forte détérioration des conditions monétaires en Europe continentale. La reprise se fragilisa partout sans que les spécialistes s’en rendent compte; leurs prévisions conjoncturelles demeurant franchement optimistes. A la fin de 1994  une accélération de la croissance était encore envisagée pour l’année suivante et une consolidation de ce mouvement en 1996. On le sait  les événements se déroulèrent différemment: le dollar continua de fléchir; la Suisse  comme ses voisins  sombra une nouvelle fois en récession. La Banque nationale provoqua bien de nouvelles réductions des taux d’intérêt et un élargissement de l’écart entre les taux suisses et allemands  mais la croissance économique dans notre pays se ralentit  puis stagna purement et simplement. Au milieu de l’année dernière  il nous est apparu évident qu’un retournement de situation conjoncturel était improbable et que les risques déflationnistes augmentaient. C’est pour cette raison que nous avons donné un accent nouveau à notre politique monétaire  provoquant une baisse des taux d’intérêt sur le marché monétaire. Parallèlement  le dollar  qui avait commencé à se redresser en début d’année  faisait un bond en avant sur le marché des changes et le franc fléchissait par rapport aux monnaies européennes. Dans leur ensemble  la baisse des taux d’intérêt en Suisse et la baisse du franc ont corrigé les conditions monétaires pour les rendre plus favorables à la reprise conjoncturelle. Mais une nouvelle fois nous ne sommes pas seuls. Une amélioration semblable du cadre monétaire est aussi intervenue chez nos voisins allemands et français. Au niveau du continent européen  les conditions monétaires ont rarement été aussi bonnes pour assurer une reprise économique. BIS Review 45/1997 4. Le bout du tunnel? - 6 - Si tel est le cas  peut-on maintenant être optimiste? Sommes-nous au bout du tunnel puisque chez nos partenaires comme chez nous les ingrédients sont là pour permettre un redressement conjoncturel? Je ne doute pas que  la machine économique européenne repartie  nous voyions les choses rapidement bouger chez nous. Nos entreprises ont fait ces dernières années des efforts considérables d’ajustement afin de devenir plus compétitives  d’assurer la qualité de leur produit et de mieux répondre aux besoins de leurs clients. Les mesures de restructuration qui ont été prises - avec leur impact douloureux sur le chômage - révèlent leur prise de conscience et leur volonté d’aller de l’avant. Par ailleurs  il existe suffisamment de ressources disponibles pour qu’une réaction rapide de la production soit possible  et ceci sans pressions inflationnistes . Je m’associe toutefois à ceux qui ne pensent pas que la reprise se manifestera en 1997 avec vigueur. En effet  tout porte à croire que si l’environnement européen sera porteur  ses impulsions demeureront modestes. Pourquoi? termes (a) En premier lieu  les problèmes de l’Europe continentale - comme lieu de production - ne sont pas encore réglés. Les libéralisation  déréglementation  flexibilisation sont souvent évoqués  mais les ajustements sont loin d’avoir été pleinement opérés. Un marché du travail plus efficace  des conditions plus stimulantes pour le développement technologique et la création d’emplois sont les axes de développement sur lesquels tous les Européens doivent s’engager plus fermement. I1 est frappant de constater que depuis le début des années nonante  l’Europe occidentale a détruit environ 4% de ses places de travail alors que les Etats-Unis en ont gagné 8%. Les conditions monétaires seules n’expliquent pas le déclin de la compétitivité européenne. En arrière-plan se trouvent des facteurs plus lourds de formation  de recherche  d’incitation à la création de valeur plutôt qu’à la gestion de l’acquis. Ces problèmes sont difficiles à aborder car ils sont de nature politique  économique et sociale. Le débat sur ces sujets est largement engagé chez nous  il l’est aussi chez nos voisins. Mais nos démocraties européennes ne progressent qu’avec peine dans ces terrains difficiles. (b) En second lieu  la probabilité est grande que nous observions  ces prochains mois  un redressement des taux d’intérêt aux Etats-Unis. L’exemple de 1994 revient alors à l’esprit. Si l’Europe est entraînée dans un mouvement de hausse des taux alors que sa conjoncture est encore fragile  le redressement pourrait être compromis ou  du moins  se déployer à un rythme ralenti. Au coeur du problème se situera bien entendu la position du dollar. Si celui-ci reste orienté à la hausse  les conditions de la reprise resteront favorables. Si un nouvel accident devait intervenir  une hypothèque supplémentaire - bien lourde celle-là - pèserait sur le cycle européen  donc sur notre pays. (c) Enfin  il faut craindre que les incertitudes qui entourent le projet d’unification monétaire pèsent encore sur les décisions des entrepreneurs  voire créent un biais restrictif dans le cours de la politique monétaire européenne  avant tout allemande et française. Peut-on imaginer - avec des marchés continuellement à l’affût de ce qui pourrait être un signe BIS Review 45/1997 - 7 - avant-coureur de la qualité future de l’euro - que les autorités monétaires européennes prennent le moindre risque en matière d’expansion monétaire? Je ne le pense pas. Il faut toutefois souligner un point positif: l’incertitude européenne semble profiter avant tout au dollar américain. Il se peut donc que la situation de dollar fort que nous connaissons maintenant se maintienne au cours des prochains mois  ce qui me fait également penser que le franc suisse ne sera pas forcément au coeur de la tourmente si le processus d’intégration monétaire européenne devait connaître des difficultés. 5. Les enseignements Quels enseignements devons-nous tirer de ce survol de la politique monétaire des dernières années? 5.1. La Suisse: un pays d’Europe continentale Le premier enseignement est une évidence  la situation conjoncturelle de la Suisse dépend étroitement de ce qui se passe à l’étranger  notamment dans les pays qui nous entourent. C’est là que se trouvent nos premiers marchés d’exportation. Depuis le début des années nonante  tous nos retournements conjoncturels ont coïncidé avec ceux de nos grands voisins. C’est une illusion de penser que nous disposons des moyens de nous dégager de cet environnement pour vivre à notre propre rythme économique. Je crois que ceux qui y songent surestiment notre marge de manoeuvre et aussi notre capacité de mettre correctement en cours nos instruments de politique macro-économique. La réalité me semble tout autre: La Suisse est une économie dont la structure  les ressources  les orientations sont proches des autres économies du continent. Nous avons bien entendu nos spécificités  mais plus de points nous lient que nous séparent de nos voisins. Je tire tout naturellement une conclusion intermédiaire de cette constatation: notre ambition dans le domaine macro-économique ne doit pas être de vouloir donner à la Suisse un autre destin conjoncturel que celui de l’Europe  mais d’essayer de la placer au mieux dans le sillage du grand navire qu’est l’économie d’Europe continentale. 5.2. La nécessaire autonomie monétaire Le deuxième enseignement se réfère à la politique monétaire: Pour tenter de tirer le meilleur parti de notre situation dans la mouvance de l’économie de nos voisins  nous devons chercher à jouer le plus souvent possible la carte de notre autonomie monétaire. Cette conclusion  un peu surprenante étant donné notre intégration économique  vient du fait que  aux yeux des marchés  le franc suisse n’est pas perçu comme une monnaie européenne typique. Les réactions du franc aux variations du dollar sont plus exacerbées que celles du DM ou du franc français. I1 en résulte une volatilité qui peut entraver l’activité économique  peser sur la conjoncture. A première vue  on pourrait penser que si tel est le cas  ce n’est pas l’autonomie monétaire  mais bien plus l’alignement qui serait la réponse stratégique appropriée. Je ne le pense pas. Tant que la Suisse ne fera pas partie des institutions européennes  le franc suisse BIS Review 45/1997 - 8 - continuera d’être considéré comme un élément particulier sur le marché. Dans ce cas  l’alignement de notre politique monétaire sur celle de l’Europe - aujourd’hui celle de la Bundesbank  demain celle de la Banque centrale européenne - nous priverait de nos possibilités de réactions en cas de perturbations des marchés. L’autonomie monétaire me paraît donc être la bonne stratégie tant que l’intégration économique et politique de la Suisse en Europe n’est pas définitive. 5.3. Apprécier les conditions monétaires élargies Le troisième enseignement se rapporte à la stratégie monétaire. Dans un pays placé aussi fortement sous l’influence des humeurs des marchés des changes que le nôtre  la politique monétaire ne peut être rigide mais doit essayer de tenir compte. au mieux  des différents types de chocs auxquels il est soumis. Un certain dogmatisme est évidemment nécessaire. Pour les banquiers centraux  le lien entre l’évolution tendancielle de la liquidité et le niveau général des prix est une relation fondamentale qu’ils ne peuvent pas perdre de vue sur la durée. Mais dans la conduite des opérations de court terme  ce que l’on appelle les “conditions monétaires”  c’est-à-dire un juste équilibre entre les conditions de taux d’intérêt et de cours de change  se révèlent être un guide opérationnel utile. Dans notre cas  c’est bien dans le but d’améliorer ces “conditions monétaires” que nous avons relâché notre politique au milieu de l’année dernière. Je ne vous cacherai pas que ce relâchement est allé au-delà de ce que nous attendions car nous avons bénéficié également d’une phase de redressement du dollar. Si la tendance du dollar avait été différente  notre action n’aurait certainement pas produit des effets comparables. 5.4. Disposer de structures efficaces Le dernier enseignement que je tire des événements conjoncturels de ces dernières années est que  dans l’incertitude financière et monétaire qui caractérise l’Europe d’aujourd’hui et qui continuera de la caractériser dans les années à venir  nous devons absolument jouer à bon escient les cartes “structurelles” que nous avons dans notre jeu. L’environnement international est trop contraignant pour que nous puissions nous permettre de ne pas créer sur le plan interne un cadre conduisant à une gestion efficace de nos ressources. Je sors ici évidemment de la politique monétaire pour rappeler l’importance essentielle de nos efforts en matière de formation  de recherche  d’intégration de l’innovation dans les processus de production  mais aussi de flexibilisation des conditions-cadre au niveau du marché du travail et de la création d’entreprises. 6. Conclusion Politique monétaire et reprise: où en sommes-nous? Au cours des derniers mois  d’importants points positifs sont apparus  qui font espérer un réchauffement prochain de l’activité économique. La baisse des taux d’intérêt  la correction du franc et des monnaies d’Europe continentale face au dollar ont créé des conditions-cadre propices au développement de l’activité économique. Par ailleurs  le fait que la politique monétaire soit expansive depuis près de deux ans  que des efforts considérables aient été consentis en matière de restructuration d’entreprise  nous incite à un certain optimisme. BIS Review 45/1997 - 9 - Mais  j’ai essayé de vous le montrer  notre destin économique dépend étroitement de celui de nos voisins européens. Ces pays  comme le nôtre  sortent d’une période de croissance insuffisante  marquée par une augmentation du chômage et par une morosité ambiante. Chez eux aussi  l’atmosphère est plus à la délocalisation qu’à l’investissement. Nous connaissons des problèmes conjoncturels et structurels analogues aux leurs. Ce qui nous sépare de nos voisins  c’est notre relative ouverture vers le monde  la densité de notre production dans des secteurs de pointe  mais aussi notre absence du processus européen d’intégration économique et monétaire. Dans de nombreux cas  nous devons relever  de nos propres forces  les défis qu’ils affrontent ensemble. C’est peut-être une chance  mais les objectifs à atteindre sont très ambitieux; ils réclament toutes nos énergies. Sans aucun doute - nous le sentons déjà maintenant -  la conjoncture se réchauffera et s’améliorera ces prochains mois. Il faut s’en réjouir  mais ne pas crier victoire. Ne nous laissons pas bercer d’illusion. La Suisse ne retrouvera un sentier de croissance durable et pourra résorber son chômage que si elle est capable de préserver ses avantages et même augmenter ses attraits. Cela lui demandera non seulement de bonnes conditions monétaires - sur la durée  la stabilité des prix -  mais également des ajustements en profondeur de ses structures et  au-delà  peut-être une nouvelle manière de gérer ses affaires.

I am quite pleased and gratified to receive the Adam Smith Award this evening. Having been a bank regulator for ten years  I need something to remind me that the world operates just fine with a minimum of us. Fortunately  I have never lost sight of the fact that government regulation can undermine the effectiveness of private market regulation and can itself be ineffective in protecting the public interest. It is most important to recognize that no market is ever truly unregulated in that the self- interest of participants generates private market regulation. Counterparties thoroughly scrutinize each other  often requiring collateral and special legal protections; self-regulated clearing houses and exchanges set margins and capital requirements to protect the interests of the members. Thus  the real question is not whether a market should be regulated. Rather  it is whether government intervention strengthens or weakens private regulation  and at what cost. At worst  the introduction of government rules may actually weaken the effectiveness of regulation if government regulation is itself ineffective or  more importantly  undermines incentives for private market regulation. Regulation by government unavoidably involves some element of perverse incentives. If private market participants believe that government is protecting their interests  their own efforts to do so will diminish. No doubt the potential effectiveness of private market regulation and the potential ineffectiveness of government intervention is well understood by those attending this conference on zero-based government. However  I am sure that you will not be taken aback to hear that many here in Washington are skeptical of market self-regulation and seem inclined to believe that more government regulation  especially in the case of banking  necessarily means better regulation. To a significant degree  attitudes toward banking regulation have been shaped by a perception of the history of American banking as plagued by repeated market failures that ended only with the enactment of comprehensive federal regulation. The historical record  however  is currently undergoing a healthy reevaluation. In my remarks this evening I shall touch on the evolution of the American banking system  focusing especially on the pre-Civil War period  when government regulation was less comprehensive and less intrusive and interfered less with the operation of market forces. A recent growing body of research supports the view that during that period market forces were fairly effective in assuring that individual banks constrained risktaking to prudent endeavors. Nonetheless  the then nascent system as a whole proved quite vulnerable to various macroeconomic shocks essentially unrelated to the degree of banking regulation. I shall conclude by drawing some implications for how banking regulation needs to evolve in the future  with greater reliance on private market regulation. The Roots of Banking Many of the benefits banks provide modern societies derive from their willingness to take risks and from their use of a relatively high degree of financial leverage. Through leverage  in the form principally of taking deposits  banks perform a critical role in the financial intermediation process; they provide savers with additional investment choices and borrowers with a greater range of sources of credit  thereby facilitating a more efficient allocation of resources and contributing importantly to greater economic growth. Indeed  it has been the evident value of intermediation and leverage that has shaped the development of our financial systems from the earliest times--certainly since Renaissance goldsmiths discovered that lending out deposited gold was feasible and profitable. When Adam Smith formulated his views on banking  in the Wealth of Nations  he had in view the Scottish banking system of the 1760s and 1770s. That system was a highly competitive one in which entry into the banking business was entirely free. Competitors included a large number of private  that is  unincorporated  bankers who discounted commercial paper and issued bank notes. Those private bankers sought no government assistance. BIS Review 44/1997 - 2 - Chartered Banking (1781-1838) From the very beginning the American banking system has had an entirely different character. Although some private individuals undoubtedly circulated limited volumes of bank notes  those seeking to circulate a significant volume of notes invariably applied for a corporate charter from state or federal authorities. Entry into the banking business was far from free. Indeed  by the early 1800s chartering decisions by state authorities became heavily influenced by political considerations. Aside from restrictions on entry  for much of the antebellum period state regulation largely took the form of restrictions inserted into bank charters  which were individually negotiated and typically had a life of ten or even twenty years. The regulations were modest and appear to have been intended primarily to ensure that banks had adequate specie reserves to meet their debt obligations  especially obligations on their circulating notes. Nonetheless  the very early history of American banking was an impressive success story. Not a single bank failed until massive fraud brought down the Farmers Exchange Bank in Rhode Island in 1809. Thereafter  a series of severe macroeconomic shocks--the War of 1812  the depression of 1819-20  and the panic of 1837--produced waves of failures. What should be emphasized  however  is the stability of banking in the absence of severe macroeconomic shocks  a stability that reflected the discipline of the marketplace. A bank’s ability to circulate its notes was dependent on the public’s confidence in its ability to redeem its notes on demand. Then  far more than now  there was competition for reputation. The market put a high value on integrity and punished fly-by-night operators. When confidence was lacking in a bank  its notes tended to exchange at a discount to specie and to the rates of other  more creditworthy banks. This phenomenon was evident as early as the late 1790s in Boston  where large amounts of notes issued by New England country banks circulated. In 1799 the Boston banks agreed to accept notes of certain country banks only at discounts of one-half percent. Several years later they began systematically sending back country notes for redemption  and they eventually refused for a time to accept such notes  even at a discount. Early in the 1800s private money brokers seem to have made their first appearance. These brokers  our early arbitrageurs  purchased bank notes at a discount and transported them to the issuing bank  where they demanded par redemption. Difficulties in redeeming the notes of New England country banks eventually produced the first notable example of cooperative self-regulation in American banking  known as the Suffolk Bank System. The Suffolk Bank was chartered in 1818 and entered the business of collecting country bank notes in 1819. In effect  the Suffolk Bank created the first regional clearing system. By doing so  it effectively constrained the supply of notes by individual banks to prudential levels and thereby allowed the notes of all of its associated banks to circulate consistently at face value. In the 1830s  there was a large expansion of state-chartered banks  many of which were severely tested and found wanting during the panic of 1837. However  very few banks failed in New England  where the Suffolk Bank continued to provide an effective  and entirely private  creditor discipline. Free Banking (1837-1863) The intense political controversy over the charter renewal of the Second Bank of the United States and the wave of bank failures following the panic led many states to fundamentally reconsider their approach to banking regulation. In particular  in 1838 New York introduced a new approach  known as free banking  which in the following two decades was emulated by many other states. The nature of free banking and the states’ experience with this approach to regulation have been the subject of profound misconceptions. Specifically  many seem to believe that free banking was banking free from government regulation and that the result was a series of debacles. They conclude that BIS Review 44/1997 - 3 - the experience with free banking demonstrates that market forces cannot effectively constrain bank risktaking. In fact  the “free” in free banking meant free entry under the terms of a general law of incorporation rather than through a specific legislative act. The public  especially in New York  had become painfully aware that the restrictions on entry in the chartered system were producing a number of adverse effects. For one thing  in the absence of competition  access to bank credit was perceived to have become politicized--banks’ boards of directors seemed to regard those who shared their political convictions as the most creditworthy borrowers. In addition  because a bank charter promised monopoly profits  bank promoters were willing to pay handsomely for the privilege and legislators apparently eagerly accepted payment  often in the form of allocations of bank stock at below-market prices. If free banking was not actually as free as commonly perceived  it also was not nearly as unstable. The perception of the free banking era as an era of “wildcat"" banking marked by financial instability and  in particular  by widespread significant losses to noteholders also turns out to be wide of the mark. Recent scholarship has demonstrated that free bank failures were not as common and resulting losses to noteholders were not as severe as earlier historians had claimed. In addition  failure rates and loss rates differed significantly across states  suggesting that whatever instability was experienced was not inherent in free banking per se. In particular  widely cited losses to holders of notes issued by free banks in Indiana  Illinois  and Wisconsin appear to have resulted from banks in these states being forced to hold portfolios of risky state bonds that were not well-diversified  were not especially liquid  and too often defaulted. It was  in short  state regulation that caused the high failure rates. During the free banking era private market regulation also matured in several respects. Particularly after the panic of 1837  the public was acutely aware of the possibility that banks would prove unable to redeem their notes. Discounting of bank notes was widespread. Indeed  between 1838 and the Civil War quite a few note brokers began to publish monthly or biweekly periodicals called bank note reporters that listed prevailing discounts on thousands of individual banks. Research based on data from these publications has shown that the notes of new entrants into banking tended to trade at significant discounts. If a bank demonstrated its ability to redeem its notes  over time the discount diminished. The declining discount on a bank’s notes implies a lower cost of funds  the present value of which can be considered an intangible asset  the bank’s reputation. Banks had a strong incentive to avoid overissuing notes so as not to impair the value of this intangible asset. Throughout the free banking era the effectiveness of this competition for reputation imparted an increased type of market discipline  perhaps because technological change--the telegraph and the railroad--made monitoring of banks more effective and reduced the time required to send a note home for redemption. Between 1838 and 1860 the discounts on notes of new entrants diminished and discounts came to correspond more closely to objective measures of the riskiness of individual banks. Another element of the maturation of private market regulation in banking was the emergence of full-fledged bank clearing houses  beginning with the establishment of the New York Clearing House in 1853. The primary impetus for the development of clearing houses was the increasing importance of checkable deposits as a means of payment. Large merchants were making payments by checks drawn on their deposit accounts as early as the 1780s. But in the 1840s and 1850s the use of checks spread rapidly to shopkeepers  mechanics and professional men. The clearing house reduced the costs of clearing and settling the interbank obligations arising from the collection of checks and banknotes  and thereby made feasible the daily settlement in specie of each bank’s multilateral net claim on  or obligation to  the other banks in the clearing house. By itself  such an efficient clearing mechanism constrained the ability of individual banks to expand their lending imprudently. From the very beginning  however  clearing houses introduced other important elements of private  self- regulation. For example  the New York Clearing House’s 1854 constitution established capital requirements for admission to the clearing house and required members to submit to periodic exams of the clearing house. If an exam revealed that the bank’s capital had become impaired  it could be expelled from the clearing house. BIS Review 44/1997 National Banking (1863-1913) - 4 - One compelling piece of evidence that contemporary observers did not regard free banking as a failure is that the National Banking System  established by an act of Congress in 1863  incorporated key elements of free banking. These included free entry and collateralized bank notes. However  unlike the state laws  the federal law interfered with private market forces by imposing an aggregate limit on note issues  along with a set of geographic allocations of the limit that produced a serious maldistribution of notes. Although the aggregate limit on note issues was repealed in 1875  the collateral requirement for note issues continued to unduly restrict the longer-term growth of the money supply  eventually producing a significant price deflation and  in the 1890s  very poor economic growth. In addition  the restrictions on note issues precluded the accommodation of temporary increases in demands for currency. The inelasticity of the note issue produced strains in financial markets each spring and fall as crops were planted and then brought to market. More seriously  when depositors periodically became nervous about the health of the banks  the demands to convert deposits into well-secured bank notes simply could not be met in the aggregate  and attempts to do so resulted in withdrawals of reserves from the money centers that severely and repeatedly disrupted the money markets. Private markets innovated in ways that tempered the adverse consequences resulting from these flaws in the government regulatory framework. Most notably  the New York Clearing House effectively pooled its members’ reserves by issuing clearing house loan certificates and paying them out as substitutes for reserves in interbank settlements  first in the panic of 1857 and in every subsequent panic. By 1873  clearing houses in many other cities were following the same policy. In addition  the clearing houses accepted as settlement media other currency substitutes issued by their members including certified checks and cashier’s checks. In effect  the clearing houses were assuming some of the functions of central banks. But a true central bank was perceived through most of the 19th century as an infringement of states’ rights. A central bank  in any event  was deemed by many as superfluous given the fully functioning gold standard of the day. It was only with the emergence of periodic credit crises late in the century and especially in 1907  that a central bank gained support. These crises were seen in part as a consequence of the inelastic currency engendered by the National Bank Act. Even with the advent of the Federal Reserve in 1913  monetary policy through the 1920s was largely governed by gold standard rules. Fiscal policy was also restrained. For most of the period prior to the early 1930s  obligations of the U.S. Treasury were payable in gold or silver. This meant the whole outstanding debt of our government was subject to redemption in a medium  the quantity of which could not be altered at the will of the government as it can with today’s fiat currency. Hence  debt issuance and budget deficits were constrained by the potential market response to an economy inflated with excess credit  which would have drained the Treasury’s gold stock. Indeed  the United States skirted on the edges of bankruptcy in 1895 when our government gold stock shrank ominously and was bailed out by a last minute gold loan  underwritten by a Wall Street syndicate. In the broadest sense  the existence of a gold standard delimited the capability of the banking system to expand imprudently. Creation of the Federal Safety Net When the efforts of the Federal Reserve failed to prevent the bank collapses of the 1930s  the Banking Act of 1933 created federal deposit insurance. The subsequent evidence appears persuasive that the combination of a lender of last resort (the Federal Reserve) and federal deposit insurance has contributed significantly to financial stability and has accordingly achieved wide support within the Congress. Inevitably  however  such significant government intervention has not been an unmixed blessing. The federal safety net for banks clearly has diminished the effectiveness of private market regulation and created perverse incentives in the banking system. BIS Review 44/1997 - 5 - To cite the most obvious and painful example  without federal deposit insurance  private markets presumably would never have permitted thrift institutions to purchase the portfolios that brought down the industry insurance fund and left future generations of taxpayers responsible for huge losses. To be sure  government regulators and politicians have learned from this experience and taken significant steps to diminish the likelihood of a recurrence. Nonetheless  the safety net undoubtedly still affects decisions by creditors of depository institutions in ways that weaken the effectiveness of private market regulation and leave us all vulnerable to any future failures of government regulation. As the history of American banking demonstrates  private market regulation can be quite effective  provided that government does not get in its way. Indeed  rapidly changing technology is rendering obsolescent much of the old bank examination regime. Bank regulators are perforce being pressed to depend increasingly on ever more complex and sophisticated private market regulation. This is certainly the case for the rapidly expanding bank derivatives markets  and increasingly so for the more traditional loan products. The lessons of early American banking should encourage us in this endeavor. In closing  I should like to emphasize that the rapidly changing technology that is rendering much government bank regulation irrelevant also bids fair to undercut regulatory efforts in a much wider segment of our economy. The reason is that such regulation is inherently conservative. It endeavors to maintain the status quo and the special interests who benefit therefrom. New ideas  new products  new ways of doing things  all  of necessity  raise the riskiness of any organization  riskiness for which regulators have a profound aversion. Yet since the value of all wealth reflects its future productive capabilities  all wealth creation rests on uncertain forecasts  which means every investment is risky. Or put another way  you cannot have wealth creation without risktaking. With technological change clearly accelerating  existing regulatory structures are being bypassed  freeing market forces to enhance wealth creation and economic growth. In finance  regulatory restraints against interstate banking and combinations of investment and commercial banking are being swept away under the pressures of technological change. Much the same is true in transportation and communications. As we move into a new century  the market-stabilizing private regulatory forces should gradually displace many cumbersome  increasingly ineffective government structures. This is a likely outcome since governments  by their nature  cannot adjust sufficiently quickly to a changing environment  which too often veers in unforeseen directions. The current adult generations are having difficulty adjusting to the acceleration of the uncertainties of today’s silicon driven environment. Fortunately  our children appear to thrive on it. The future accordingly looks bright. BIS Review 44/1997"

Rivlin  at the Annual Meeting of the Eastern Economic Association in Washington  D.C. on 4/4/97.,Ms. Rivlin discusses how economists might be helpful in the current and upcoming macroeconomic policy process Remarks by the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  Ms. Alice M. Rivlin  at the Annual Meeting of the Eastern Economic Association in Washington  D.C. on 4/4/97. I am delighted to be here today with such a large group of my fellow economists. Economists are a very diverse group  but they share a basic kit of analytical tools that shape the way they approach problems. Economists share a useful shorthand vocabulary -- sometimes disparaged by others as jargon -- that makes it easier to communicate with each other. They share a sense of what kinds of things are known about how economies work and  far more important  an appreciation for how much is not known about the workings of any complex human system  including the economy in which we are all living and working right now. Most importantly  economists share a sense of excitement that others often find hard to fathom  about unraveling the many puzzles that abound in economic analysis. At the moment  as a relatively new governor of the Federal Reserve  I am particularly glad to be in a group of economists  because I can be quite sure they don’t share the popular stereotype of a Fed governor. This stereotype has several elements: Any Fed governor or central banker is an inflation freak who thinks reducing inflation should be the only objective of monetary policy and a zero inflation economy would be heaven. Any central banker has a firm view of exactly what growth rate the economy ought not to exceed and how high the unemployment rate ought to be to avoid inflation -- that something called the NAIRU is engraved on a stone tablet somewhere high on a mountain top and all we have to do is find it. Moreover  this stereotypical central banker knows exactly what monetary policy ought to be in order to keep the economy on the desired track. This stereotype leads otherwise quite intelligent members of the press to believe that if central bankers don’t reveal this secret blueprint  it’s because they are being deliberately obscure and inscrutable. The media’s sacred calling is to interpret what central bankers really meant but out of sheer perversity did not choose to say. So it’s a pleasure to be in a room full of economists who know that: while the Fed has access to all the latest statistics and an excellent staff to analyze them  it has not found the stone tablet; those of us at the Fed are working our way through the same fascinating puzzles that confront all economists and make the profession such a lively place to be. I would like to discuss today the primary puzzles that confront those of us in the monetary policymaking arena and then offer a few thoughts about how economists might focus their energies to be helpful in the current and upcoming macroeconomic policy process. I’m afraid I don’t fit the Fed Governor stereotype well at all. I’m not an inflation freak; I’m a growth freak. My answer to the question  “How fast should the economy grow?” is “As fast as it sustainably can.” We don’t benefit from rapid growth spurts that unleash inflation which later has to be reigned in at a high price  just as we don’t benefit from growth that damages the environment and creates a need for costly repair. But we ought to try to be on the highest growth track that is sustainable and stay on it with as few ups and downs as possible  because the downs are so costly  especially in terms of lost opportunity to build human capital. Only trouble is we don’t know exactly what that track is and we’re sure it’s not immutable. BIS Review 44/1997 - 2 - By the same token  we ought to aim to keep unemployment as low as is sustainable. The benefits of tight labor markets are enormous  especially in a society whose future depends on continuous and persistent upgrading of the skills of the whole labor force. If we can keep labor markets at least as tight as they are now for a few years (which  judging from past history  would take an extraordinary combination of skillful policy and good luck)  we can do a lot for the future standard of living of Americans. The benefit would accrue not just to those who are employed and are acquiring job skills and experience that they would not have gotten if they were unemployed. The benefit of tight labor markets is also in the signals they send to individuals and businesses that people should be employed as productively as possible  and that investment in training pays off. These are the economic conditions we need in general  but especially if we are to make welfare reform a success and establish new patterns of school and work for many young people who now see little hope for the future. Welfare reform is going to be difficult to accomplish. The best hope for success is avoiding recession for a long time. The benefits of the recent rapid job growth in the U.S. are especially evident by contrast with Europe. French and German unemployment rates have been incredibly high for a long time. French and German officials speak of their unemployment as “structural” and discuss the need to increase job training  improve the functioning of labor markets  and reduce the incentives not to work which are built into their generous benefit systems. These are all doubtless constructive things to do  but are unlikely to be very successful unless the economies are growing and jobs are being created. It is a lot easier to reduce structural unemployment when the demand for labor is brisk than when it is lagging. So this central banker believes that the goal of monetary policy  like the goal of fiscal policy  ought to be the highest sustainable growth rate and the lowest sustainable unemployment. Low inflation should not be thought of as an end in itself  but as a means to an end. Accelerating inflation has proved a threat to the sustainability of growth  and the self-perpetuating nature of inflation makes it more costly to correct than to avoid. The drafters of the Humphrey Hawkins Act gave the Fed multiple goals. They said: “The Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy’s long run potential to increase production  so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment  stable prices  and moderate long-term interest rates.” That’s a bit ambiguous  but it’s about as good a set of instructions as any. It would be a mistake to reword the Act  as some have suggested  to give the Fed a single objective -- reducing inflation -- on which to focus monetary policy. It would be especially unfortunate to specify a zero inflation target. First  because we don’t measure inflation well enough to know when we have hit an exact target. Second  because the benefits of getting all the way to zero may not be great and the costs could be substantial  especially if there is significant reluctance to reduce nominal wages. But it is the second part of the central banker stereotype that economists see as most obviously absurd; namely  that the Fed actually controls interest rates and that it knows for sure where the monetary dials ought to be set to achieve a specific growth or unemployment target. The reality is that the Fed controls -- and rather imperfectly at that -- one extremely short-term interest rate  the fed funds rate. The fed funds rate certainly has some influence on banks’ ability to extend credit  but its relation to the longer term rates that really matter to investors and home buyers is uncertain at best. The most that one can say about the Fed’s principal monetary policy tool is that we can safely guess the direction of the effect of moving it and that we know there is a considerable lag between the move and the effect; but we cannot specify with any degree of certainty how large the effect is or how long it takes. That’s a pretty blunt instrument. BIS Review 44/1997 - 3 - Any monetary policy move is a judgment call to be made with a great deal of humility because the judgment involves making a guess about what is likely to be happening to economic activity six months to a year or more in advance and whether resources might be underutilized by then or inflationary pressure might be building. The judgment call seems especially hard at the moment  although I suspect it almost always seems especially hard  because the economy is behaving in ways that are gratifyingly puzzling. The combination of macro-economic statistics is actually more favorable -- more growth  more employment  less budget deficit  less inflation -- than most people would have guessed possible a year or two ago. On one level  these are pleasant surprises; on another level  the behavior of the economy is revealing big challenges for the economics profession. These challenges are not likely to yield to more assiduous statistical manipulation of the same data that we already collect  but instead would require some new tools and new kinds of data. It would be a lot easier to make those judgment calls -- to move the blunt instrument so as to increase the probability of keeping labor markets tight and the economy growing at the highest sustainable rate -- if we knew a lot more about three interrelated questions. 1.What’s really going on in labor markets? 2.What’s really going on with prices? 3.And especially  what’s really going on with productivity? The labor market puzzle is partly why low unemployment is not leading to more obvious bottlenecks  more serious skill shortages and more rapid increases in compensation than we are in fact experiencing? It’s tempting to believe that the uniformity of unemployment rates around the country indicates that the information age is paying off in better functioning labor markets. Possibly  at the equilibrating margin  people now move more easily to jobs  and jobs more easily to people than they once did. Possibly the organizations that worked so hard under the pressure of competition and recession to become less rigid and more flexible have in fact done so. But those are all guesses -- or wishful thinking. We don’t know for sure. The price puzzle is why prices have been so well behaved in the face of labor costs that have been rising  albeit not especially fast. Has the economy  as so many business anecdotes allege  really become more fiercely competitive both nationally and internationally? Is the ability of firms to absorb labor cost increases without raising prices and without apparent reduction in profit margins confirming the hypothesis that productivity is rising faster than we thought  or faster than the admittedly inadequate data have been telling us? Indeed  it is the productivity puzzle that may hold the key to the gratifyingly mysterious behavior of the economy. Economists have thought for some time that the increasing importance of services in the economy is confounding the ability to understand what is happening to both product and productivity. We observed an increase in manufacturing productivity  but not in service productivity. Indeed  measured productivity was generally negative in service industries even where anecdotal evidence indicated that processes had been streamlined  products had been substantially improved  as well as greatly proliferated  and the people in the industry believed they were doing a much more effective job serving their customers. Economists freely admitted they didn’t quite know how to identify and measure the quality of the products that were being produced in service industries  sometimes even in manufacturing. Economists also wondered aloud why all the investment in computers and information technology that was so obviously changing the world was not having an impact on productivity. We opined that maybe people weren’t using computers very well or that many things people were using computers for -- like editing everything to death or spelling things correctly -- were not actually contributing to productivity at least as we were measuring it. Now  we should turn all this speculation BIS Review 44/1997 - 4 - into a full court press to figure out what kind of data we need and what kind of analytical methods we need to invent in order to understand better what is going on in this economy. The need to improve the accuracy of the CPI has captured the attention of the press and the politicians because the indexing of benefits and tax brackets plays such a large part in the federal budget. But the problems of identifying what consumers are buying and how the quality of the items purchased has changed is very closely related to the problem of identifying what is being produced and what inputs are going into the production. The Clinton Administration  to its credit  has recognized the need for improving both the concepts and measurement of prices and products and has asked for a modest increase in resources for the statistical agencies in the President’s budget  even in the context of general budget cuts. Strong support from the users of the data is surely in order -- not just from academic economists  but from the whole community of market analysts  Fed watchers and business and financial organizations who need to understand how the economy is working in order to operate better in it. Indeed  I have been struck since I have been at the Fed by the magnitude of the resources our economy puts into analyzing  reporting and commenting upon the standard set of statistics generated by federal statistical agencies every week -- efforts by the press  the business community and the people in between  such as those who write the newsletters and poop sheets that circulate over faxes and computers. Wouldn’t it be in everyone’s interest to take a portion of those resources and devote them to improving the flow of statistics that are being analyzed to death? Another thought that has struck me at the Fed is the enormous usefulness of reporting on examples of real world happenings -- anecdotes if you will -- and the absence of useful data that bridge the gap between the anecdote or real world case and an aggregate statistical series. One of the unique features of the Federal Reserve is its strong regional structure. The twelve Reserve Banks are very closely tied to the economies of their regions. The Reserve Banks not only supervise and interact with the local commercial banks  but also keep in close touch with the business  farming  labor  and community leadership in their area. They have broadly representative boards and a whole network of advisory committees (as does the Board of Governors itself). This network of contacts and information makes the Reserve Bank presidents very valuable participants in the FOMC discussion. Indeed  the most interesting part of an FOMC meeting is usually the regional round-up from the Bank presidents. This regional network and set of real world interactions has given me more sense of being in touch with the whole economy than I have had in previous economic policy jobs where I was largely dependent on aggregate statistics. I am not proposing government by anecdote and I am aware of the potential dangers of non-random samples. Nevertheless  I have the sense that our understanding of the economy would be greatly advanced if economists could set themselves seriously to the task of systematizing feedback about real world dilemmas being faced and decisions being made in the economy in ways that give a more nuanced and lively picture of what is going on out there than can be gleaned from standard statistical series. Anyway  it’s an exciting time to be an economist and I’m glad to see so many fellow professionals puzzling together over how the economy works and ought to work. BIS Review 44/1997

I. Introduction I am greatly honored to have been invited by the Japan Center for Economic Research to address this distinguished audience. I wish to take this opportunity to first briefly discuss the recent monetary and economic conditions  and then address the current issues regarding the payment and settlement systems in Japan. There have not been many opportunities to discuss payment and settlement on occasions such as this  despite the fact that they are important to all the economic activities of households and firms  and that as a central bank  we are very much involved in the developments in this area. I have not addressed this area partly due to its technical nature  but recently several developments have attracted much attention to the payment and settlement issues in Japan  as in other countries: specifically  pilot projects of electronic money products and the Bank’s plans to abolish the designated-time settlement mode to make real-time gross settlement the only way of settlement on the Bank of Japan Financial Network System (BOJ-NET). The role of the central bank in ensuring a smooth and stable operation of payment and settlement systems has become clearly recognized through the deliberations on the revision of the Bank of Japan Law that have been taking place since last year. The “Report on the Revision of the Bank of Japan Law ” released recently by the Financial System Research Council  an advisory committee to the Minister of Finance  states one of the objectives of the Bank of Japan to be “to ensure smooth fund settlement among financial institutions  thereby contributing to the maintenance of an orderly financial system."" I wish therefore to discuss today the current issues regarding the payment and settlement systems in Japan and also refer to the role of the central bank in those systems  bearing in mind the domestic and overseas trend in these areas. II. Domestic Monetary and Economic Conditions I would like to start by reviewing the recent economic condition and the thinking behind the Bank’s current monetary policy management. With regard to the domestic economic condition  the Bank of Japan judges that a moderate economic recovery continues and that the recovery is gradually becoming firmer. A notable change in the economic condition since the latter half of 1996 is that the decline in external demand  which had been a factor constraining the economic recovery  halted in autumn 1996 following the depreciation of the yen. Recently there has been an upward trend in external demand. In addition  inventory adjustment in some raw materials and semiconductor industries had almost reached completion by the end of 1996. As a result  production has started to grow at an accelerating pace  reflecting fully the increase in final demand. Personal consumption continues to grow moderately but steadily  supported by the buoyant sales of passenger cars  and the recovery in business fixed investment is spreading to a wider range of industries and to smaller firms than previously observed  reflecting improvements in corporate sales and profits. BIS Review 43/1997 - 2 - It should be borne in mind that increase in demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate scheduled for fiscal 1997 is contributing to the recent improvement in economic indicators  as in housing investment  and these improvements need to be seen in this light. However  despite a gradual decrease in public-sector investment from the latter half of 1996  the virtuous circle - in which increased production leads to a recovery in business fixed investment and personal consumption through improved corporate profits and employment income - is gradually becoming more apparent. This improvement is encouraging. In contrast to these recent improvements in economic indicators  the beginning of the year saw a significant fall in stock prices and this  together with the decline in long-term interest rates in the financial markets  indicates that the confidence of the market participants in the economic outlook is still slow to improve. Various causes can be considered for the market’s uncertainty as to future developments in the economy. While the renewed concern over the nonperforming-loan problem of financial institutions may be one important factor  the strong awareness of the effects of the anticipated fiscal tightening in the next fiscal year is also significant. From spring to summer this year  a temporary slowdown in economic recovery seems inevitable due to a reaction to the boost in demand that is occurring ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate. However  given the strengthening of the virtuous circle  it is more likely than before that the recovery trend of the economy will be sustained. In addition  stock prices appear to have stabilized. Therefore  in considering whether the economy can overcome the effects of fiscal tightening to sustain the trend of recovery  it is important to examine macro- and micro-economic data  including the economic indicators that will be released in the future  signals from financial markets  and firms’ business plans for the next fiscal year. I will now turn to the environment surrounding domestic prices. The depreciation of the yen has continued since the beginning of the year  and a rise in the consumption tax rate is planned for April. The raising of the tax rate will be passed on to product prices  pushing up the price index accordingly. However  as long as the price hike does not surpass the increase caused by the raising of the consumption tax rate  the price rise will only reflect a single price adjustment  and will not indicate any fundamental change in the situation underlying prices. Therefore it would not be appropriate to formulate monetary policy to counter such superficial changes in price indexes. From the viewpoint of monetary policy management  that is  the viewpoint of ensuring stable economic development through price stability  the issue of concern is whether the rise in the tax rate will trigger price hikes that take advantage of the increase or will lead to inflationary expectations  which in turn might bring about price rises beyond the immediate effects of the tax rate increase. Whether such a general price increase will occur depends on various factors  including the prevailing domestic supply and demand conditions and consumer confidence. It is thus necessary to pay attention to the inflationary expectations and the possible negative developments  including overreaction by consumers  resulting from the rise in the consumption tax rate  rather than focusing attention on the superficial hikes in prices. Although the decline in prices began to slow from the end of 1996  there is only a limited possibility that domestic prices will take a clear upward path given that improvement in the supply and demand conditions in the domestic economy is expected to remain moderate for now. However  in view of the accelerating rise in import prices reflecting the yen’s depreciation and higher crude oil prices since the latter half of 1996  together with the strengthening of the BIS Review 43/1997 - 3 - recovery in private demand  it remains necessary to pay careful attention to the developments in domestic prices. In the management of current monetary policy  the Bank of Japan will continue to monitor economic developments closely  placing emphasis on further strengthening the foundation of an economic recovery. III. Current Issues Regarding the Payment and Settlement Systems in Japan A. Payment and Settlement Systems in Japan I would now like to move on to the main theme of today’s speech: payment and settlement systems. The expression “payment and settlement systems” may sound somewhat technical and may indeed be unfamiliar to you. In a market economy  however  every economic activity conducted by firms and households - be it production or consumption - is concluded with settlement. Payment and settlement systems  or mechanisms for clearing and settling payments  are therefore used directly or indirectly by every economic entity. People may not be conscious of the functions of the systems when they operate smoothly and efficiently. However  once a problem arises  great difficulties are encountered. The means of payment used by firms and households vary from cash - that is  banknotes and coins - to checks and bills  funds transfers between bank accounts  and credit cards. When payment is made by cash  settlement is final there and then. However  when payment is made by other means such as checks or bills  the mere handing over of the checks and bills will not complete the settlement of the transaction. When a check is drawn  for example  settlement is final only when the check is collected and the stated amount of money is transferred from the deposit money in the bank account of the payer to the bank account of the payee. If such transfers are not effected between accounts for some reason  for example  there are insufficient funds in the payer’s account  the transaction will remain unsettled. When the payer and the payee hold accounts at different banks  interbank settlement is needed  and settlement will be completed only after the corresponding debit and credit entries are made to the current accounts held by each bank with the Bank of Japan. Although various means of payment are available to firms and households  settlement is ultimately made either by a handing over of cash issued by the Bank of Japan or by a transfer of funds between bank accounts using deposit money  which are liabilities of private financial institutions. “Money” in a modern society therefore comprises cash and deposit money  and is reliant on the confidence of the public that bank deposits can be converted into cash at any time. When a large number of relatively small-value payments  such as those using checks and bills  need to be settled between banks  they are not settled one at a time between the accounts held by the banks at the Bank of Japan. Rather  payment instruments such as checks and bills are collected and exchanged at clearing houses  where the credit and debit positions of each bank are calculated  and then the net positions are settled between the BOJ accounts. This calculation process is called clearing  and is operated by private institutions. Specifically  there are three major private clearing systems in Japan: the bill and check-clearing system; the Zengin Data Telecommunications System (Zengin System) for funds transfers between bank accounts and for credit card payments; and the Foreign Exchange Yen Clearing System for yen payments arising from foreign exchange and Euro-yen transactions. BIS Review 43/1997 - 4 - BOJ accounts are used to settle the net positions resulting from various clearing systems  as well as to directly settle large-value interbank funds transactions  such as call-money transactions  which do not go through clearing processes. The value of funds transfers at the Bank of Japan totals approximately ¥300 trillion per day  which is equivalent to approximately 60 percent of Japan’s annual GDP. B. The Role of the Central Bank in Payment and Settlement Systems Bank of Japan thus plays an important role in both the settlement made by cash and the settlement made by deposit money. The duty of central banks is to issue and control money - that is  to ensure the public’s confidence in the holding and the using of money. To this end  two conditions must be satisfied: (1) the value of money must be stable - that is  price stability must be maintained; and (2) the circulation of money and the functioning of payment and settlement systems must be stable and efficient. If it were not possible to use cash and deposits as desired for settlements  people would not be able to hold money with confidence. The mission of central banks  therefore  is to make the currencies they issue more convenient to use and to thereby enable firms and households to confidently engage in daily transactions and funds settlements. Bank of Japan thus plays a vital role in the settlement process in Japan as a whole. Bank of Japan serves two specific functions in securing the stability and efficiency of the country’s payment and settlement systems: (1) providing the means of settlement to the public; and (2) attending to the smooth execution of payments and settlements in Japan. As a provider of the means of settlement  the Bank issues Bank of Japan notes and ensures their smooth circulation. As I mentioned earlier  cash payments immediately complete the settlement of a transaction by delivering a means of payment directly to the counterparty. This on-the-spot completion of settlement  whereby the payee is able to secure the monetary value received  is described as “settlement with finality.” In order to maintain the finality of cash payments  it is essential to secure the confidence of the people in the soundness of the central bank’s assets  which underpins the value of the banknotes. The Bank thus pays close attention to the soundness of its assets. Furthermore  any circulation of counterfeit notes would undermine people’s confidence in holding money. To prevent such an occurrence  the Bank examines the authenticity of the large volumes of banknotes that are returned to the Bank of Japan every day from financial institutions. Careful attention is also paid to the cleanness of each of the banknotes in circulation. The Bank also exerts itself to the utmost to improve anti-counterfeiting measures  and has recently been engaged in joint research with overseas central banks on the prevention of banknote counterfeiting using color copiers. Through such efforts  the Bank aims to preclude the circulation of counterfeits. The Bank also provides current accounts at the Bank as another means of settlement. The Bank offers accounts to private financial institutions  and the funds in these accounts  or deposit money  are equivalent to banknotes in their function as a means of settlement with finality. In order to improve the safety and efficiency of settlements using these BOJ accounts  the Bank has made various efforts  including the introduction of the BOJ-NET - the Bank of Japan Financial Network System  which is an on-line system for funds transfers among the current accounts held by private financial institutions with the Bank of Japan. The BIS Review 43/1997 - 5 - Bank intends to further improve the system in cooperation with those concerned by making real- time gross settlement the only settlement mode  which I shall discuss in detail later. The second function of the Bank of Japan with regard to the payment and settlement systems is to attend to the safety and efficiency of payments and settlements in Japan  and to provide adequate liquidity when necessary. As I mentioned earlier  the important tasks of the Bank include ensuring a smooth supply of banknotes throughout the country  and monitoring the stability of daily settlements across the BOJ accounts. In addition  the Bank  in coordination with the operators of the private clearing systems such as the bill and check clearing  plays an important role in preventing any troubles in the systems or participants from jeopardizing the entire payment and settlement systems in Japan. In any settlement system  there is the risk that a failure of one bank to meet its obligations will trigger a chain reaction of defaults  eventually paralyzing the entire system. In addition  both payment and settlement systems and individual banks constituting the systems are supported by the market’s confidence. As this confidence is in large part a psychological factor  a failure of a single bank could lead to a run on deposits at other banks. Such risk is referred to as systemic risk. Materialization of systemic risk will disrupt not only settlements between banks but also those between firms and households  having a profound impact on the economy and on the society as a whole. Such systemic risk inherent in the network of settlements is what differentiates the banking sector from other industrial sectors. The role of the central bank is to constantly monitor the institutional framework and the operation of payment and settlement systems  working in coordination with the parties concerned to thereby prevent the materialization of systemic risk. The central bank must also ensure that the system can be provided the funds to break the chain reaction of defaults should some emergency occur. Another important task of the central bank is to attend to the soundness of the private financial institutions  which are the participants in the payment and settlement systems and which settle the payments between firms and households. To summarize these roles  an important mission of the central bank is to maintain the safety and efficiency of the entire settlement process  a process which involves (1) private financial institutions which accept the deposits of firms and households; (2) private clearing organizations processing interbank payments; and (3) the central bank which discharges interbank settlement obligations resulting from private-sector clearing systems. C. Measures to Improve the Safety of Payment and Settlement Systems Payment and settlement systems have not necessarily been an issue of public interest reflecting the general perception that these systems are mechanical processing units for discharging obligations by inputting transaction data. The fact that there had been no financial institution failures until recently and that payments have been settled safely may have supported this perception. However  financial institutions have actually failed and the speed at which systemic risk is transmitted within and beyond international borders has increased significantly owing to technological innovations in finance and telecommunications  and financial globalization. Under these circumstances  it is inappropriate to view payment and settlement systems as merely mechanical processing units. These systems must be resilient against systemic risk  and the establishing of such systems is an extremely important challenge for both the private financial institutions and for the central bank. It becomes apparent that various incidents and studies have raised the awareness of the need to improve the safety of payment and settlement systems among private financial institutions and central banks both in Japan and abroad. BIS Review 43/1997 - 6 - In various countries  new safety standards have been applied to private clearing systems. These standards include limits on each participant’s net debit position and collateral requirements to ensure the provision of adequate backup liquidity in the event of an inability to settle by the participant having the largest single net-debit position. These standards were devised by the central banks of the Group of Ten countries as minimum standards to be satisfied by cross-border and multi-currency netting schemes  and are referred to as the Lamfalussy standards  after the chairman of the committee on this study. As these standards can apply to domestic clearing systems  they are being used recently in many countries as guidelines for improving the integrity of private clearing systems. In Japan  it has recently been decided to enhance the safety measures of the Foreign Exchange Yen Clearing System so as to satisfy the Lamfalussy standards. The Bank will continue to actively support the initiatives to improve the safety of the payment and settlement systems. D. Improving the Safety of the Central Bank’s Settlement System - Real-Time Gross Settlement The need to improve safety applies not only to private clearing systems but also to the settlement systems operated by central banks. In this regard  an increasing number of central banks have been adopting real-time gross settlement for current account settlements at the central bank. Real-time gross settlement - called RTGS for short - is a system in which the central bank processes and effects every payment instruction sent by private financial institutions in real time and on an order-by-order basis. Most central banks  including the Bank of Japan  have typically conducted interbank settlements on a designated-time basis rather than by RTGS. In the conventional designated-time settlement  payment instructions are accumulated until designated settlement times instead of each one being settled immediately. At the designated time - at present  9 a.m.  1 p.m.  3 p.m.  and 5 p.m. in Japan - the net settlement position of each financial institution is computed and its account is credited or debited simultaneously. In designated-time settlement  financial institutions need only the funds equivalent to their net debit positions at the time of settlement  and thus  it is an efficient system from the viewpoint of fund management. However  if a single financial institution in the system were to fail to meet its obligations  all payments would inevitably be suspended  in order that all the payment instructions sent or received by that financial institution could be revoked to recompute the settlement obligations of each financial institution. In addition  such failure could create a shortage of funds at the financial institutions which had planned to make payments with the funds they had expected to receive from the failed financial institution. This may lead to a series of liquidity shortages or defaults - that is  the materialization of systemic risk. The effects of this risk could be grave  considering that the amount of funds handled by the central bank’s settlement system is substantial. With RTGS  the smooth execution of settlements solely depends on the ability of the parties concerned to meet their obligations  as every payment instruction is processed in real time on an order-by-order basis. Therefore  even if a bank were to suddenly become unable to settle  disruption to the system would be limited: suspension of the operation of the entire settlement system  which can occur under designated-time settlement  can be avoided. The BIS Review 43/1997 - 7 - introduction of RTGS in many countries around the world  including some Asian countries  is a result of the efforts of central banks to improve their settlement systems to contain systemic risk. Against this background  the Bank of Japan also decided at the end of 1996 to make RTGS the only mode of settlement via BOJ accounts. Specifically  by the end of the year 2000  the Bank plans to abolish designated-time settlement and make all funds transfers on the basis of RTGS. This may require market participants to establish new transaction and settlement practices. To ensure the smooth operation of RTGS  the Bank intends to directly supply intraday liquidity  which is indispensable for smooth settlements  to cover liquidity shortages that might arise in the system despite the efforts of participant financial institutions. Last December  the Bank announced its policy to realize RTGS as the only settlement mode on the BOJ-NET with some specific proposals for design features and requested comments from the public. The Bank was fortunate to receive many valuable comments and recognized the increasing awareness of settlement risk among market participants. The Bank believes that it has been able to gain strong support from the private financial institutions for RTGS  and plans to publish in the near future its policies along with the comments received. The Bank strongly hopes to receive constructive opinions and suggestions in deciding the details of the design of the system. The Bank will also solicit views from a broad range of market participants whenever making a major change in the operation of the Bank’s settlement system  as a change in the system could have a significant impact on the market practices and the daily business of the financial institutions participating in the system. It should be noted that realization of RTGS does not necessarily mean the elimination of all the risks in payment and settlement systems. Moreover  RTGS on the BOJ- NET will produce the desired effects only when the safety of the private clearing systems connected to the Bank’s system is ensured. To illustrate this point  suppose that the private financial institutions  for some reason  switched from direct settlements via BOJ accounts to indirect settlements using private clearing systems given the introduction of RTGS. The total amount of risks in the payment and settlement systems as a whole would not decrease if there were inadequate management of risks in the private systems. In this respect  it is indispensable for the private financial institutions  the private clearing organizations  and the central bank to work together to enhance the efficiency and safety of the payment and settlement systems in Japan. Such efforts of the private sector and the central bank to improve the infrastructure for settlements will also contribute to the strengthening of the global competitiveness of Japan’s financial markets  which is indeed the aim of the Japanese “Big Bang” deregulation package proposed by Prime Minister Hashimoto. E. Improvement in Securities Settlement Systems In addition to the safety of funds settlements  much attention has been paid globally to the safety of settlements of securities such as government securities and stocks. Although I do not have enough time today to discuss this issue in detail  the established guidelines for risk management in securities settlements are the recommendations set out in 1989 by the Group of Thirty  an international group of experts in finance. In accordance with the recommendations  significant progress has been made recently in Japan toward improving the settlement systems for securities. For the settlement of BIS Review 43/1997 - 8 - Japanese government securities (JGS)  for example  an on-line network and delivery-versus- payment system have been established. Delivery versus payment  known as DVP  is a mechanism which links the delivery of JGS with the corresponding funds transfer so that both are executed simultaneously. In such a way  a failure to collect payments or receive securities can be avoided. In addition  rolling settlement was introduced in October 1996. Here  settlements are made on every business day for the contracts that were agreed on a specific number of business days previous to that settlement date (currently seven days). This replaces the prior arrangement where contracts made over a certain period were accumulated before they were settled on one of the six designated settlement days of each month (the 5th  10th  15th  20th  25th  and the last day of the month). The system will be improved further in April 1997 to complete settlement on the third business day after the date of contract. Regarding settlement of corporate bonds  which may be familiar to many of you here  delivery of bonds has conventionally been made by a document called registration certificate and the corresponding payment has been settled separately through clearing of bills. At the end of 1997  however  on-line delivery of corporate bonds will be brought into effect. A delivery-versus-payment service is also envisioned for the future by connecting the settlement system for corporate bonds with the BOJ-NET. Various efforts are thus under way in Japan to enhance the safety of securities settlements. However  much remains to be improved. A large volume of stocks and other securities continues to be delivered physically  and DVP systems are yet to be established for such securities. Furthermore  the lag between the contract and the settlement  that is  the final transfers of securities and funds  needs to be shortened for various securities. In this respect  the Bank intends to contribute actively and expects further efforts on the part of the private sector. F. Developments in Electronic Money I would now like to briefly discuss the developments in electronic money  which might become a popular means of settlement in the future. The term electronic money is used to refer to payment mechanisms in which electronic records of funds are stored in devices such as IC cards - with microprocessor chip (integrated circuits) embedded - or in computer networks and then transferred safely from one customer to another. Many pilot projects are under way in various countries  making use of the recent technological innovations in IC cards and computer networks as well as in such security features as encryption. In Japan as well  financial institutions and firms have begun various projects individually or jointly. For example  some banks are individually using IC-card based electronic money on trial within certain buildings in Tokyo. A joint project by a credit card company and several banks on card-based electronic money is also being planned for summer 1998 in a certain area of Tokyo. It is said to be of the largest one of its kind in the world  involving approximately 1 000 stores and 100 000 cards. When electronic money products become prevalent  they may be used as new means of settlement replacing cash and deposits. People may settle various retail transactions by transferring the electronic values between IC cards or on networks instead of banknotes and coins. To prepare for this possibility  central banks are keenly interested in the soundness and the implications of electronic money developments. From this viewpoint  the central banks of the Group of Ten countries have been studying various aspects of electronic money: security features to prevent fraud and counterfeiting  implications for the effectiveness of the central bank’s monetary policy  and the stability of payment and settlement systems. BIS Review 43/1997 - 9 - At present  however  it is very difficult to project how electronic money technology will develop  to what extent electronic money products will be used by the public as a substitute for cash or deposit money  and at what pace these developments will proceed. The pace of the developments will depend on how the reliability of electronic money products is secured and how conveniently these products are utilized. Under these circumstances  it is not easy to reach a verdict on the various relevant issues  nor would it be appropriate to jump to conclusions. Developers and operators of electronic money schemes can be expected to exercise ingenuity on such aspects as security and legal matters  and the innovative capabilities of the private sector should not be discouraged. The basic stance that the Bank should maintain at present is to be flexible to the various possibilities concerning the future course of development in electronic money. Regarding the implications of the development of electronic money on monetary policy  monetary policy will  in theory  continue to be effective  provided that the situation does not become one where electronic money extensively substitutes not only for cash as a means of retail payment but also for deposit money for large-value transfers. Although the spread of electronic money products might affect the stability of monetary indicators  this will be adequately managed by identifying the amount outstanding of electronic money issued and by devising monetary policy management. Therefore  I wish to state that the Bank of Japan does not intend to put a brake on the development and introduction of electronic money in consideration of its effects on monetary policy. Maintaining this stance  the Bank intends to continue research on electronic money while observing the developments in the private sector in Japan and abroad. It will release the results of the research  as it has done in the past  wishing to support the efforts of the private sector. G. The Necessity of Risk Management by Individual Financial Institutions I have so far discussed the developments regarding payment and settlement systems to contain systemic risk. It is obvious  however  that establishing an appropriate system structure alone is not enough to secure the safety of the systems. It is also important for the system participants  or individual financial institutions  to improve risk control measures by establishing a system for identifying and managing settlement risk. In a modern society  monetary systems  as mentioned earlier  are based on the public’s confidence in: (1) cash issued by the central bank; and (2) deposit money offered by private financial institutions. In order for monetary systems to function smoothly  it is necessary for the financial system as a whole to function with stability and  to that end  financial institutions themselves need to be responsible for securing sound management  including management of settlement risk. It is evident that financial institutions should manage their risks rigorously. Compared to credit and interest rate risks  settlement risk tends to cause greater losses and disruptions once it materializes  and yet they are difficult to identify and manage. In fact  settlement risk constantly fluctuates significantly  and thus identification and management of the risk require comprehensive understanding of technical details related to processing. For example  it is necessary to know how the payment and settlement systems of different currencies work  and what risks arise from time lags. Such information and skills cannot be acquired overnight. However  in view of the impact settlement risk could have on financial institutions  it BIS Review 43/1997 - 10 - is indispensable to establish a system which makes possible the identification and measurement of settlement risk and the immediate reduction of risk following decisions by the management. I would like to emphasize that a financial institution equipped with an efficient risk management system will be able to acquire new business opportunities in the area of payment and settlement services. In fact  many European and U.S. financial institutions are creating and offering new business out of settlement operations. They are putting in large amounts of resources to establish adequate internal risk management  and are developing safe and efficient settlement services to provide to financial institutions and other customers. The fact that such operations are viable as business is an indication that European and U.S. financial institutions and firms actively use new innovative payment and settlement services to realize safe and efficient settlements. IV. Conclusion In summarizing today’s discussion on payment and settlement systems  I would like to address the basic issues from a somewhat different point of view. Firstly  payment and settlement systems play an extremely important role in the economy as an infrastructure supporting all economic activities  although this is rarely acknowledged in our daily lives. When firms purchase raw materials and sell products  or when households receive wages and salaries  purchase goods  and remit money  all these activities are based on the assumption that payments and settlements of money are effected smoothly - in a manner that people would not even be conscious of it. To satisfy this requirement  modern society has developed a complex and precise mechanism comprising the central bank and the private sector. The expressions “financial institutions” and “financial system” may generally bring to mind the function of intermediating savings and investment through the borrowing and lending of money. Providing safe and efficient settlement services  however  is an equally important function that the central bank and the private financial institutions serve. Secondly  efforts to further improve the utility and safety of the settlement systems are becoming all the more important as economic transactions become increasingly complex and globalized and as technological innovations in finance including the payment and settlement systems progress. The Lamfalussy standards  RTGS  and the recommendations of the Group of Thirty are indeed part of such efforts. As technology continues to progress  however  there is no final goal for the development of payment and settlement systems. In addition  financial globalization is intensifying cross-border linkages  with settlement troubles in one country affecting the settlement systems of other countries. It is therefore important for the private sector and central banks to work together to improve the payment and settlement systems by reviewing the safety standards as necessary from a global perspective. We at the Bank of Japan shall continue our efforts to enhance the safety and efficiency of the BOJ-NET  and shall support the efforts of the private sector to improve their systems. Thirdly  it is important to ensure the soundness of the financial system in a broader sense. As I mentioned repeatedly  the functioning of modern monetary systems has its foundations in the public’s confidence in the central bank and the private financial institutions. In order for monetary systems to function properly  the entire financial system needs to operate with stability. Sound management founded on the responsibility of the financial institutions is fundamental in establishing the confidence in private financial institutions. It is necessary for BIS Review 43/1997 - 11 - the central bank to function as the lender of last resort should a trouble which emerged in one part of the settlement system be anticipated to spread throughout the entire system - although it is important to contain such risks in advance  sometimes it may unfortunately become impossible to prevent an incident from having impact on the entire system - so that people’s everyday lives will not be seriously affected. In order to prevent the materialization of systemic risk  it is essential for the central bank to assess  through regular on-site examinations and daily monitoring  whether the soundness of individual financial institutions is secured  whether there is excessive concentration of risks in the financial system as a whole  and whether the series of transactions between financial institutions is being settled smoothly. In summary  payment and settlement systems are vital to every economic entity including the firms and individuals represented here. As the central bank  one of whose missions is to secure the soundness of the financial system  the Bank of Japan will continue its efforts to improve the safety and efficiency of Japan’s payment and settlement systems. In this regard  your suggestions and comments will be extremely valuable. Thank you very much for your kind attention. This article is excerpted and translated from a speech given by Yasuo Matsushita  Governor of the Bank of Japan  to the Japan Center for Economic Research in Tokyo on February 28  1997. BIS Review 43/1997"
r970502e,1997-05-02,https://www.bis.org/review/r970502e.pdf,Mr. Erçel explains developments in the Turkish economy that help in understanding the country's market opportunites (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  3 Apr 97),Speech by the Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey  Mr. Gazi Erçel  on the occasion of the Conference on 'Private provision of infrastructure in Turkey' held at çiragan Palace in Istanbul on 3/4/97.,Mr. Erçel explains developments in the Turkish economy that help in understanding the country’s market opportunites Speech by the Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey  Mr. Gazi Erçel  on the occasion of the Conference on “Private provision of infrastructure in Turkey” held at Çiragan Palace in Istanbul on 3/4/97. For a comprehensive understanding of the opportunities offered by Turkey’s market  I should stress the implications of our journey toward liberalisation. In 1980  with world conditions changing and the domestic economy in crisis  Turkey launched a structural adjustment program based on free market principles and an outward-looking economic policy. Since then  a series of liberalisation measures have been taken. The most significant accomplishment of the Turkish liberalisation process is that it has restructured economic relations. Both the financial system and the foreign exchange system have been liberalised. Before discussing Turkey’s economic performance  I would like to describe some features of our foreign exchange system and financial system. Let me begin with the foreign exchange system. Efforts to liberalise Turkey’s balance of payments go all the way back to the Great Depression  and ever since the 1930’s  the issue has been whether to liberalise the current account or the capital account. Now these questions have been settled. Let me summarise the state of the foreign exchange regime under five headings: 1. Residents are permitted to buy  sell  and use foreign exchange freely. 2. Residents are also allowed to purchase  through authorised financial institutions  shares quoted on foreign stock markets  and are permitted to transfer foreign exchange abroad to pay for purchases of such securities. 3. By the same token  non-residents are allowed to buy and sell Turkish securities quoted on the Turkish stock market. They are also allowed to buy and sell Turkish government securities through intermediary institutions operating in Turkey. 4. A substantial part of the controls on capital movements were removed  greatly easing inflows and outflows of credit. Turkey has accepted the provisions of Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement. 5. To avoid excessive risks for the banks  new regulations were adopted governing the foreign exchange position of the commercial banks. The banks are free to set their own rates for buying and selling foreign exchange. Our foreign exchange system  described above  is very convenient for foreign capital flows. Now let me describe the main characteristics of our financial system. Even though our efforts to liberalise the financial system did not begin until 1980  the Istanbul Exchange Market has existed and operated since 1858. It grew out of the activities of Non-Muslim bankers in the Galata district of Istanbul. These operators  mostly Levantines  Jews  Armenians  and Greeks  used to risk their own capital by extending credit to the government  secured by pledges of future tax collections. Even though during the early years of the Exchange Market’s operation in the 1860’s  the amount of foreign direct investment in Turkey was negligible  foreign capital was being encouraged to form joint stock companies. Up until the beginning of the 20th century  the Market helped the government find funds to finance its obligations. In 1906  the Istanbul Exchange Market was re-organised and once more became a source of new capital for young private ventures. BIS Review 42/1997 - 2 - Without giving the whole history of the Istanbul Exchange Market  I want to emphasise that Turkey’s experience with free markets did not begin in 1980 but goes back more than a century before. What the reforms of 1980 did accomplish was to institutionalise the markets and put them on a solid legal footing. Besides liberalisation  the structural reforms begun in 1980 included measures providing investment and tax incentives. I would like to review these issues briefly. The aims of these incentives were to encourage activities that would earn foreign exchange on the one hand  and to help foreign sources of capital finance investments in Turkey on the other. It can be said that by liberalising its capital account and introducing structural tax changes to improve investment returns  Turkey issued an invitation to foreign capital. Under these new arrangements  the tax incentives aimed at deepening the securities market and encouraging investment in it are of two kinds: - Double taxation of dividends was prevented by raising the corporate income tax rate and making it the only tax on dividend income. In addition  the income tax rate for small shareholders was lowered. - For residents  capital gains on shares became exempt from taxation if the security was listed on an exchange. Capital gains from the sale of through licensed intermediaries were made tax free. Premiums from the issuance of stock are also tax free for stocks listed on a stock exchange that does not distribute dividends to shareholders. There are also tax facilities for government securities. Privatization is an important part of our modernisation and liberalisation effort. Turkey embarked on a privatization program in the 1980s. Turkey’s telecommunications and energy sectors are great targets for global partnership. Despite extensive exemptions from the program  by 1994 total proceeds derived from privatization since it began in 1986 had reached US$2.4 billion  which is not so bad. Moreover  25 percent of this total came from sales on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. More than 60 percent of the sales were direct sales to domestic and international buyers. The main purpose of privatization is to get the government out of the business of business and increase the efficiency of the privatised enterprises. Let me follow this account of the general framework of regulation governing financial investments denominated in foreign exchange with a description of the structure  strengths and weaknesses of our economy. The basic economic features of our country are attractive. A liberal trade and exchange rate regime  a modern and competitive private sector  abundant and vigorous consumer demand  and extremely attractive investment opportunities. This rosy picture is clouded by three economic problems that can be solved by a firm commitment to macroeconomic discipline. These three problems--high and persistent inflation  high public sector deficits  and large current account imbalances--are interrelated. Persistent high inflation has been Turkey’s main economic problem for the last two decades. Its main cause lies in the sizeable public deficit. Its other causes include entrenched inflationary expectations  exchange rate movements  monetary developments  interest rates  and price increases initiated by public enterprises. Under conditions of an open capital account  large public deficits can generate imbalances in the current account. Turkey’s current account tends to be volatile. For this reason  what Turkey really needs is to accept fiscal discipline. A sustainable and consistent fiscal policy is evidently the key to solving other economic problems. Achieving fiscal discipline will require political will as well as persistence. BIS Review 42/1997 - 3 - Even though we have economic problems  we unquestionably also have the ability to overcome them. Turkey needs to make use of this potential. I therefore now wish to draw your attention to the considerable strengths of our economy. For purposes of this discussion  I will split our economy in two--the real economy and the financial economy. Let me begin my explanation of the present structure of the economy with real variables. - The Turkish economy is a continuously growing  dynamic economy. Its long- term average annual growth rate is over 4 percent and its average annual productivity increase is around 2 percent. In each of the last two years  GNP has increased by around 7 percent  well above most OECD countries. Along with this rapid growth  the composition of the gross domestic product (GDP) has shifted during the last two decades  toward the industrial and services sectors  while the GDP share of agriculture has greatly declined. The share of the public sector in industrial output has also decreased. - Spending on investments has been increasing since the first quarter of 1995. Normally  periods of investment aimed at increasing production capacity last for about 20 months  but the increase in investment activity spending remained focused on increasing production capacity throughout 1995 and 1996. The Economic Trend Analysis of the Central Bank of Turkey shows that no earlier period of expectation of rising investments has ever lasted longer. - Official records show that Turkey’s unemployment rate has been holding fairly constant at around 7 or 8 percent  which is very low compared to the other OECD countries. In April 1996  total employment rose by 2.6 percent and unemployment fell to 6.3 percent. The urban and rural unemployment rates were estimated at 9.3 percent and 3.8 percent respectively. In addition  Turkey was among the top ten countries in terms of improving its score on the United Nations’ human resource development index  which is based on a country’s literacy rate  per capita income  and life expectancy. Of course  such a nation-wide measurement takes no account of the wide differences between urban and rural conditions. Be that as it may  the strong growth of the working age population  the high degree of urbanisation  and increased numbers of well-educated young workers are all favourable to strong growth in labor productivity. - Turkey has a strong  dynamic and competitive private sector. The non- agricultural private sector recovered quickly from the financial crises in spite of unsettled political conditions and extremely high interest rates. In addition  it is the private sector that has been mainly responsible for capital formation. · - There have been interesting developments connected with Turkey’s foreign exchange earnings. Even though the official trade account and current account figures reflect sizeable deficits  I would like to emphasise that the level of merchandise exports is significantly understated due to its omission of rapidly growing but unrecorded “shuttle” trade with neighbouring countries. We are on the verge of being able to include these activities in our balance of payments figures. In addition  there has been serious underreporting of the value of transactions connected with some of Turkey’s foreign direct investments  a problem that the Central Bank is working to resolve. Now let me touch briefly on Turkey’s financial system. Turkey’s financial sector is still dominated by the banking sector. In other words  most financial savings are channelled through the banking sector. The banking sector’s total assets amount to 66 percent of GNP. The BIS Review 42/1997 - 4 - reformation of the financial sector had the effect of reinforcing the privileged position of the banks. Turkey has a universal banking system  which is another way of saying that Turkish banks are allowed to participate directly in all forms of financial activity except insurance. The Banking Act of 1985 governs the establishment of banks  their capital structure  branch banking  foreign banking  credits  deposit insurance  and all other activities related to banking. Today our banking sector is highly competitive and efficient. It is integrated with the international financial markets. Its strength is based on an up-to-date technical infrastructure  a well-educated work force and experienced  and a well-qualified management. The banking sector’s adaptability  shown by its rapid introduction into the system of new financial instruments  has increased the available range of financing sources. Financial reform has increased the efficiency and competitiveness of our banking sector. The Istanbul Stock Exchange is one of the best performing of all the emerging markets. Its total market capitalisation is increasing  both in nominal terms and as a percentage of GNP  which indicates that it is playing an increasing role in the transmission of domestic financial savings. The GNP share of market capitalisation has increased to 22 percent  while the GNP share of M2y  which is the total of financial savings held in the banking sector  is around 40 percent. In addition  the return of the Istanbul Stock Exchange  though volatile  increased substantially this year. Market volatility creates liquidity and great trading opportunities. When I talk about money markets I mean the Turkish lira money market and the foreign exchange cash and deposit market  open market operations  and government securities auction markets. These markets  which were introduced as a part of the financial sector reforms  have increased the effectiveness of the central bank’s control over the liquidity in the financial system  and increased the role of market mechanisms in money management. When market mechanisms began to play a larger part in the allocation of resources  the responsibilities and instruments of the central bank also changed  bringing the issue of central bank autonomy onto the agenda of the Turkish economy. Turkey now has a well established and efficient system of financial markets. The main obstacle at present to the functioning of the financial markets is our large public sector borrowing requirement  which crowds out other demands for financing. The inability of domestic resources to cover the financing needs of the public sector has kept real interest rates very high for over a decade. Bold privatization efforts  broadening the tax base  and reforming the social security system are the best ways to correct this situation  and I may say that they are all under way. Macroeconomic stability and political stability are the keys to achieving sustainable growth in a low inflation environment. BIS Review 42/1997

Wellink  an Executive Director of the Netherlands Bank  on the occasion of AEGEE’s EMU campaign 1997  delivered in Rotterdam on 16/4/97. If everything goes according to schedule  the Economic and Monetary Union - EMU  in short - will start on 1st January 1999. As of that date  the central banks of countries which are part of EMU at that time will join the European Central Bank (ECB)  to be located  as you know  in Frankfurt. From then on  this institution will conduct a monetary policy aimed primarily at stabilising the internal value of the future single European currency  the euro. When the euro is officially initiated on 1st January 1999 - and I have no doubt that it will - a process will have been completed which can be considered unique from various points of view. Firstly  because the euro will become the pre-eminent symbol of economic and monetary union which is taking shape between sovereign states abolishing their national currency in exchange for a single currency. Secondly  because when it is introduced  the euro will not immediately be both a unit of account and means of payment: on 1st January 1999 the euro will become the unit of account  whereas it will not begin to circulate as a concrete  physical means of payment until three years later  on 1st January 2002. Finally  and befitting the age we live in  because the euro will be the first single currency which is available in electronic form right from the start. Hence  the euro marks the completion of a process which is unique from a historical perspective. It is this process which I want to discuss with you this afternoon. Not so much because I was asked to give an outline of economic and monetary cooperation as from the Treaty of Rome to the present day  but particularly to outline the near future. Outlines which are essential to make the euro a lasting success. Travelling from Rome to Amsterdam  where the Maastricht Treaty will shortly be reviewed  we will have to make several stopovers. 1. From Rome to The Hague There is nothing new about the pursuit of a single European currency. Ideas about a single currency are mainly rooted in idealistic-political motives. When a single European currency was propagated in the past  this was usually done in the form of a plea in favour of a politically united Europe. This idea was also expressed shortly after the end of World War II. It was Winston Churchill  who in 1946 in Zürich  argued in favour of “a kind of United States of Europe”. In April of that same year  the need for a single European currency was voiced by the new post-war President of the Nederlandsche Bank  Marius Wilhelm Holtrop  who wanted a strong and sound guilder which in due course would merge into one European currency. The past fifty years have shown  that the advent of a single European currency will certainly not include the “United States of Europe” that Churchill was talking about. Soon after 1946  Europe became politically divided into Eastern and Western hemispheres due to the Cold War. With the foundation of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957  Western Europe took the lead by starting economic cooperation. The objective of the Treaty of Rome  on which the EEC was based  was to create a common market between France  West Germany  Italy and the Benelux countries. This objective resulted in a customs union which became effective on 1 July 1968. However  the Treaty remained vague about other aspects of economic cooperation. Economic policy  for example  was considered a matter of common interest. As BIS Review 42/1997 - 2 - regards monetary cooperation  coordination was recommended  the exchange rate policy being regarded as a matter of common interest as well. The plan for economic integration designed in Rome was not an objective in itself. It was based on political grounds. After all  the Treaty aimed at achieving an “ever closer union among the European peoples” through economic integration. During the 1969 summit in The Hague  representatives of the six Member States agreed with the idea of the newly elected German Chancellor Willy Brandt that this had to be realised via Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The then Prime Minister of Luxembourg  Paul Werner  came up with a detailed plan that was named after him. According to this plan  EMU would be materialised in stages. In the final stage  monetary and budgetary competences of the national states were to be transferred to Community bodies established for that purpose. And so  Werner’s ideas were considerably more far-reaching than the agreements reached in Rome thirteen years earlier. Nonetheless  the philosophy of economic integration advocated in Rome remained the moving spirit behind political cooperation: “it is true that we need not achieve a European confederation or federation tomorrow. But to arrive at this ultimate goal  we must first take the step of creating an economic and monetary currency union”  Werner said at a press conference at the time. In the Europe of the Six  France and Germany played a leading role right from the start. Nonetheless  during the preparation of the Werner Report  both countries differed in view about the aim of integration. So there is nothing new under the sun. For the German Minister Karl Schiller  EMU was inextricably connected to the idea of a political union. France  personified by Raymond Barre  considered this idea of political union far too drastic. Fixing the exchange rates was as far as he wished to go for the time being  hoping that this would make economic integration inevitable. Due to political pressure exerted by France  the final date of EMU was left open in the end. On 1 January 1971  the first phase commenced. It was to last three years  and in this period the Member States would aim at narrowing the fluctuation margin of the exchange rate between their currencies. The first phase however started under unfavourable circumstances. In August 1971  turmoil on the international foreign exchange markets forced the US Administration to suspend the convertibility of the dollar. This jeopardised the international exchange rate system of Bretton Woods. At the end of 1971  it was agreed to devalue the dollar and to broaden the exchange rate margins of the currencies participating in the international exchange rate system from 0.75 to 2.25% on either side of the dollar parity. Needless to say that under these circumstances  it became extremely doubtful  whether the first phase of EMU could be heralded. For that reason  the EC Member States agreed in March 1972 to limit the exchange rate fluctuations between their currencies vis-à-vis each other to 2.25%. This is how the “snake in the tunnel” originated  soon to become the “snake in the lake“ when the dollar started to float as from August 1973. This was the final blow to the Bretton Woods System. 2. From The Hague to Maastricht In the 1970s  cooperation in Western Europe was characterised by the priority given to enlarge the Community over deepening. At the beginning of 1973  the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark joined the Economic Community. Reviewing policy coordination between the original Six at that time  the European Commission came to the conclusion that it had been insufficient in this first stage. Therefore  “the“ second phase was changed into “a” second stage in early 1974. In the following years  the lack of policy coordination frequently led to new exchange rate crises  although these were fuelled by external BIS Review 42/1997 - 3 - circumstances as well  including two oil crises. The most striking reaction came from France  which left the snake in early 1974  returned to it in July 1975  and left again in March 1976. The seriousness of the situation was aptly described by the Frenchman Robert Mariolin  who characterised the integration process as follows: “... if there has been any movement  it has been backward: national economic and monetary policies have never in 25 years been more discordant  more divergent than they are today”. The discussion about how Europe should proceed was set off in early 1978 by Roy Jenkins  chairman of the European Commission at the time. After it appeared that a committee established by Jenkins made little progress  the German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and the French President Giscard d’Estaing joined forces. These two politicians demonstrated how quickly plans can be turned into action when backed up by political will and determination. In March 1979  only a few months after they had met  the European Monetary System (EMS) entered into force  which aimed at creating a “zone of monetary stability”. The EMS marked the introduction of the European Currency Unit (ECU) as single unit of account and as starting point for the new exchange rate system. Yet it was no more than a technical arrangement. After all  monetary stability has a chance to succeed only if the economies of the participating countries achieve sustainable convergence and the governments of these countries pursue stability-orientated macroeconomic policies. However  that point had not been reached yet. By conducting a policy which gave high priority to fighting unemployment  France opposed the primacy Germany had attached to price stability since 1945. A large number of exchange rate adjustments were required to make France realise in 1983 that a radical turnabout was necessary. France’s adoption of a policy of the “hard” franc was a move in the direction of the German objective of price stability. The calming effect of this turnabout within the EMS  was enhanced when an agreement was reached in the Danish city of Nyborg on monetary policy adjustments which were needed in the event of exchange rate tensions. In the meantime  the expansion of the Community had widened further. Greece joined in 1981  followed by Spain and Portugal in 1986. In the decision-making process regarding the EMS  EMU was not explicitly formulated as the system’s objective. The Delors Report  which was published in April 1989  contained concrete proposals to that end. According to Delors  fixed and unchangeable exchange rates should be the core of EMU. This implied a single monetary policy  to be conducted by a European central bank which had to ensure that domestic price stability would be maintained. The road to EMU was to be completed in three stages which were  however  not subject to expiry dates. As did Werner  Delors thought that EMU could be realised within a period of ten years. An important difference was that Delors did not propose a transfer of national fiscal competences to the Community. Delors’ plan had a sequel in June 1989  when it was agreed that an Intergovernmental Conference would be held to decide about the necessary amendments to the Treaty of Rome. Six months later  the French-German proposal to hold a conference about political cooperation was accepted in Dublin. At both conferences  preparations were made that led to the Treaty on European Union (EU) at the end of 1991  better known as the Maastricht Treaty. From the tensions that characterised the EMS in the early 1990s  it seemed to be clear that the first stage of EMU did not go entirely as planned. The uncertainties in countries such as Denmark and the United Kingdom which hesitated to sign the Maastricht Treaty  the interest-increasing effect of the unification of Germany  and the fact that the exchange rates of some currencies had become overvalued since Nyborg  culminated in August 1993 in the BIS Review 42/1997 - 4 - decision to broaden the fluctuation margins of the EMS currencies from ± 2.25% to ± 15%  except for the Deutsche Mark and the guilder which maintained the original margin of ± 2.25%. Despite this setback  the European leaders were determined not to allow further delays on the road to EMU mapped out by Delors. This determination was also prompted by external circumstances which  contrary to the 1970s  now had a positive impact on developments. The collapse of the Berlin Wall in October 1989 ended the political division in Europe. This opened the door to the reunification of East and West Germany  of which the Deutsche Mark had meanwhile become the anchor of stability within the EMS. These changes  which coincided with worldwide deregulation of capital transactions  increased the necessity of forming a front in Western Europe. At rapid pace  the Member States of the Community worked to realise the single market  which was as good as completed on 1st January 1993. A logical complement to this single market was the single currency. However  the acceleration of the integration process was not based on economic motives alone. In political terms  the Maastricht Treaty has sometimes been interpreted as a kind of trade-off: West and East Germany were allowed to unite provided this locomotive would continue to pull European economic and monetary unification at a rapid pace in order to hedge the feared German supremacy in the new Europe. Be this as it may  the Treaty officially entered into effect in November 1993  harbouring the prospect of a single European currency. On 1st January 1994  Europe stepped into the second stage of EMU and the European Monetary Institute (EMI)  the forerunner to the ECB  was established in Frankfurt. The EMI’s primary task is to strengthen the coordination of monetary policy between the EU Member States - in early 1995  Finland  Austria and Sweden joined the EU - and to prepare the third stage of EMU. As mentioned  EMU cannot be seen separate from the wish to establish  in the longer term  a politically unified Europe as well. In order to prevent economic reality from being subordinated to this more than honourable wish  stringent entry requirements were set. These so called convergence criteria pertain to permissible values for inflation rates  interest rates  public deficits and public debts. The Maastricht Treaty does not hold the ultimate wisdom. Economic theory has not yet advanced to a level where it can objectively and accurately determine the optimal size of public deficits and debts. It probably never will. The Maastricht budgetary criteria  which are criticised from various sides - some arguing that the entry requirements are too stringent  others believing them to be too lenient - are based on practical experience and  put in a longer historical perspective  are too lenient rather than overly stringent. This is another reason why these criteria must be stringently applied. 3. From Maastricht to Amsterdam The last stage that I want to complete in this introduction  is the journey from Maastricht to Amsterdam. On 16 and 17 June  Amsterdam will host the biannual European summit  where the Maastricht Treaty could well be transformed into the Amsterdam Treaty. It is worth mentioning to foreign guests present here this afternoon that  from a geographical perspective  Maastricht is the last and only real mountain to be conquered on the road to Amsterdam. In other words  the journey from Maastricht to Amsterdam is free of obstacles. I hope that the same applies to the last stage of EMU. The likelihood of obstacles has been reduced considerably because  as I have explained  stringent entry requirements were set in Maastricht. Gradually  a group of countries is emerging in Europe which may be able to meet these criteria. In the spring of 1998  they will be formally appointed as EMU participants. In order to give sufficient weight to this core group  the participation of France and Germany - forming as they do the axis of Western European cooperation - is a prerequisite. But with a view BIS Review 42/1997 - 5 - to the credibility of EMU  France and Germany  in particular  have to strictly observe the conditions of accession. The creation of a core group gives rise to continuous speculations about the question which countries will join it. In this stage of EMU  such speculations are not productive. Instead of excluding countries in advance  each country should be stimulated to do its utmost to complete the budgetary consolidation process. Of course  this does not call for tricks or non- recurring measures  but requires  - as stated in the Maastricht Treaty - a sustainable and therefore permanent consolidation  not only in the interest of EMU but also in the interest of the country involved. Apart from the question which EU countries will be in the core group  participation in EMU implies at any rate that the country involved transfers its monetary policy powers to an independent ECB. In that field  we will continue to see rearguard action  because the tradition of central bank independence is not equally rooted across the whole of Europe. On the other hand  one should not worry about these recurring discussions too much  as the Treaty is rock-solid with regard to the prohibition to exert political influence on the ECB Governing Council. Obviously  the independence of the European Central Bank should not be confused with a lack of democratic legitimacy. After all  the democratic legitimacy of the ECB has been safeguarded in many ways. For example  the designated ECB-President can be questioned by the European Parliament and the chairman of the Council of Ministers plus a member of the European Commission may participate in meetings of the ECB Executive Board without  it is true  voting rights. But apart from this  it should be kept in mind that the Masstricht Treaty has been ratified by the national parliaments. In other words  the ECB’s task to achieve price stability is based on a democratic decision of the national parliaments. The fact that the other forms of policy will remain the responsibility of national authorities may make EMU unique  but fragile too  e.g. if no measures are taken to guarantee that national competences are not abused. Fortunately  European leaders have agreed to the stability pact proposed by Germany. This pact will enable EMU to impose sanctions on EMU Member States whose public finance is not in order. The Netherlands has always been a strong proponent of this proposal  because it is an important instrument to guarantee budgetary discipline. After all  the budgetary policies of the participants will have to be aligned in such a way that they may be used to strengthen the European currency. But even then major efforts will have to be made to clear the road to EMU of any remaining obstacles. The Intergovernmental Conference which started a year ago and will be completed in Amsterdam  will have to provide an answer to the question how the EU can remain institutionally manageable when a number. of Eastern European countries accede in the near future. Answers are also required to the questions regarding more effective decision-making and the role which the European Parliament could play in that respect. Of course  these issues do not have to stand in the way of establishing EMU in 1999. Nevertheless  they show that the long-term success of EMU as part of the EU is not guaranteed until  more so than in the past  the widening of the Union runs parallel to a deepening in the direction of an “ever closer union among the European peoples”  as envisaged by the signatories to the Treaty of Rome. Ladies and Gentlemen With Amsterdam as the last station on this trip  I have arrived at the conclusion of my address. In short  it may be argued that the process of European economic and monetary cooperation from 1957 to the present has been one of trial and error or - analogous to our train journey - of stopping and moving on. Nonetheless  the fact remains that the journey  also thanks BIS Review 42/1997 - 6 - to visionary  creative and energetic drivers  has always been resumed with greater speed  and that the problems encountered were resolved in an inventive  not always perfect  but workable way. This  I think  is the power underlying the post-war European drive towards integration and it is this power which makes me confident that the euro will arrive in due time. If the Treaty of Amsterdam is realised  the switches are definitively turned and the signal will be at clear for the final stage of EMU  which will lead to Frankfurt and can be completed on a beaten track in the high-speed train.

Economic developments in recent years In the past few years Swedish economic policy has achieved tangible results. By an improvement in credibility  important progress has been made towards greater economic stability. Favourable economic growth in Sweden has been combined with a rate of inflation that is the lowest for several decades. There is broad political agreement in Sweden on the consolidation of government finance. This is manifested in the so called convergence programme that aims to eliminate the budget deficit not later than 1998. The budget reinforcements which the Government and the Riksdag (Sweden’s parliament) have undertaken in recent years are extensive. The six-monthly monitoring arrangement provides a means of ensuring that government finance is developing as planned. Moreover  in the Economic Bill this spring the Government states that the long-term target for the general Government budget is a surplus of 2 per cent of GDP as a cyclical average. The gradual adjustment to this goal is also specified. The general government financial balance has been strengthened from - 12.3 per cent of GDP in 1993 to -2.5 per cent in 1996. This is a substantial improvement. The Government calculates that in 1997 the deficit will be 2.1 per cent and that the target of eliminating it in 1998 will be achieved. • With the improved confidence in budget and monetary policy  together with the tighter interest rate policy from the second half of 1994 up to the end of 1995  it has been possible to check the earlier inflationary tendencies and bring inflation expectations down appreciably. Sweden is now among the countries in Europe with the lowest inflation rate regardless of which measure one uses. This  in turn  paved the way for a gradual lowering of our main instrumental rate - the repo rate - in 1996. • What used to be an almost chronic deficit on current account has now been turned into a substantial surplus. This is reducing Sweden’s external debt  which also contributes to greater financial stability. Many structural measures have been implemented since the late 1980s. There are signs that  together with economic policy’s focus on stability  this has reduced the economy’s inflation propensity and raised potential output. Against this background  the direction of Sweden’s economic policy contrasts sharply with the unstable  inflationary path we experienced in the 1970s and ’80s and which contributed to the recession in the early ’90s  which was the worst for over sixty years. BIS Review 47/1997 A new direction in economic policy - 2 - The 1970s and ’80s illustrate how a period of inflation creates an atmosphere of uncertainty and instability  with a speculative climate and “short-termism” in economic decisions. Slowly but surely  production’s long-term conditions deteriorate. It was partly in the light of such experiences that Swedish economic policy was realigned at the turn of the 1980s. Since then  the focus on price stability has gained broad support in our society  including the political parties. However  in view of the severe economic problems in the early 1990s  with inflation expectations based on our historical record and a massive budget deficit  it took time for the new direction of economic policy to acquire credibility. This has been evident  for instance  in the periods of interest and exchange rate unrest. Financial market trends particularly in the longer run can be regarded as an indicator of the prevailing degree of confidence in the determination and ability to conduct an economic policy that is consistent and oriented towards stability. With the free movement of capital and the globalisation of financial markets  economic policy decision-makers need to be highly disciplined. In the light of our experience since the policy realignment at the turn of the ’80s  this is a fact that is widely recognised today in Sweden. Turning the clock back would not be feasible. Experience from other countries  where the policy realignment had already been made in the early 1980s  indicates that the creation of confidence in a low inflation regime takes time and a lot of hard work. But it also shows that after a while  such a process does yield its reward in the form of low interest rates  a stable currency and ultimately a favourable economic development. The price stability target Following the move to a flexible exchange rate  monetary policy in Sweden is directed at a quantified inflation target. In this it resembles the situation for monetary policy in Australia  Canada  New Zealand and the United Kingdom  where inflation targets are also used. In Sweden the target is formulated as being to limit the increase in the consumer price index to 2 per cent. This target is to be assessed  not in terms of isolated twelve-month change figures but in a somewhat longer  annual  perspective. As monetary policy obviously cannot control price developments exactly  the target is accompanied by a tolerance interval of ±1 percentage point. This tolerance interval also serves to absorb temporary deviations from trend inflation. Such deviations may arise  for instance  from political decisions to alter indirect taxes and subsidies  changes in interest rates as well as from international price shocks. For March 1997 the consumer price index showed a twelve-month fall of 0.4 per cent. However  this figure was to a large extent influenced by last year’s sharp repo rate cuts. When home owners renew mortgage loans at lower interest rates we get a transitory downward effect on inflation. It is important to distinguish between CPI changes and underlying inflation. Transitory effects  for example changes in interest rates or in indirect taxes and subsidies  may cause the general price level to jump up and down. In the conduct of monetary policy it is BIS Review 47/1997 - 3 - therefore important to keep an eye on underlying inflation; the transitory effects are of secondary significance as long as they do not affect inflation expectations and thereby trend inflation. Given the time lag that applies to monetary policy  a central bank that targets inflation has to monitor the various factors which determine inflation one to two years ahead. In a simple analysis of inflation’s determinants one can start from the familiar augmented Phillips curve. The rate of inflation is determined by two factors: the relationship between supply and demand in the economy - the output gap - and inflation’s expected rate. Note  however  that while the output gap is a useful starting point for an inflation analysis  there is no simple way of measuring it. This makes it necessary to go into more detail and study a variety of indicators in order to analyse any tensions between demand and supply. Still  the output gap is a suitable starting point for my present purpose. The simple model tells us that when the output gap is closed  inflation is constant and equal to the expected rate. This means that  with normal capacity utilisation and given a low level of inflation expectations  actual GDP can follow potential output. In such a situation some form of external shock is needed to shift inflation upwards or downwards. This can mean either that production falls below or rises above the level for normal capacity utilisation or that inflation expectations move up or down. The latter case is ultimately a matter of confidence in economic policy’s consistency and its future reactions. The ability of monetary policy to influence inflation has to do with the impact of the instrumental rate on the path of GDP and thereby on the degree of capacity utilisation  together with its effect on inflation expectations. In practice a period of restricted demand has frequently been necessary for the central bank to show that expectations of high inflation are unfounded. Besides monetary policy  expectations are affected by other factors. One of these is the budget. Unsustainably large budget deficits are liable to undermine confidence in long-term price stability. Our inflation forecast serves as a foundation for decisions about monetary conditions. If monetary policy is directed at stabilising inflation at 2 per cent  it will over time help to stabilise demand so that this is in line with the economy’s available capacity. In order to clarify our line of reasoning and our inflation assessments  the Riksbank publishes an inflation report four times a year. A range of indicators is reviewed in these reports  accompanied by a discussion of risks and opportunities in the field of inflation. The present situation In the latest inflation report  published this March  GDP growth in 1997 and 1998 was expected to be around 2 and 3 per cent  respectively. It was also argued that sizeable capacity restrictions should not arise in the course of the period. Given that  and inflation expectations being low  underlying domestic inflation (measured with the CPI excluding transitory effects on inflation) in the coming two years was put at between 1.5 and 2 per cent. As we all know  to forecast inflation is a complicated task. In view of the shortcomings in such estimates  it is more a matter of assessing the balance of risks. Our latest BIS Review 47/1997 - 4 - inflation report therefore includes a discussion of two alternatives in which future inflation might be either lower or higher than in the main scenario. One alternative is that inflation could be lower than in the main scenario  mainly if private consumption were to be weak. The other envisages the opposite - higher inflation - on account of a weaker exchange rate that stimulates a stronger growth of exports and GDP  leading to increased inflationary pressure. What are the economic tendencies that have appeared during the last months? During winter there were signs of a slowdown in manufacturing. The December survey from the National Institute of Economic Research showed an unchanged inflow of orders and expectations of subdued production. The order statistics from Statistics Sweden  which fluctuate fairly widely from month to month  gave the impression of relatively weak orders in the fourth quarter of 1996. In December and January  however  the order inflow has picked up and more recent survey data likewise paint a brighter picture of activity in manufacturing. The improvement mainly applies to production for export but even the domestic market is somewhat optimistic about the future. Against this background  exports and industrial production could develop somewhat better than expected earlier. The changes are not very large but to date various indicators  including the continued undervaluation of the krona  do point in the same direction. In the case of private consumption  the indicators to date are not uniform. On the one hand  in the first three months of 1997 the number of new car registrations for private individuals has risen in annual terms by more than 60 per cent  albeit from a low level. Moreover  the survey of household purchasing plans by Statistics Sweden shows that since the autumn  household’s economic expectations have become more optimistic. The development of monetary aggregates such as M0 is also an indication of rising private consumption. On the other hand  the lower than expected savings ratio in 1996 may increase uncertainty regarding possible increases of private consumption in 1997 and 1998. Another indicator of a slower increase in private consumption could be the weak labour market. In summary it can be said that  on the one hand  exports seem to be doing somewhat better than expected  though the differences are not all that great. On the other hand  the signals about private consumption point either to agreement with the main scenario or to a somewhat weaker course. The conclusion in the latest inflation report was that monetary policy is well balanced. That conclusion still holds true. BIS Review 47/1997

I expressed my views concerning the main functions of a central bank in my speech to last year’s General Assembly. Today I would like to summarize the past year’s operations and share with you my thoughts on the philosophy of central banking. You will find detailed assessments of economic developments in Turkey and abroad in the Bank’s Annual Report for 1996  which has already been distributed to you. Instead of repeating these details  I will describe the implications of the events of 1996 for the operations of the Central Bank. The most important circumstance affecting the economy last year was the long-lasting period of political uncertainty. After the general elections  it took the first six months of the year to put together a coalition government. Political instability  Turkey’s entry into the Customs Union  and lack of the political determination needed to fight inflation created uncertainty in the financial markets. The Central Bank responded by aiming its monetary policies at achieving and protecting stability in the financial markets instead of aiming them at decreasing the rate of inflation. While withholding announcement of its targets for the second half of 1996  the Central Bank implemented a monetary program in keeping with its inner discipline. The main points of monetary policy under this program were as follows: The Central Bank set a ceiling on increases in net domestic assets. The Central Bank paid close attention to keeping increases in reserve money in line with increases in demand. Open market operations were actively used during the year to mop up excess liquidity created by the increases in our net foreign assets. The Central Bank monitored exchange rates throughout the year  with special attention to maintaining stability in the foreign exchange market. Continuous domestic borrowing by the Treasury made a positive contribution to achieving all targets. Turkish lira interests rates were determined mainly by the borrowing strategy of the Treasury. The Turkish Central Bank has played no direct role in the determination of interest rates. In an economy with market-determined interest and exchange rates  where a persistent public deficit is being financed mainly through the domestic markets  the monetary policy tools available to the central bank are few and of limited effectiveness. As noted above  interest rates are determined primarily by the borrowing activities of the Treasury. By the same token  foreign exchange rates are determined as a function of the external trade deficit (itself a function of growth) and the level of interest rates. Under these conditions  the central bank is absolutely obliged to keep the items on its balance sheet under careful control. BIS Review 47/1997 - 2 - I would like to point out that efforts since the second half of 1980 to keep the central bank’s balance sheet healthy have greatly streamlined control over the items on that balance sheet. In 1998  the evaluation account held 45 percent of the assets of analytical balance sheet. In 1996  when it showed a negative balance for the first time  the evaluation account’s share in the assets of the balance sheet fell to zero. Similarly  foreign assets accounted for 30 percent of total assets in 1988  compared to 76 percent in the balance sheet for 1996. In short  the principal source of the increase in central bank assets shifted from increased domestic assets to increased foreign assets  mainly borrowed. The Central Bank considers controlling the increase in domestic assets to be the most important aspect of its monetary program. Only by controlling the increase in domestic assets can we keep the increase in Turkish lira liabilities in line with increasing demand. The 1994 law requiring the Central Bank to gradually phase out its advances of short-term credit to the Treasury  formerly the main source of domestic assets  has been of great assistance in curbing their increase. The continued lowering of this ceiling in coming years will certainly make it much easier for the Central Bank to implement its monetary policy. It is my wish that in the near future  the Turkish Central Bank will see this practice abolished altogether  as it has been in other modern central banks. The elimination of Central Bank credit to the public sector will go far to create the confidence needed to launch the crucial struggle with inflation. Central banks are responsible for keeping prices stable as well as for ensuring that the financial system runs smoothly. A stabilized financial system and stable prices are essential conditions for steady economic growth in the medium term because only a stable financial system can provide the necessary link between savings and investments. Price stability is needed to reduce uncertainties for investors and encourage investments. In the long run  stabilizing prices is likely to increase both living standards and productivity. For this reason  the price stability that is the main goal of central banks is valid and urgent not only in the short run  but also in the long run. And once countries like ours have achieved price stability after long effort  they must continue the effort to maintain it. For central banks  price stability is a permanent goal. Inflation inflicts several burdens on a society: · Overall  it introduces uncertainty into economic decisions and profit seeking. It reduces the discipline of price and market systems. It has negative effects on the cost of capital. It directs resources to unproductive activities. In periods of high inflation  investments in real estate and financial investments become more desirable. · Growth declines as inflation rises. In countries with high inflation  it has been observed that most resources are directed to the financial system. It is also known that the financial system undergoes a relative expansion during such periods. Resources which have accumulated in the financial system cannot be rechannelled by the financial system to more productive sectors. BIS Review 47/1997 - 3 - A stable financial system and stable prices therefore represent the normal environment that central banks are committed to pursue and maintain. A central bank that stabilizes prices increases its credibility. A central bank that protects the value of the currency also helps increase the credibility of the country. The success of the monetary policy implemented to stabilize prices depends on whether or not the financial system is stable. And the price stability and financial system stability that are the primary responsibilities of the central bank are necessary for achieving economic growth in the medium term. Let me mention some qualities that a central bank should have: It should have continuity. Central banks should not be diverted from their permanent goal of price stability by short-term political pressures. It should be competent. A central bank should be completely professional. It should be technically dedicated in its structure  thorough and clear in its expression  and transparent in its actions. It should be a responsible institution. In other words  it should be an institution that is reliable and able to justify its monetary manoeuvres. These are the characteristics of a modern central bank. Central banks that have these qualities will unquestionably occupy a distinguished place in the international environment of the 21st century. I am sure that its long experience  accumulated knowledge and proficient staff make the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey an institution that can fulfil these expectations. I am proud of this institution. I owe a great debt of gratitude to my colleagues  who have greatly contributed to our accomplishments and to our policy implementation. BIS Review 47/1997

Stals  at the official opening of the new Head Office Building for Mercantile Bank in Sandton on 9/4/97.,Mr. Stals discusses financial sector reforms and their implications for the banking industry in South Africa Address by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank  Dr. C. Stals  at the official opening of the new Head Office Building for Mercantile Bank in Sandton on 9/4/97. 1. The need for financial sector reforms In many countries in the world there is at this stage a need for major reforms of the financial sector  which invariably holds important changes for the banking industry. Looking around the world  at least three reasons can be found for financial restructuring. Firstly  there are the countries of Central and Eastern Europe where major transitions are taking place in the economies of the former centrally-planned countries of the now defunct Communist world. The transition from socialist to market-oriented economies requires in most of these countries a major reform of the functions and of the role of the central bank  the introduction of private sector banking institutions driven by the profit motive  the development of financial markets  and the acceptance of macroeconomic monetary policies that played no role in the previously centrally-planned systems. In these countries  it was necessary to introduce certain basic minimum requirements first  such as a recognised system of business laws including corporate  bankruptcy  contract  consumer protection and private property laws that can be consistently enforced and will provide a mechanism for fair resolution of disputes. In most of these countries until a few years ago there did not exist well-defined accounting principles and rules  and independent auditors were not available to certify financial statements and accounts of banking institutions. In summary  the public infrastructure for the management and running of modern banking activity did not exist and had to be established before modern financial market systems could be developed. Secondly  a number of developing countries  particularly from the African continent  have recently embarked on major macroeconomic restructuring programmes  in many cases in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. In a recent publication of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa the need for the reform of the financial sectors of African economies was described as follows: “Financial systems in Africa are characterized by the low level of financial intermediation which takes place in the formal sector  the distressed nature of financial institutions  the high risk profile of financial asset portfolios due to the concentration of numerous countries’ economies in only a few commodities and industrial sectors and the vulnerability of financial asset portfolios to price and supply shocks. In addition  very few formal financial institutions have shown the capacity or willingness to provide financial services to the small-scale entrepreneur and the rural operators. “Furthermore  the range of financial institutions and instruments is narrow. Public ownership of financial institutions is pervasive. Institutions are plagued by a large proportion of non-performing loans in their portfolios. Management lacks the relevant management skills. Financial market depth and breadth is still very limited.” BIS Review 47/1997 - 2 - Reforms in these developing countries have focused on improving the legal  regulatory  supervisory and judiciary environment  reducing financial repression  restoring bank soundness  rehabilitating financial infrastructure  and have included programmes designed to downsize publicly-owned banks  privatising them where possible and encouraging new entrants. Thirdly  reference can be made to financial sector reforms in the emerging economies of the world. In these countries some stage of advancement has already been reached in the development of financial systems. However  new demands are now being made in light of a new global financial environment  characterised by a liberalisation of financial markets  an integration of major global markets and an exposure of individual countries to relatively large international capital movements. In these countries  exchange controls have been or are being removed  multinational financial institutions  including banks  are granted unrestricted entry  and international rules for financial regulation and supervision are being introduced that must be complied with to the satisfaction of international investors. Domestic monetary policy objectives must be brought to terms with the requirements of international market operators  and governments must accept some eroding of their sovereign autonomy for the management of the national economy. 2. Financial sector reforms in South Africa South Africa is part of the latter group of countries. Together with the major social and political reforms of the past few years  we also had to contend with some important restructuring of the financial system. Firstly  the South African financial sector  not unlike other countries on the African continent  had to adapt to the changes in the socio-political environment. Provision was made in the banking legislation for the existence and continuation of numerous informal savings clubs (“stokvels”) operating outside the normal constraints of bank regulation and supervision  but also then  of course  without access to central bank accommodation at the discount window. New legislation to provide for communal ownership of a banking institution was introduced in the form of the Mutual Banks Act. South African banking institutions also adopted their own internal policies to provide for greater participation in the social upliftment programmes of the country. Secondly  bank regulation and supervision underwent major changes over the past ten years to apply the world-wide supported directives of the Basle Committee. At this stage  bank regulation and supervision is based primarily on risk identification and management  with clearly defined roles for shareholders  boards of directors  senior management and internal and external auditors. Thirdly the South African banking scene was opened up for foreign banks. South African banks  in turn  were allowed to establish branch offices  subsidiaries and representative offices in many countries around the world. Fourthly  major changes were introduced in the operations of the financial markets. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange led the way with a major restructuring last year to provide for electronic screen trading  corporate and non-resident participation  and provision for negotiated commissions and principal versus broking trade by members of the Exchange. BIS Review 47/1997 - 3 - Fifthly  with the gradual removal of exchange controls  the South African market in foreign exchange became more competitive and volumes increased to an average of more than $6 billion per day. Sixthly  with South Africa’s active participation in the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  the way has been opened up for South African banks to play an enhanced role in the Southern African region. The process of financial sector reform in South Africa is continuing. Exchange controls have only been removed partly  and South African banks are only gradually adapting themselves to the environment of greater freedom in their international financial operations. Further important changes will be introduced in the structure of the domestic capital market  particularly in so far as the primary issues of government bonds are concerned  and also in the secondary market-making activities of the Reserve Bank. A major revision of the national payment  clearing and settlement system is now under way to provide for real-time on-line settlement on a gross basis of large transactions  and a daily netting and settlement of small transactions in the money market. 3. Implications for the banking sector These financial reforms have important implications for the South African banking sector. Not only did the liberalisation of the markets bring greater competition for the traditional domestic South African banks  but they were also more exposed to the vicissitudes of volatile international capital movements. Our banks were forced to adopt a more open and global attitude in the daily management of their activities. Not only the policies of the South African monetary authorities  but also developments in  for example  the United States of America  the European Union  the Far East  and in other emerging economies of the world  now have a profound effect on the South African money  capital and foreign exchange markets. There are now more than ten foreign banks with formally established branches or subsidiaries in South Africa  and more than 60 international banks with representative offices in the country. These foreign banks provide enhanced competition for the South African banks  particularly in the field of wholesale banking  international trade financing  and in the market for foreign exchange. The liberalisation of the financial market also opened up opportunities for unscrupulous financial operators that are making use of the opportunity to exploit ignorant South Africans with offers of unrealistic yields on deposits  and promises of instant miraculous profits on financial investments. It is amazing that so many South Africans still fall for deceptions such as the ill-fated pyramid schemes that has just recently pushed Albania over the edge of complete social and political collapse. It is even more amazing that the efforts of the Registrar of Banks to protect the South African public against inevitable losses through these exploitations must be defended in courts and in time-consuming litigations. In his efforts to avoid an Albanian situation from developing here  the Registrar is even accused of acting against the Constitution. The changing financial environment also holds important implications for monetary policy in South Africa. The explosion in the volumes of transactions in all the financial markets  the greater participation of all South African residents in financial market operations  the reintegration of South Africa in the world financial system and the liberalisation of financial operations such as foreign exchange transactions  have had an important effect on the amount of bank credit extension and the money supply. These conventional anchors of BIS Review 47/1997 - 4 - monetary policy also increased at unacceptably high rates over the past two years  partly because of structural changes  and partly because of normal pressures of demand increasing at a rate in excess of real income increases. For both the Reserve Bank and the individual banking institution the changing environment brings many challenges. Banks operating in the new environment must be aware of the increased risk exposures that are inevitably associated with an extended process of change. Conventional bank prudency becomes even more important in this situation than under more stable conditions. In many other countries a period of major financial sector reforms ended in major restructuring and rationalisation of the banking sector  often because of unsustainable over-expansion in individual institutions. The Reserve Bank’s concerns about the excessive increases in bank credit extension are not only for the effect it has on the total money supply  but also because of the inherent dangers of a concerted future major default in the servicing of the debt under less favourable macroeconomic conditions. The capacity of borrowers to meet future commitments of interest and debt repayment must not be over-stretched during this period of structural change and rapid expansion in the financial markets. 4. Mercantile Bank and financial sector reforms in South Africa The Mercantile Lisbon Bank Holdings Group has been and continues to be part of the financial sector adjustment process in South Africa. With a substantial shareholding by the Banco National Ultramarino of Portugal  Mercantile is firmly linked to the expanding international participation in South Africa. Furthermore  this association brings to Mercantile Bank the experience of Portugal’s largest commercial bank in its participation in the structural financial adjustment of a country that is preparing itself for the major reforms demanded of prospective participants in the European Union’s integrated financial system and common Euro currency. South Africa obviously has a great interest in these developments now taking place in Europe. Our recent successful negotiations for qualified access to the Lomé Convention provide proof of the importance attached to our future relations with the European Union. The supportive role of Portugal in these negotiations was appreciated. We believe that Portugal will be able to comply with the Maastricht requirements for full participation in the first round of Economic and Monetary Union scheduled for 1 January 1999  and will therefore also continue to carry South Africa’s interests into the European Union. Mercantile Bank has also been part of the domestic South African financial sector reforms in recent years. Since the acquisition in 1994 of Central Registrars  the operations of the two companies were gradually integrated. The changes in the operations of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange last year had a significant impact on Mercantile Registrars  and its contribution to the non-interest income of the Group had increased considerably with the larger volumes traded on the JSE. Finally  Mercantile Bank is also expanding its interests to other African countries  for example Mozambique  and is therefore taking up the challenge of greater financial co- operation in the SADC region. I can only wish you well in your future operations  and may this new building contribute to your future successes  in the interest of the development of a sound and well- managed banking sector in South Africa.

Japan’s economy continues on a recovery trend despite some fluctuations caused by the rise in the consumption tax rate  with private demand showing underlying firmness. Among final demand items  public-sector investment has decreased  and housing investment has declined reflecting the reversal in the stepped-up demand which took place ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate. However  net exports have continued on an increasing trend  and business fixed investment has been rising steadily. Personal consumption is on a moderate recovery trend. Meanwhile  inventories are generally at appropriate levels. In these circumstances  industrial production has been strengthening since autumn 1996. Labor market conditions have been improving moderately on the whole. Prices have stopped declining. Domestic wholesale prices (adjusted for seasonal electricity rates) increased in early April 1997 reflecting the rise in the consumption tax rate. However  the downward pressures remain strong on those such as electrical machinery. Despite these pressures  domestic wholesale prices have remained unchanged or have increased marginally. This reflects the yen’s depreciation and the higher oil prices to date  as well as the moderate improvement in domestic supply and demand conditions. The year-to-year declines in corporate service prices are narrowing  and consumer prices (nationwide  excluding perishables) are marginally above the previous year’s level. With respect to commercial land prices  prices of large and well-located land suited for major developments have stopped declining  while those of land less suited for use have continued to decline. As for residential land  prices have gradually stopped declining. On the balance of payments  the real trade surplus has been on an increasing trend  and the nominal current-account surplus has also increased  albeit very moderately. 2. In the financial markets  the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) rose temporarily around the fiscal year-end  but has since declined to the level slightly below the official discount rate of 0.5 per cent. The 3-month CD rate has continued at around 0.50 - 0.55 per cent except for the fiscal year-end. The long-term government bond yield has been declining since summer 1996  and has recently moved at a low level of 2.1 - 2.2 per cent. Stock prices plummeted between the end of 1996 and the beginning of 1997  and have recently stayed at somewhat over ¥18 000. On the foreign exchange market  the yen has been depreciating against the U.S. dollar since mid-1995  and has recently moved at around ¥125 - 126. Lending by private financial institutions has continued to be lackluster. Growth in monetary aggregates has continued at around 3.0 - 4.0 per cent  but it has declined somewhat compared to summer 1996. 3. Looking at individual components of final demand  public-sector investment is expected to follow a declining trend  although it may be supported for the time being by implementation of the government’s supplementary budget for fiscal 1996. While both exports and imports will expand reflecting the progress in international division of labor  net exports are expected to continue increasing owing partly to the yen’s depreciation since mid- 1995. With respect to the growth of domestic private demand  corporate profits of large manufacturing firms are improving steadily  helped partly by the positive effects on export prices and export volume stimulated by the yen’s depreciation. Recovery in corporate profits has spread to nonmanufacturing firms which are closely related to business activities  as well as BIS Review 47/1997 - 2 - to small manufacturing firms. Business fixed investment is thus expected to increase steadily in months ahead  mainly reflecting 1) this improvement in corporate profits  2) the progress in capital stock adjustments  and 3) the rise in information-related investment. However  the pace of growth in business fixed investment is unlikely to accelerate significantly as balance-sheet adjustment pressures  for one  remain strong. With respect to the household sector  growth in compensation of employees has been accelerating  mainly in bonus payments and overtime payments. Although the negative impact of the rise in the consumption tax rate is yet uncertain  consumer confidence will strengthen if growth continues to spread from the corporate sector to the household sector. Personal consumption will thus continue to recover  despite the reversal in the stepped-up demand that occurred prior to the rise in the consumption tax rate. Meanwhile  any drastic decline in housing investment is unlikely given present low interest rates  albeit with some reversal of the demand that peaked before the rise in the consumption tax rate. 4. Turning to the outlook on prices  there is potential upward pressure on prices reflecting the yen’s depreciation  but they are expected to remain stable for some time. This is because  1) crude oil prices have begun to weaken  2) the recovery in domestic supply and demand conditions has been moderate  and 3) there remains a strong downward pressure on prices owing to technological innovations  particularly in electrical machinery. However  price differentials between home and abroad have narrowed  and the general sense of weak supply and demand conditions for products has receded. Thus  the Bank will monitor more closely future developments in domestic and overseas supply and demand conditions  as well as in the foreign exchange market. 5. In sum  private demand has firmed in a virtuous cycle as growth in production is accompanied by growth in incomes  supported partly by the yen’s depreciation which augmented corporate profits and net exports. Thus  although economic growth will slow down temporarily in the first half of fiscal 1997 with the reversal in the stepped-up demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax  chances are improving that economic recovery turns out to be sustainable. However  the extent of the negative effects caused by the rise in the consumption tax rate  including the reversal in the stepped-up demand  has yet to be confirmed. Also  balance-sheet adjustment pressures may continue to restrain the economic recovery. In these circumstances  promoting effective reforms of Japan’s economic structure is an important ingredient in the efforts to strengthen the basis for recovery in private demand as well as the basis for a medium to long-term growth in Japan’s economy.

I will take this occasion to offer some thoughts related to the upcoming G-7 economic summit meeting  which will be held in Denver in less than two months. One theme in recent summit meetings -- starting in Halifax in 1995 and continuing in Lyon last year -- has been the promotion of stability in international financial markets. My purpose today is not to describe all the efforts that have been made in that regard  which relate primarily to supervision and regulation. Rather  I would like to step back a bit and offer a framework for thinking about those efforts. To begin with  we should not lose sight of the fact that government regulation  if not carefully designed  can undermine the effectiveness of private market regulation and can itself be ineffective in protecting the public interest. No market is ever truly unregulated in that the self-interest of participants generates private market regulation. Counterparties thoroughly scrutinize each other  often requiring collateral and special legal protections; self-regulated clearing houses and exchanges set margins and capital requirements to protect the interests of the members. Thus  the real question is not whether a market should be regulated. Rather  it is whether government intervention strengthens or weakens private regulation  and at what cost. At worst  the introduction of government rules may actually weaken the effectiveness of regulation if government regulation is itself ineffective or  more importantly  undermines incentives for private market regulation. Regulation by government unavoidably involves some element of perverse incentives  that is  moral hazard. If private market participants believe that government is protecting their interests  their own efforts to do so will diminish. At the same time  societies have judged that it is not sufficient to rely exclusively on the private sector to ensure the adequacy of the management of risk in our financial systems. There is a perceived need for supervision and regulation by the public sector  as well. As I will point out shortly  this need arises largely to counter the potential moral hazard that arises as a consequence of the development of large safety nets for our financial systems. Many of the benefits banks provide modern societies derive from their willingness to take risks and from their use of a relatively high degree of financial leverage. Through leverage  in the form principally of taking deposits  banks perform a critical role in the financial intermediation process; they provide savers with additional investment choices and borrowers with a greater range of sources of credit  thereby facilitating a more efficient allocation of resources and contributing importantly to greater economic growth. Indeed  it has been the evident value of intermediation and leverage that has shaped the development of our financial systems from the earliest times -- certainly since Renaissance goldsmiths discovered that lending out deposited gold was feasible and profitable. Central bank provision of mechanisms for converting highly illiquid portfolios into liquid ones in extraordinary circumstances -- a key element of our safety nets -- has led to a greater degree of leverage in banking than market forces alone would support. Traditionally these mechanisms involve making discount or Lombard facilities available  so that individual depositories could turn illiquid assets into liquid resources and not exacerbate unsettled market conditions by the forced selling of such assets or the calling of loans. More broadly  open market operations  in situations like that which followed the crash of stock markets around the world in BIS Review 46/1997 - 2 - 1987  satisfy increased needs for liquidity for the system as a whole that otherwise could feed cumulative  self-reinforcing contractions across many financial markets. Of course  this same leverage and risk-taking also greatly increase the possibility of bank failures. Without leverage  losses from risk-taking would be absorbed by a bank’s owners  virtually eliminating the chance that the bank would be unable to meet its obligations in the case of a “failure.” Some failures can be of a bank’s own making  resulting  for example  from poor credit judgments. For the most part  these failures are a normal and important part of the market process and provide discipline and information to other participants regarding the level of business risks. However  because of the important roles that banks and other financial intermediaries play in our financial systems  such failures could have large ripple effects that spread throughout business and financial markets at great cost. The presence of the safety net  which inevitably imparts a subsidy to banks  has created a disconnect between risk-taking by banks and banks’ cost of capital. It is this disconnect that has made necessary a degree of supervision and regulation that would not be necessary without the existence of the safety net. That is  regulators are compelled to act as a surrogate for market discipline since the market signals that usually accompany excessive risk-taking are substantially muted  and because the prices to banks of government deposit guarantees  or of access to the safety net more generally  do not  and probably cannot  vary sufficiently with risk to mimic market prices. The problems that arise from the retarding of the pressures of market discipline have led us increasingly to accept supervision and regulation that endeavors to simulate the market responses that would occur if there were no safety net  but without giving up its protections. To be sure  we should recognize that if we choose to have the advantages of a safety net and a leveraged system of financial intermediaries  the burden of managing risk in the financial system will not lie with the private sector alone. With leveraging there will always exist a remote possibility of a chain reaction  a cascading sequence of defaults that will culminate in financial implosion if it proceeds unchecked. Only a modern central bank  with its unlimited power to create money  can with a high probability thwart such a process before it becomes destructive. Hence  central banks will of necessity be drawn into becoming lenders of last resort. But implicit in the existence of such a role is that there will be some form of allocation between the public and private sectors of the burden of risk of extreme outcomes. Thus  central banks are led to provide what essentially amounts to catastrophic financial insurance coverage. Such a public subsidy should be reserved for only the rarest of disasters. If the owners or managers of private financial institutions were to anticipate being propped up frequently by government support  it would only encourage reckless and irresponsible practices. In theory  the allocation of responsibility for risk-bearing between the private sector and the central bank depends upon an evaluation of the private cost of capital. In order to attract  or at least retain  capital  a private financial institution must earn at minimum the overall economy’s rate of return  adjusted for risk. In competitive financial markets  the greater the leverage  the higher the rate of return  before adjustment for risk. If private financial institutions have to absorb all financial risk  then the degree to which they can leverage will be limited  the financial sector smaller  and its contribution to the economy more limited. On the other hand  if central banks effectively insulate private institutions from the largest potential losses  however incurred  increased laxity could threaten a major drain on taxpayers or produce inflationary instability as a consequence of excess money creation. BIS Review 46/1997 - 3 - Thus  governments  including central banks  have been given certain responsibilities related to their banking and financial systems that must be balanced. We have the responsibility to prevent major financial market disruptions through development and enforcement of prudent regulatory standards and  if necessary in rare circumstances  through direct intervention in market events. But we also have the responsibility to ensure that private sector institutions have the capacity to take prudent and appropriate risks. Our goal as supervisors should not be to prevent all bank failures  but to maintain sufficient prudential standards so that banking problems that do occur do not become widespread. We try to achieve the proper balance through official regulations  as well as through formal and informal supervisory policies and procedures. The revolution in information and data processing technology has transformed our financial markets and the way our financial institutions conduct their operations. In most respects  these technological advances have enhanced the potential for reducing transactions costs  to the benefit of consumers of financial services  and for managing risks. But in some respects they have increased the potential for more rapid and widespread disruption. The efficiency of global financial markets  engendered by the rapid proliferation of financial products  has the capability of transmitting mistakes at a far faster pace throughout the financial system in ways that were unknown a generation ago  and not even remotely imagined in the 19th century. Financial crises in the early 19th century  for example  particularly those associated with the Napoleonic Wars  were often related to military and other events in faraway places. Communication was still comparatively primitive. An investor’s speculative position could be wiped out by a military setback  and he might not even know about it for days or even weeks  which  from the perspective of central banking today  might be considered bliss. Similarly  the collapse of Barings Brothers in 1995 showed how much more rapidly losses can be generated in the current environment relative to a century earlier when Barings Brothers confronted a similar episode. Current technology enables single individuals to initiate massive transactions with very rapid execution. Clearly  not only has the productivity of global finance increased markedly  but so  obviously  has the ability to generate losses at a previously inconceivable rate. These technological forces also have been central to the process of globalization  that is  the growing integration of national economies -- including national financial markets. They are  of course  not the only forces. The gradual removal of barriers to trade  deregulation and reform of financial systems  and simply the enormous creation of wealth have all generated the demand and opportunities for the expansion of investment and business horizons beyond national boundaries. Technological changes have facilitated such an expansion. The growing importance of emerging market economies in international financial markets is one manifestation not just of the impressive growth of those economies but also of increasing global integration. Thus  it is not surprising that the need to promote financial stability  and in particular to enhance prudential supervision  in emerging market economies was identified at the Lyon summit as an important objective. It is important for those economies individually and for all of us collectively. One element of the follow-up to the Lyon summit that is especially fitting in the context of my earlier remarks has been efforts to enhance market transparency  including more - - and more meaningful -- public disclosure. Meaningful public disclosures by firms about the BIS Review 46/1997 - 4 - nature of their risk exposures and their procedures for managing those risks contribute significantly to the constructive role of market discipline. Not surprisingly  the market itself is probably the most powerful source of pressure for improved disclosures. I might mention one specific accomplishment related to market transparency. Central banks have agreed to establish a system of regular reporting of derivatives activities by the world’s major dealers  beginning as of June 1998. The system has been designed to yield aggregate data on global trading activities in a manner that avoids double counting and is sensitive to reporting burden. The aggregate data will be publicly released to enable firms to assess their own activities in relation to the market as a whole. The globalization of international financial markets and of the operations of individual firms clearly calls for international cooperation among supervisors. Correspondingly  supervisory cooperation is an important element of the G-7 summit agenda on financial stability. Much of the recent work has related to the desirability of a more systematic exchange of information among national supervisors  including consideration of what kinds of information need to be exchanged and under what circumstances. The possible need for and possible roles of an “information coordinator” have been central issues in the Joint Forum discussions. The objective of a more systematic exchange of information is easy to support in principle. However  when it comes to implementation  there are questions that need to be addressed. Even more questions arise when one thinks of going beyond the exchange of information to other forms of supervisory coordination  involving a “lead regulator” of some kind that is intended to fill so-called supervisory gaps. What are the supervisory gaps that need to be filled? Each of us could probably point to episodes where problems could have been avoided  or the degree of disruption could have been reduced  if better information had been available sooner to supervisory authorities. Perhaps Barings is one example. It is more difficult to point to episodes when the absence of formal arrangements for coordination of supervisory actions inhibited a response to a problem. Conversely  might arrangements that are too formal  too rigid  or too cumbersome themselves inhibit appropriate responses in emergency situations  each of which is likely to be unique? Another question is whether supervisory authorities have the expertise and resources to provide meaningful oversight and develop accurate assessments of the risk-taking activities of large  diversified  globally active financial institutions. If the answer is no  as might well be the case  should we nevertheless convey to market participants the sense that we are in fact adequately supervising such activities? Wouldn’t that reduce the incentives for market participants themselves to provide discipline? Would a statement that all major financial firms  even the most diversified ones  are subject to coordinated supervision suggest a degree of support that effectively extends  to an unwarranted extent  the subsidy associated with national safety nets? Would it generate a degree of moral hazard that could itself be the source of systemic risk? The answers to these questions are not straightforward. However  while many firms should reassess and upgrade their risk management procedures  and supervisors should improve their procedures as well  I do not believe that the need for a radical change in our framework for the supervision of internationally active financial firms has been demonstrated. The paradigm of supervision itself is  of necessity  continuously adjusted to the rapidly changing  technologically driven financial system. In recent years  firms and supervisors alike BIS Review 46/1997 - 5 - have sought to harness technological advances to enhance risk management procedures. Much thought has been given to how to make public disclosure more meaningful and to reinforce market discipline. Supervisors around the world  not just in the major industrial countries  have gotten to know each other better and to understand better each others’ problems and policies. The legal and institutional infrastructure of financial markets has been significantly improved. Along with good macroeconomic policy -- a topic for another day -- a continuation of this ongoing process of careful and measured progress represents the most constructive strategy for ensuring financial stability.

Duisenberg  at the Spring Meeting of the Institute of International Finance in Washington on 29/4/97. 1. Only twenty months to go before EMU takes off; before then  in the summer of 1998 at the latest  the ESCB will be established. The preparations for this turning-point in the history of Europe are in full swing. Next year it will be decided which Member States are to be in from the outset  a decision to be taken as you know by the Heads of Government on the basis of the measure of sustained convergence achieved. Although the stability-oriented tradition which has grown up over the years is to be continued within EMU  there will be a fundamental change in the way monetary policy will be determined centrally. Here questions arise  such as: how will the centre  i.e. the ECB  and the existing national central banks relate to each other in such a context  and how can the skills and expertise of those national central banks best be used  without impairing the single nature of monetary policy? It is these questions that I would like to focus on today. As the ESCB will have a federal structure comparable to that of the Federal Reserve System  it may be useful to take a look at the experience of the United States  all the more so as the underlying economies will be comparable in size. In particular  what lessons can Europe learn from this experience? 2. Let me emphasize a few points at the outset. On its own  monetary policy is not equipped to counter an unfavourable macro-economic development. That calls for the concerted employment of all available macro-economic policy instruments. In the American situation  the Fed is expected to operate within the framework of the general economic objectives set by the Administration. Coordination is facilitated by the centralized formulation of monetary policy. In a monetary union such as the United States and the future EMU  policy can only be pursued centrally. It is indivisible by its very nature  for one thing because of its official interest rates  subjecting all regions making up the union to uniform financial conditions. As to the question how monetary policy can best be conducted  there is no unequivocal answer. That question relates to issues such as the economic variables on which policy should focus  or in other words  the choice of intermediate objective. In some countries  Germany among them  policy is targeted at a monetary aggregate  while in others a strategy of direct inflation targeting is pursued. Alternatively  monetary authorities may focus on a range of economic indicators  as is done in the United States. I will not go into the pros and cons of these methods here today. In the European context  the EMI has concluded that in practice the differences between the various policy strategies that could be pursued by the ESCB are not as large as in theory. A decision is to be taken by the ECB on this point next year. 3. Looking at the structure of the Fed  we see three components  specifically the Board of Governors  the regional reserve banks and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC issues a periodic guideline for monetary policy  while the Board serves as the executive body. It is empowered to adjust policy  within the mandate provided by the FOMC  when necessary in the period between FOMC meetings. Thanks to a rotation system  the reserve banks are involved in FOMC decision-making on an alternating basis. The American legislature obviously meant the Fed to have a decentralized structure  in which the regional reserve banks can each have their say. The aim was to prevent Fed policy-makers from catering unduly to the wishes of either the financial centre  i.e. New York  or the political hub  i.e. Washington. In spite of the decentralized nature of the Federal Reserve System  however  a certain specialization tendency has increasingly developed over the years  due in part to technological innovations and market developments. Take  for instance  the operations ensuing BIS Review 46/1997 - 2 - from the Fed’s monetary tasks  such as money and foreign exchange market interventions. These are effected in their entirety in New York. In other areas  too  such as the payments system  the reserve banks have developed their own specializations. 4. In determining monetary policy  the Fed relies on regional input. The reserve banks contribute to policy through their role in the discussions and the number of votes they can cast (five out of a total of twelve) at FOMC meetings. At these meetings no fixed policy proposals are presented in advance  the aim being an open discussion where the various parties reach agreement through mutual persuasion. Any decision should  after all  be endorsed by as many parties as possible. Obviously  in this American context  the chairman must be someone of considerable stature. I believe that involving the reserve banks in policy-making and in the efforts to expound that policy to the folks back home is the right way to go about things  reinforcing as it does the cohesion within the system. 5. In short  the Fed operates what is in my view a well-balanced model of monetary decision-making. Though policy is conducted centrally  the various interests of the separate regions are not overlooked. The System is furthermore capable of reacting adroitly  as evidenced by the United States’ long-term record of strong economic growth and modest inflation. 6. How does everything I have just said translate to the future situation in Europe? As in the United States  policy in Europe will be determined centrally and implemented  where possible and appropriate  decentrally. In Europe  too  an institutional division into three components will be instituted. Specifically  the ESCB will be made up of three elements  the ECB Executive Board  responsible for day-to-day policy  the ESCB Council  made up of this Board and the governors of the national central banks  and the national central banks themselves. There are considerable similarities between this structure and that of the Fed  made up of the Board of Governors  the FOMC and the reserve banks. Yet the emphasis will  on some issues  be placed differently. 7. One difference concerns voting arrangements within the ESCB Council  which are not the same as those within the FOMC. In the ESCB Council the votes of the national central banks  represented by their governors  will predominate over those of the Executive Board. In the FOMC  it is the votes of the centre  i.e. the Board of Governors  which represent the majority. This means that if effective decisions are to be arrived at in Europe  the national central bank governors will have to be like-minded; in other words  policy-makers will have to abandon their purely national outlooks  exchanging them for a “European perspective”. The experience of the FOMC shows that is can be achieved. The ESCB will have the important task of helping to foster such a European perspective  with the centre taking the initiative. The European outlook will furthermore have to be disseminated among the general public. An ESCB making an effort to explain and seek understanding for its policy decisions will generate support for its actions. This is a task for the national central banks  whose historical ties to their own peoples are deeply rooted. In this respect it should also be kept in mind that the Fed’s accountability to Congress has no equivalent in Europe. Although the President of the ESCB is expected to appear periodically before the European Parliament  the latter does not have the same powers as the US Congress  which can in principle amend the Federal Reserve Act. Furthermore  any discussion of the European policy mix will be different in nature because budgetary policy will remain the province of the European Member States. This policy will  however  be subject to the limitations set out in the Stability Pact recently agreed by the Member States  which as you know aims to foster sustained sound public finances in Europe. BIS Review 46/1997 - 3 - 8. What I have just said about the need to develop a “European” perspective has implications for monetary and economic analysis. The centre will need to have at its disposal considerable analytical machinery in order to be able to perform this pioneering role successfully. As a system of European statistics and analysis cannot be set up overnight  no time should be lost. Indeed  the preparations being made at the EMI in this area are proceeding at full steam. Of course  these new statistics will take getting used to. But  at the same time  some things will remain unchanged. National analyses will continue to play an important role so long as Europe has not been transformed into a single economy. After all  if we wish to understand what is happening at the European level  we would be well advised also to look at the underlying national economic relationships. With respect to these analytical tasks  the division of labour between the centre and the national central banks is likely to evolve of its own accord. At first glance  this division seems likely to reflect that the national central banks know their own economies best. 9. Contrary to the US situation  the implementation of monetary policy in Europe will not take place at one location away from the centre but  where possible and appropriate  decentrally. That has to do with the fact that Europe’s central banks and financial markets have a rich and extensive history. A decentral approach makes allowance for differences in European practices and market conditions. In this context it should be noted that the formulation chosen for decentralization in Europe in principle allows for the ECB to play a role in policy implementation. There is no knowing in advance how the tasks will be divided among the national central banks themselves  and between them and the centre in the more distant future. The American example shows us that such matters cannot be laid down in a blueprint for eternity. Decentralization is a sound principle to cater to initial national differences in the financial markets  but it must not stand in the way of further integration. In other words  policy must accommodate the disappearance of national financial market characteristics and the emergence of a single integrationa European money and capital market. 10. EMU will remain a union of different countries. This means  among other things  that the differences prevailing among the various central banks regarding their non-monetary tasks can  in principle  continue to exist. I am referring here  for instance  to banking supervision  surveillance of payment systems  and the fiscal agent function for the benefit of the Government. It is interesting to see that in the United States  where such matters have been organized in a uniform manner  some degree of specialization has emerged among the regional reserve banks. Owing to the continuing existence of national responsibilities and practices  this extent of specialization will not be feasible in Europe. 11. I have arrived at the conclusion of my address. Like the Federal Reserve System  the ESCB will be characterized by central and decentral elements. However  the mix will not be the same  due to differences in the starting position  as well as in social and political conditions. Yet the experience of the Federal Reserve System offers instructive insights. It highlights the importance of “homogenous” thinking within the system  and of focusing on the European perspective  without disregarding regional developments. It will be a challenge for us in Europe to ensure that a similar balance is achieved within the ESCB. BIS Review 46/1997

The objective of monetary policy There is fairly general consensus in the world of central banking today that the objective of monetary policy should be to protect the value of the currency. There was a time up to the late ’seventies when economists and central bankers advocated a much wider role for monetary policy in the management of the macroeconomy. Under the influence of the Keynesian demand management approach  monetary policy was seen as a useful instrument to be used by the authorities to depress demand in times of an excessive rise in total real expenditure on goods and services  or to stimulate real demand in times of recessionary conditions. Monetary policy may have been an effective instrument for the purpose of demand management in the global system of fixed par values  or in the times of Keynes’ General Theory of Employment  Interest and Money  (1936)  when a lack of overall demand caused production resources to remain under-utilised. During the 1970’s  however  the Bretton Woods System of fixed par values was replaced with the global system of floating exchange rates and over-stimulation with expansionary monetary and fiscal policies created inflationary pressures and persistent balance of payments crisis situations. The emphasis in macroeconomic policy gradually shifted from demand-side management to supply-side expansion in which monetary policy was assigned a different role. Monetary policy was no longer accepted as a useful short-term anti-cyclical policy instrument  but was tasked with the responsibility of creating on a continuous basis a financial environment that will be conducive to sustainable optimum economic growth in the longer term. This environment can be characterised by stable overall financial conditions in which the rate of inflation will at all times be low. In this new approach  central banks focused their attention on major financial developments such as changes in the money supply and in bank credit extension  the level and the structure of interest rates  changes in the official foreign reserves of the country  and movements in the exchange rate. The ultimate objective of monetary policy became the value of the currency  and whatever strategies were followed with the implementation of monetary policy  the success or failure of the policy was measured by the level of inflation. The major industrial countries were extremely successful with this new approach  and during the eighties most major economies succeeded in reducing inflation to relatively low levels  that is  in general to about 1 to 2 per cent per annum. This left but little choice for the smaller economies of the world to follow suit  particularly as the drive towards global financial integration gained more momentum during the ninety- nineties. The odd old-time economist who believes that contemporary monetary policy is on a wrong track  particularly in the developing economies  still surfaces from time to time. The counter-argument is often based on the so-called Phillips Curve or an assumed trade-off that is perceived to exist between inflation and economic growth. There is sufficient evidence to confirm  however  that in the longer term  maximum economic growth is invariably attained at the lowest possible rate of inflation. The development of the theory of rational expectations questions the validity of the existence of a Phillips Curve trade-off  even in the short term. BIS Review 49/1997 - 2 - Be that as it may  a country such as South Africa with its open economy can hardly maintain overall financial stability unless its rate of inflation stays more or less in line with the average rate of inflation in the economies of its major international trading partners and competitors. 2. The South African experience On recommendation of the De Kock Commission of Inquiry into the Monetary System and Monetary Policy in South Africa  the South African Reserve Bank adopted money supply targets as the anchor for its monetary policy model in 1986. After the money supply increased by 27 per cent in 1988  and the rate of inflation at one stage rose over 20 per cent  the new monetary policy model of the Reserve Bank was implemented with more vigour  and the rate of increase in the money supply was gradually reduced to below 10 per cent in 1992. For two years in succession  the M3 money supply rose by about 8 per cent. Almost as if by magic  the rate of inflation also declined to below 10 per cent in 1993  and stayed in single- digits for the next four years. In 1996  the average rate of inflation was only 7.4 per cent  the lowest level for any calendar year since 1972. The Reserve Bank seems to have lost some of its tight grip over the money supply over the past three years  when the rate of increase in M3 accelerated to a level of about 15 per cent during each of the years 1994  1995 and 1996. These were  however  extremely difficult years with major political and social reforms and the gradual reintegration of South Africa in the global economy. The liberalisation of the foreign exchange market in South Africa  the access of more than fifty foreign banks to the South African financial market  and the easier access of South African banks to foreign sources of liquidity  brought major changes to the pattern of financial flows and banking activities. The consequences of these changes for monetary policy must still be digested and analysed in more detail  and some adjustments to the monetary policy model applied by the Reserve Bank may be necessary. Initially  the acceleration in the rate of increase in the money supply had little effect on inflation. The rate of inflation indeed continued to decline to reach a lower turning point of 5.5 per cent over the twelve months up to April 1996. A sharp depreciation in the exchange rate of the rand after February 1996 provided a new shock stimulus for inflation in South Africa and  assisted by a continuous excessive rate of increase in the money supply  the rate of increase in overall consumer prices accelerated to 9.8 per cent over the twelve months up to February 1997. The Reserve Bank is greatly concerned about these latest trends in the rate of increase in the money supply  the rate of increase in bank credit extension  and in the rate of inflation. It is accepted that the depreciation of the rand last year must inevitably lead to some price rises  but there is a real danger that these price adjustments (of internationally tradable versus non-tradable goods and services) will become embedded in a permanently higher rate of inflation. 3. The monetary policy model The South African experience with the “monetarist” approach applied since 1986 was relatively successful. The present threat of a new surge in inflation should not be seen as a failure of the policy approach  but rather as a result of an external shock -- the currency depreciation -- and a severe testing of the monetary policy model in light of the changing macroeconomic environment. Central bankers may concur in general on the main objective of monetary policy  namely to protect the value of the currency  but they do not all follow the same strategy in pursuing BIS Review 49/1997 - 3 - this objective. The South African model  which is also used by many other countries  is primarily linked to the growth in the M3 money supply  and predetermined guidelines for an acceptable rate of growth in M3 should be seen as an intermediate objective of monetary policy. It is based on the assumption that  over time  there is a link between the rate of expansion in the money supply and inflation. If the real economy  for example  expands by 3 per cent per annum  and the current rate of inflation is 7 per cent  a continuous increase in the nominal money supply at rates of more than 10 per cent per annum will eventually exert upward pressure on inflation. Increases in the money supply of less than 10 per cent will drag inflation downwards. Over the past few years  the Reserve Bank had indicated that an appropriate rate of increase for the South African money supply would be between 6 and 10 per cent. The realised rates of increase were  however  around the level of 15 per cent during each of the years 1994  1995 and 1996. Initially  the Bank was less concerned about this excessive rate of increase in the money supply  particularly also in light of the relatively low rates of increase of well below 10 per cent established in 1992 and 1993. Inflation also remained on a downward path up to April 1996. It is only over the past twelve months therefore that inflation started moving up again  triggered by the depreciation of the rand last year. The persistently high rates of increase in M3 were partly caused by structural changes in the South African economy. More people were absorbed in the market economy  earned regular incomes  and opened bank accounts for the first time. More banks were established in South Africa  particularly foreign banks  and offered more banking services to the South African public. South African banks found easier access to foreign sources of credit  and made the conventional Reserve Bank instruments to control overall liquidity in the banking sector less effective. The main reason for the larger than desirable increases in the money supply was concentrated in relatively large increases of almost 20 per cent per annum in the total amount of bank credit extended to the private sector. The monetary policy model based on the control of increases in the money supply  requires some effective control over the amount of bank credit extension  because this is the main source of money creation in the South African market-oriented economy. Control over bank credit extension requires not only a restriction on the amount of liquidity available in the banking sector  but also the acceptance of realistic interest rates. Despite the maintenance of relatively high interest rates in South Africa  and a series of increases in interest rates since November 1995  the demand for bank credit remained relatively strong. This may indicate a less interest-rate sensitive demand for credit in South Africa that may be associated with the socio-political changes over the past few years already referred to above. The Reserve Bank remains concerned about the excessive rates of growth in the money supply  and remains committed to reducing this monetary stimulation of inflation during the course of 1997. Recent trends in the money supply and bank credit extension beg the question  however  whether monetary policy at this juncture is restrictive enough and whether even more stringent measures may not be required to reduce overall liquidity further  which could  of course  lead to even higher interest rates and hopefully also a decline in the demand for credit. 4. Other functions of the central bank Restricting the functions of the central bank to the monetary objective of creating a stable overall financial environment  vests a further important responsibility with the monetary authorities  and that is to encourage and support the development of sound and well-managed banking institutions. Banking institutions replace the central bank as the major supplier of money to the public  and therefore have become important conduits for the implementation of monetary policy. BIS Review 49/1997 - 4 - The South African Reserve Bank has therefore been vested also with the task of bank regulation and supervision. This task is becoming increasingly more difficult as banking institutions become more multi-national  and as cross-border financial operations increase. The Reserve Bank’s Bank Supervision Department works very closely with their counterparts in many other countries to ensure that uniform  compatible and effective prudential directives are complied with by all banks operating in South Africa  and also by the foreign branches and subsidiaries of South African resident banking institutions. The defined objective for monetary policy also requires of the central bank to accept some leading role in the development and administration of an efficient functioning national payments  settlement and clearing system. The Reserve Bank is now working with the other banking institutions to upgrade the South African payments  settlement and clearing system. Provision will soon be made for real-time on-line settlement of large transactions  and for the daily netting and settlement of smaller payment transactions done through the banking system. Efficient monetary policy in a market-oriented economy finally also requires well-functioning financial markets. The Reserve Bank therefore has a vested interest in the development of the money  capital and foreign exchange markets. In the case of the South African foreign exchange market  the Reserve Bank is working closely with the Minister of Finance gradually to phase out exchange controls  and to integrate the South African financial markets with international markets. 5. Conclusion The South African experience ratifies the international experience that monetary policy should primarily be aimed at financial objectives and should at all times be used to promote overall financial stability. This is the best contribution monetary policy can make to the promotion of economic growth and development in the interest of all the people of the country. In pursuing its strictly defined financial objectives  the central bank should have some autonomy from Government and should be enabled to take quick and objective decisions on the implementation of monetary policy. There must  however  always be close co- operation with the Minister of Finance  and monetary and fiscal policy should be closely co-ordinated. In the final situation  the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Reserve Bank are jointly responsible for maintaining overall financial stability in the country. BIS Review 49/1997

I am pleased once again to address this annual meeting of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. Before I begin  I would like to join his colleagues in wishing Bob Richard well. Over the years  it has been a pleasure to work with him. He will be sorely missed. Today  I shall concentrate my remarks on the current debate in Congress and elsewhere on how best to accomplish financial reform. This subject has been a recurring theme in Federal Reserve comments  speeches  and testimonies during the first part of 1997 and  I suspect  the subject will continue to engage us for some months ahead. My remarks today will reemphasize some of the points made at other venues this year  although I will attempt to place these arguments in the context of the impact of financial reform on the state-chartered banks and on the roles such banks  and their regulators  play in maintaining the overall well-being of our banking system and our economy. To begin  there does appear to be general agreement on the need for financial reform. Permitting various financial businesses to be conducted jointly should provide the benefits of increased services and/or lower prices to financial customers  improved risk reduction  and cost savings for financial firms. More broadly  it should improve the efficiency and stability of the financial system that underlies our economy. These benefits are expected to flow primarily from opportunities for diversification  non-interest cost reduction  and cross-marketing for those banks  investment banks  and insurance companies that find ways to profitably merge their businesses in the wake of legislation permitting expanded powers for banking organizations. But the longer financial reform is delayed  the less important and useful it will be. Put in economist’s jargon  the longer the delay the lower the marginal economic benefits produced by reform legislation  and the more we should be concerned instead with possible unintended negative effects that might outweigh those marginal benefits. Let me explain. Financial markets  as we all should know by now  have a way of effectively circumventing uneconomic barriers or bottlenecks created by inefficient legislation or regulation. Today  it has become possible  through the judicious use of derivative instruments  for a financial firm engaged primarily in one kind of financial activity to mimic the risks and returns of any other financial activity. Banking  investment banking  and insurance can no longer be viewed  from a risk-return perspective  as separate and distinct lines of business. To cite just one example  banks are prohibited from underwriting insurance  yet the writing of a put option -- a form of derivative activity engaged in widely by large banks -- is  in economic substance  a form of insurance underwriting. Other derivative markets  including the emerging credit derivative instruments  now permit banks to diversify their credit and market risks as if they had been permitted to merge with investment banks or insurance companies. Thus  some of the long-sought-after economic benefits resulting from the repeal of legislative barriers between and among different “types” of financial firm already have been achieved through the creativity of the marketplace. Nevertheless  by not being able to engage directly in the impermissible activity  a banking company cannot achieve the production or marketing synergies  and therefore the cost reductions  that may flow from joint operations and that may benefit a bank’s shareholders as well as its customers. In addition to the actions of the marketplace  banking regulators have acted  within the constraints of statute  to facilitate economic combinations of banking and nonbanking financial activities. Specifically  the Federal Reserve has adopted both liberalization of Section 20 activities and expedited procedures for processing applications under Regulation Y. The OCC  meanwhile  has BIS Review 49/1997 - 2 - generated some controversy by liberalizing banks’ insurance agency powers as well as procedures generally for establishing operating subsidiaries of national banks that may engage in activities not permitted to the bank. This is not to say that financial reform legislation will have no marginal benefit. Clearly  in addition to the benefit of lowered costs  much remains to be accomplished in the form of improved management efficiency. These benefits  which will accrue both to the banks and the general public  probably can be maximized only within the context of clear legislative authority for combining financial firms of various types. We must be careful  however  in our efforts to achieve the benefits of financial reform  not to violate the tenets of good public policy. In this regard  the Federal Reserve believes that any financial reform should be consistent with four basic objectives: (1) continuing the safety and soundness of the banking system; (2) limiting systemic risk; (3) contributing to macroeconomic stability; and (4) limiting the spread of both the moral hazard and the subsidy implicit in the federal safety net. I have spent a good deal of time of late on the fourth objective. Therefore  today I will concentrate on the first three and how  in particular  financial reform must be careful to preserve the role of the state-chartered bank in meeting our economy’s macroeconomic objectives and our concerns regarding systemic risk. The importance of the state-chartered bank Some erroneously dismiss state-chartered banks as representing only the down-scale end of the banking market and  therefore  being not particularly worthy of careful policy consideration. State-chartered banks indeed are smaller on average than national banks  and are disproportionately represented within the very smallest size class. Nevertheless  state-chartered banks account for about a third of our superregionals  not to mention a few state banks that are among the very largest money center institutions. Even the preponderance of small  state-chartered banks  however  play a critical role within our financial system  for several reasons. First  having large numbers of community-sized banks  be they state-chartered or national banks  is a major contribution to the stability of the banking system and the well-being of the macroeconomy. Just as a more highly diversified loan portfolio reduces risk to the individual bank  a more highly diversified banking structure reduces risk to the banking system as a whole. Indeed  our decentralized and diverse banking structure was arguably the key to weathering the financial crisis of the late 1980s. During those dark days  our system was able to absorb more than a thousand U.S. bank failures. And yet here we are  less than a decade later  with loan loss reserves and bank capital at their highest levels in almost a half century  and the insurance fund restored to its maximum coverage ratio -- all without cost to the taxpayer. Of course  the bank failures of the past decade  combined with the current wave of mergers and acquisitions  have served to reduce significantly the total number of banking organizations in the U.S. But the more than 7 000 separate banking companies that remain are more than sufficient to maintain our highly decentralized and flexible banking structure. Large numbers of small banks go hand in hand with a macroeconomy characterized by large numbers of small  entrepreneurial nonfinancial businesses. Smaller banks traditionally have been a major source of capital for small businesses that may not have access to securities markets. In turn  small businesses account for the major portion of new employment and new ideas  thereby playing a major role in fueling economic growth. This connection running between small banks  small business  and the macroeconomy -- indeed the role of banks generally in funding business expansion -- is so important that we must be sensitive to the tradeoff between risk-taking and bank solvency. Risk-taking -- prudent risk-taking to be sure -- is the primary economic function of banking. All wealth is measured by its perceived ability to produce goods and services of value in the future. Since the future is fundamentally BIS Review 49/1997 - 3 - unknown  endeavoring to create wealth implies an uncertain expectation of how the future will unfold. That is  creating wealth is risky. Hence banking  to further its primary economic purpose of financing the economy  cannot and should not avoid prudent risk-taking. Bank supervisors  in turn  need to recognize that the optimal bank failure rate is not zero. A zero failure rate over time implies either extraordinary insight by bankers  a notion I readily dismiss  or an undue and unhelpful degree of conservatism in banking practice. In taking on risk  of course  some mistakes will be made  and some banks will fail. Even if a bank is well-managed  it can simply become unlucky. Failure should occur  indeed does occur  as part of the natural process within our competitive economy. It should not be viewed as a flaw in our financial system  and certainly we should not attempt to eliminate it. Only when the failure rate threatens to breach a prudent threshold should we become concerned. Just as large numbers of smaller banks are a key to the robustness of our economy  the state charter is a key to the robustness of our banking structure. The dual banking system has fostered a steady stream of banking innovations that have benefited consumers and bank shareholders alike. For example  the NOW account  as I like to point out  was invented at a state-chartered bank; and the NOW account was the opening shot in the campaign to remove national deposit interest rate controls and allow banks to compete on common ground with nonbank institutions such as money funds. The 1994 interstate branching statute likewise has its origin in the state laws that permitted cross-border banking  beginning with the rewriting of the Maine banking laws. Adjustable rate mortgages are another innovation that began at the state level  and of course  the National Banking Act itself has its origin in the states’ “free banking” laws of the nineteenth century. The dual banking system not only fosters and preserves innovation but also constitutes our main protection against overly zealous and rigid federal regulation and supervision. A bank must have a choice of more than one federal regulator  must be permitted to change charters  to protect itself against arbitrary and capricious regulatory behavior. Naturally  some observers are concerned that two or more federal agencies will engage in a “competition in laxity”  and we must guard against that; but the greater danger  I believe  is that a single federal regulator would become rigid and insensitive to the needs of the marketplace. Thus  so long as we have a federal guarantee of deposits  Federal Reserve guarantee of intraday payments over Fedwire  and other elements of the safety net -- and  therefore  so long as there is a need for federal regulation of banks -- such regulation should entail a choice of that regulator at the federal level. As you are well aware  the Federal Reserve has long been a strong supporter of the dual banking system in the context of efficient supervision. That is why we  along with the FDIC  have sought examination partnerships with the state banking regulators. Currently  the Fed has cooperative agreements with about three dozen states  calling for either joint examinations or alternate year exams. Overall  our experience with these programs has been quite positive  in part because of the quality of state supervision in the states with the cooperative agreements. Indeed  the evidence suggests that safety and soundness of state banks compare quite favorably with national banks  possibly reflecting the benefits of having both state and federal supervision. For example  during the banking crisis of the late 1980s  when the failure rate by any measure breached the prudent threshold I mentioned earlier  the national bank failure rate was considerably greater than for state banks. While bank failure is determined by more than just the supervision process  these data nevertheless speak well of the quality of the state supervisory process and the ability of the state and federal regulators to function together efficiently. The dual banking system  however  despite its advantages and achievements  is under attack. This attack is neither particularly intentional nor particularly coordinated  but rather consists of the unintended consequences of statutory and regulatory changes aimed at achieving broader policy objectives. I am referring primarily to the consequences of the 1994 interstate branching BIS Review 49/1997 - 4 - legislation  coupled with the OCC’s recent liberalization of regulatory procedures for operating subsidiaries of national banks. These events may have served to tip the balance in favor of national banks  so to speak  in a manner that weakens banks’ ability to switch federal regulators without incurring prohibitive real economic costs. In particular  while most state-chartered banks will continue to operate on an intrastate basis in local markets  regional and nationwide banks may find that state charters are burdensome to the extent that the banks are forced to operate under varying regulatory rules and procedures across multiple states. If that burden were to become excessive  banks with interstate operations -- especially interstate retail operations -- would likely turn to the national charter on grounds of simple expediency. For example  I am struck by the fact that the very largest state-chartered banks among the money center institutions are without significant retail operations or without announced intentions to expand retail banking beyond their home states. The rest of the large state-chartered banks  those with assets over $10 billion  consist mainly of lead banks in multi-bank  multi-state holding companies. It seems likely that some of these institutions will seek to consolidate their interstate retail operations under a national bank charter after interstate branching becomes fully operational  unless countervailing forces emerge. The evident superiority of the national charter is not a foregone conclusion  however. For example  the Federal Reserve this past month approved an application by a superregional banking company to consolidate its retail branches in four states under a single state-chartered bank headquartered in Alabama. The consolidation would become effective on or after June 1  1997  when the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking Act becomes operational. Another positive indication of the resiliency of the state charter has been the establishment of the State-Federal Working Group. This cooperative effort involving the states  the CSBS  the Federal Reserve  and the FDIC is contributing importantly to the strengthening of the supervision of state-chartered institutions through a number of initiatives  including the adoption of the State/Federal Protocol. The Protocol and the Nationwide Supervisory Agreement of 1996 spell out the principles and specific actions that would lead to a seamless supervision and examination of interstate  state-chartered banks. Other initiatives of the State-Federal Working Group include greater examination emphasis on bank risk management processes  a more formalized  risk-focused approach to examination  and expanded and more effective use of information technology. It would also be extremely helpful  especially if enacted prior to interstate branching becoming fully operational  if the Congress were to pass the so-called home state rule  which would place state-chartered banks on an equal footing with national banks with regard to permissible activities of branches in a host state. Systemic Risk and the Role of the Federal Reserve By now  we are all acutely aware that the process of “financial reform” is a complex one  with intended and unintended consequences flowing from almost every act of the legislator or regulator. I have focused today on only two aspects of the debate over financial reform  albeit two very important aspects -- the need to maintain our uniquely decentralized banking system  with its reliance on large numbers of relatively small institutions  and the desirability of retaining the dual banking system  with its implicit choice of regulator. Let me conclude by turning to another important facet of the debate over financial reform -- the role of the Federal Reserve in containing systemic risk. It is critical that we guard against diminution of this role as yet another unintended consequence of financial reform. The risk of systemwide disruptions  for better or for worse  is importantly determined by the actions or inactions of our largest  most complex banking organizations. The architects of financial reform  therefore  must necessarily consider how best to supervise risk-taking at these large organizations and  in particular  whether there should be significant umbrella or consolidated supervision of the banking company. BIS Review 49/1997 - 5 - In the past  holding company supervision was concentrated at the bank level  not only because the bank tended to constitute the bulk of risk-taking activities but also because the holding company tended to manage the bank separately from the various nonbank activities of the organization. More recently  however  the focus of supervision of holding companies by the Federal Reserve has been modified to reflect changes in management procedures -- holding companies now tend to manage risk on a consolidated basis across all their bank and nonbank subsidiaries. Risk and profitability measurements  including  for example  risk-adjusted return on capital calculations  most often are made by business line rather than on a subsidiary basis. As banks engage in new or expanded nonbanking activity in the wake of financial reform  it is likely that these activities too would be managed on a consolidated basis. For this reason  and because supervisors recognize that scarce examination resources are often most effectively employed by focusing on risk management processes  our determination of an institution’s safety and soundness increasingly will be based on an analysis of the decisionmaking and internal control processes for the total organization. Such umbrella supervision need not be in any significant way “intrusive”  nor should financial firms be burdened by the extension of bank-like regulation and supervision to their nonbank activities. For some time  the focus of the Fed’s inspections of nonbanking activities of bank holding companies has been to assess the strengths of the individual units and their interrelations with one another and with the bank. Emphasis is placed on the adequacy of risk measurement and managements systems  as well as internal control systems  and only if there is a major deficiency in these areas should the inspection of the nonbank activities become at all intrusive. We intend that this philosophy of holding company supervision will not change as banks are granted extended powers. Finally  I should note that some have questioned not only the need for umbrella supervision but also the need for the Fed’s involvement in such supervision. It is primarily the responsibility of the Federal Reserve to maintain the stability of our overall financial system  including the interconnections between the domestic financial system and world financial markets. This obligation to protect against systemic disruptions cannot be met solely via open market operations and use of the discount window  as powerful as these tools may be. If the past is any guide  financial crises of the future will be unpredictable and unique in nature. The globalization of financial and real markets means that a foreign crisis can impact on the domestic financial system  and vice versa. Our ability to respond quickly and decisively to any systemic threat depends critically on the experience and expertise of the central bank with regard to the institutional detail of the U.S. and foreign financial systems  including our familiarity with payments and settlement systems. Thus  in order to carry out our systemic obligation  the Federal Reserve must be directly involved in the supervision of banks of all sizes and must  in particular  be able to address the problems of large banking companies if one or more of their activities constitute a threat to the stability of the financial system. Conclusions The concerns I have outlined today demonstrate the necessity that the central bank maintain appropriate supervisory authority and  as I hope I have made clear  this authority is best exercised within the current context of the dual banking system  a system that has served us so well over the generations. Financial reform clearly is needed  but financial reform should not be interpreted to mean regulatory reform for its own sake. I am hopeful that reasoned financial reform  based on sound tenets of public policy  can be achieved in a manner that preserves the best components of the current system while introducing the improvements that are long overdue.

r970529a,1997-05-29,https://www.bis.org/review/r970529a.pdf,Mr. Greenspan reviews current monetary policy in the United States (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  8 May 97),Remarks by the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve System  Mr. Alan Greenspan  at the 1997 Haskins Partners Dinner of the Stern School of Business  New York University  New York on 8/5/97.,Mr. Greenspan reviews current monetary policy in the United States Remarks by the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve System  Mr. Alan Greenspan  at the 1997 Haskins Partners Dinner of the Stern School of Business  New York University  New York on 8/5/97. I am pleased to accept this year’s Charles Waldo Haskins Award and have the opportunity to address this distinguished audience on current monetary policy. A central bank’s raising interest rates is rarely popular. But the Federal Reserve’s action on March 25  to tighten the stance of monetary policy  seems to have attracted more than the usual share of attention and criticism. I believe the critics of our action deserve a response. So tonight  I would like to take a few minutes to put this action in the broad context of the Fed’s mandate to promote the stable financial environment that will encourage economic growth. The Federal Open Market Committee raised rates as a form of insurance. It was a small prudent step in the face of the increasing possibility that excessive credit creation  spurred by an overly accommodative monetary policy  might undermine the sustained economic expansion. That expansion has been fostered by the maintenance of low inflation. But the persisting -- indeed increasing -- strength of nominal demand for goods and services suggested to us that monetary policy might not be positioned appropriately to avoid a buildup of inflationary pressures and imbalances that would be incompatible with extending the current expansion into 1998  and hopefully beyond. Even if it should appear in retrospect that we could have skirted the dangers of credit excesses without a modest tightening  the effect on the expansion would be small  temporary  and like most insurance  its purchase to protect against possible adverse outcomes would still be eminently sensible. For the Federal Reserve to remain inactive against a possible buildup of insidious inflationary pressures would be to sanction a threat to the job security and standards of living of too many Americans. As I pointed out in testimony before the Congress in March  the type of economy that we are now experiencing  with strong growth and tight labor markets  has the special advantage of drawing hundreds of thousands of people onto employment payrolls  where they can acquire permanent work skills. Under less favorable conditions they would have remained out of the labor force  or among the long-term unemployed. Moreover  the current more-than-six-year expansion has enabled us to accelerate the modernization of our productive facilities. It has long been the goal of monetary policy to foster the maximum sustainable growth in the American economy. I emphasize sustainable because it is clear from our history that surges in growth financed by excessive credit creation are  by their nature  unsustainable  and  unless contained  threaten the underlying stability of our economy. Such stability  in turn  is necessary to nurture the sources of permanent growth. The Federal Reserve  of late  has been criticized as being too focused on subduing nonexistent inflation and  in the process  being willing to suppress economic growth  retard job expansion  and inhibit real wage gains. On the contrary  our actions to tighten money market conditions in 1994  and again in March of this year  were directed at sustaining and fostering growth in economic activity  jobs  and real wages. Our goal has never been to contain inflation as an end in itself. Prices are only signals of how the economy is functioning. If inflation had no effect on economic growth  we would be much less concerned about inflationary pressures. BIS Review 50/1997 - 2 - But the evidence is compelling that low inflation is necessary to the most favorable performance of the economy. Inflation  as is generally recognized throughout the world  destroys jobs and undermines productivity gains  the foundation for increases in real wages. Low inflation is being increasingly viewed as a necessary condition for sustained growth. It may be an old cliché  but you cannot have a vibrant growing economy without sound money. History is unequivocal on this. The Federal Reserve has not always been successful at maintaining sound money and sustained growth  and the lessons have been costly. The Federal Reserve’s policy actions  the evidence demonstrates  affect the financial markets immediately  but work with a significant lag of several quarters or more on output and employment  and even longer on prices. Too often in the past  policymakers responded late to unfolding economic developments and found they were far behind the curve  so to speak; as a result  their policy actions were creating or accentuating business cycles  rather than sustaining expansion. Those who wish for us  in the current environment  to await clearly visible signs of emerging inflation before acting are recommending we return to a failed regime of monetary policy that cost jobs and living standards. I wish it were otherwise  but there is no alternative to basing policy on what are  unavoidably  uncertain forecasts. As I have indicated to the Congress  we do not base policy on a single best-estimate forecast  but rather on a series of potential outcomes and the possible effects of alternative policies  including judgments of the consequences of taking a policy action that might  in the end  have turned out to be less than optimal. I viewed our small increase in the federal funds rate on March 25 as taken not so much as a consequence of a change in the most probable forecast of moderate growth and low inflation for later this year and next  but rather to address the probability that being wrong had materially increased. In the same sense that it would be folly not to endure the small immediate discomfort of a vaccination against the possibility of getting a serious disease  it would have been folly not to take this small prudent step last March to reduce the probabilities that destabilizing inflation would re-emerge. The risk to the economy from inaction came to outweigh the risk from action. To be sure  1997 is not 1994 when the Fed was forced to tighten monetary conditions very substantially to avoid accommodating rising inflation. Current financial conditions are much less accommodative than they were in 1994. Yet we must be wary. While there is scant evidence of any imminent resurgence of inflation at the moment  there also appears to be little slack in our capacity to produce. Should the expected slowing in the growth of demand fail to materialize  we would need to address any emerging pressures in product and credit markets. To understand the problems of capacity restraint  I should like to spend a few moments on what we have learned over the years about economic growth and the conditions necessary to foster it. First it is useful to distinguish between two quite different types of economic growth. One is true  sustainable growth  the other is not. True growth reflects the capacity of the economic system to produce goods and services and is based on the growth in productivity and in the labor force. BIS Review 50/1997 - 3 - That growth contrasts with the second type  what I would call transitory growth. An economy producing near capacity can expand faster for a short time through excess credit creation. But this is not growth in any meaningful sense of promoting lasting increases in standards of living for our nation. Indeed  it will detract from achieving our long-term goals. Temporary fluctuations in output owing to say  inventory adjustments  but not financed through excess credit  will quickly adjust on their own and need not concern us as much  provided policy is appropriately positioned to foster sustainable growth. When excessive credit fostered by the central bank finances excess demand  history tells us destabilizing inflationary pressures eventually emerge. For a considerable portion of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries  inflationary credit excesses and prices were contained by a gold standard and balanced budgets. Both  however  were deemed too constraining to the achievement of wider social goals as well as for other reasons  and instead the Federal Reserve was given the mandate of maintaining the appropriate degree of liquidity in the system. Over the long haul  the economy’s growth is effectively limited to the expansion of capacity based on productivity and labor force growth. To be sure  it is often difficult to judge whether observed growth is soundly based on productivity or arises from transitory surges in output financed in many cases by excess credit  but this is in part what making monetary policy is all about. In that regard and in the current context  how can we be confident we at the Federal Reserve are not inhibiting the nation reaching its full growth potential? One way is to examine closely the recent economic record. Only two and a half years ago  rising commodity prices  lengthening delivery times  and heavy overtime indicated that our productive facilities were under some strain to meet demand. To be sure  since early 1995  those pressures have eased off. However  given the good pace of economic expansion since then  it would stretch credulity to believe that capacity growth has accelerated at a sufficient pace to produce a large degree of slack at this moment. Capacity utilization in industry is a little below its level through much of 1994  and pressures in product markets have remained tame. However  falling unemployment rates and rising overtime hours -- as well as anecdotal reports -- unambiguously point to growing tightness in labor markets. With tight labor markets and little slack in product markets  we are led to conclude that significant persistent strength in the growth of nominal demand for goods and services  outstripping the likely rate of increase in capacity  will presumably be resisted by higher market interest rates. If  instead  that demand is accommodated for a time by a step up in credit expansion facilitated by monetary policy  increasing pressures on productive resources would sow  as they have in the past  the seeds of even higher interest rates and a consequent subsequent economic retrenchment. This  then  was the context for our recent action. We saw a significant risk that monetary policy was not positioned to promote sustainable economic expansion  and we took a small step to increase the odds that the good performance of the economy can continue. There is another point of view of the current context that merits consideration. It is the notion that  owing largely to technological advance and to freer international trade  the conventional notions of capacity are becoming increasingly outmoded  and that domestic resources can be used much more intensively than in the past without added price pressures. BIS Review 50/1997 - 4 - There is  no doubt  a substantial element of truth in these observations  as I have often noted in the past. Computer and telecommunication based technologies are truly revolutionizing the way we produce goods and services. This has imparted a substantially increased degree of flexibility into the workplace  which in conjunction with just-in-time inventory strategies and increased availability of products from around the world  has kept costs in check through increased productivity. Our production system and the notion of capacity are far more flexible than they were ten or twenty years ago. Nonetheless  any inference that our productive capacity is essentially unlimited is clearly unwarranted. As I pointed out earlier  judging from a number of tangible signs of strains on facilities  we were producing near capacity in early 1995  and it is just not credible that an economy as vast and complex as that of the United States could have changed its underlying structure in the short time since then. If we consider the current rate of true  sustainable growth unsatisfactory  are there policies which could augment it? In my view  improving productivity and standards of living necessitates increasing incentives to risk taking. To encourage people to take prudent risks  the potential rewards must be perceived to exceed the possible losses. Maintaining low inflation rates reduces the levels of future uncertainties and  hence  increases the scope of investment opportunities. It is here that the Federal Reserve can most contribute to long-term growth. Other government policies also can affect these perceptions. For example  lower marginal tax rates and capital gains taxes would increase the return to successful investments and  thus  the incentive to initiate them. In addition  coming to grips now with the outsized projected growth in entitlement spending in the early years of the next century could have a profound effect on current expectations of stability. Early actions could bring real long-term interest rates down  also increasing the scope of investment opportunities. And  clearly  removing the federal deficit’s drain on private savings would help to finance such private investment. Deregulation  by increasing the flexibility in the deployment of our capital and management resources  can also make a decided contribution to growth. The deregulation of telecommunications  motor and rail transport  utilities  and financial services  to name a few  may have done more to foster America’s competitive market efficiencies than we can readily document. Finally  though not a function of government policies  is the continued good pace of productivity growth this late in the business expansion. This cyclical pattern is contrary to our experience and it suggests there may be an undetected delayed bonus from technical and managerial efficiencies coming from the massive advances in computer and telecommunications technology applications over the last two decades. If so  it is important that we nurture it with adequate incentives -- at a minimum  eschew regulations and taxation that reduce most incentives -- for this may well be one source of our low inflation environment. While productivity improvement through capital investment and technological advance is clearly central to the process of economic growth  the pace and quality of labor force expansion is additive to productivity growth in achieving overall gains in GDP. Hence  appropriate upgrading of skills through education and training should go with any menu to expand economic growth. BIS Review 50/1997 - 5 - Looking ahead  there are many reasons to be optimistic about the economy’s prospects. For a vast nation such as ours at the cutting edge of technology  a large pickup in productivity growth is difficult to envisage. But appropriate incentives advancing that cutting edge can augment growth in a material way. And cumulatively  over time even a modest acceleration in productivity would very significantly improve the standards of living of our children. The twenty-first century will pose many challenges to our ingenuity to develop new and sophisticated ways of creating economic value. But with the competitive benefits of increasingly open markets  I have little doubt we Americans will meet the challenge admirably. BIS Review 50/1997

For more than three decades  this conference has focused our attention on key issues facing banks  their customers  and regulators. Its proceedings have chronicled a remarkable and ongoing transformation of the U.S. financial services industry. At the time of the first gathering in 1963  our financial system was highly segmented  with commercial banks  savings and loans  investment banks  insurance companies  and finance companies providing distinctly separate products. Statutes and regulations greatly restricted competition between banks and nonbanks  and among banks themselves. Today  the marketplace for financial services is intensely competitive  innovative  and global. Banks and nonbanks  domestic and foreign  now compete aggressively across a broad range of on- and off-balance-sheet financial activities. It is noteworthy that  for the most part  this transformation has not been propelled by sweeping legislative reforms. Rather  the primary driving forces have been advances in computing  telecommunications  and theoretical finance that  taken together  have eroded economic and regulatory barriers to competition  de facto. Technology has fundamentally reshaped how financial products are created and how these products are delivered  received  and employed by end-users. In my remarks this morning  I plan to discuss two aspects of this process of technological change. First is the recurring theme of financial products being unbundled into their component parts  including the unbundling of credit  market  and other risks. These developments have worked to enhance the competitiveness and efficiency of the financial system and  at the same time  to provide financial institutions and their customers with better tools for managing risks. A byproduct is that our largest and most complex financial organizations increasingly are measuring and managing risk on a centralized basis. This trend seems irreversible  and in my view provides a compelling reason for maintaining some type of umbrella supervision over banking organizations  especially as we contemplate repeal of Glass- Steagall and other restrictions on the activities of banking organizations. The second theme I want to explore is the large element of uncertainty underlying technological progress. Reflecting this uncertainty  it is inherently very difficult to predict the extent to which government policies may distort the private sector’s incentives to innovate. This argues for supervisory and regulatory policies that are more “incentive-compatible”  in the sense that they are reinforced by market discipline and the profit-maximizing incentives of bank owners and managers. To the extent this can be achieved  and I believe we have taken some innovative steps in this direction  supervisory and regulatory policies will be both less burdensome and more effective. Unbundling of Financial Services The unbundling of financial products is now extensive throughout our financial system. Perhaps the most obvious example is the ever-expanding array of financial derivatives available to help firms manage interest rate risk  other market risks  and  increasingly  credit risks. Derivatives are now used routinely to separate the total risk of more generic products into component parts associated with various risk factors. These components frequently are repackaged into synthetic products having risk profiles that mimic financial instruments in other BIS Review 50/1997 - 2 - markets. The synthetic products can then be resold to those investors most willing and able to bear the associated risks. Another far-reaching innovation is the technology of securitization -- a form of derivative -- which has encouraged unbundling of the production processes for many credit services. Securitization permits separate financial institutions to originate  service  fund  and assume the credit or market risks of a portfolio of loans or other assets. Thus  a financial institution may specialize in those activities where it has particular expertise or other comparative advantages. For example  to reduce the costs of originating and securitizing certain types of household loans  the underwriting processes used by some financial institutions rely on highly automated credit-scoring models developed by third-party vendors. These models  in turn  typically are linked to huge databases on borrower characteristics maintained independently by national credit bureaus. Numerous types of assets are now routinely securitized  including residential mortgages  commercial mortgages  auto loans  and credit card loans. In addition  medium- and large-size businesses  including some that are below investment-grade  regularly access the commercial paper market by securitizing their trade accounts or other assets. Recently  securitization and credit-scoring are beginning to be applied to small business lending. These and other developments facilitating the unbundling of financial products have surely improved the efficiency of our financial markets. One benefit is greater economic specialization  as banks and other financial institutions are able to create market niches  for example  in cash management  investment management  or the origination or servicing of certain loans. Moreover  by lowering the costs of hedging and financial arbitrage  derivatives and securitization work to enhance market liquidity and reduce both absolute risk premiums and disparities in risk premiums across financial instruments and geographic regions. Unbundling also has lowered economic barriers to competition  affording households and businesses a greater choice of potential providers for financial products. The ability to unbundle permits potential competitors to target highly specific product- or market- attributes  for which existing providers are earning excessive “rents.” Through credit-scoring and direct-mail marketing  for instance  a financial institution can identify and recruit potentially profitable credit card customers over a wide geographic area  without incurring the costs associated with a large branch network. According to our Survey of Consumer Finances  for example  84 percent of general purpose credit cards held by U.S. households in 1995 were issued by financial institutions from which the card holder received no other financial service. In addition  unbundling has helped erode legal barriers to competition  by enabling one or more attributes of a product to be modified in order to exploit statutory or regulatory “loopholes.” A classic example  of course  is the introduction of money market mutual funds  which ultimately forced the removal of Regulation Q interest rate ceilings on deposit accounts. It is important to recognize that these developments would not have been possible without complementary advances in technology across several disciplines. First  innovations in finance theory  such as the principle of financial arbitrage and models for pricing contingent claims  provided a conceptual framework for understanding and modeling financial risks. Second  advances in computer and communications technologies have made these conceptual innovations economically feasible  by lowering the costs associated with information processing and with the transmission of large volumes of data over long distances. BIS Review 50/1997 - 3 - Besides promoting competition and improved products and production efficiencies  these same technological advances have spawned a sea-change in the risk management practices of financial institutions. The largest and most sophisticated banking organizations increasingly have centralized their risk management at the parent level -- cutting across legal entities and financial instruments. This new management paradigm is grounded in the same conceptual techniques employed by financial engineers to unbundle the total risk of an individual asset. Such techniques rely on the financial engineer’s ability to model the relationship between an individual asset’s economic value and a number of separate risk factors. Carrying this process further  the relationship between these risk factors and the value of an overall portfolio can be obtained by summing the relationships for the individual underlying assets. With the processing power of modern computers  it is now possible to estimate the joint probability distribution of many risk factors and  given this distribution  to simulate the probability distributions of losses for large  complex portfolios. Over the past decade or so  the largest banking organizations have invested substantial sums to hire the staff and to create the software  databases  and related management information systems to carry out such computations. Most of you are aware of the application of this technology in VAR  or “value-at-risk”  models  which are used to estimate loss distributions for trading portfolios. More recently  many large banking organizations have begun using similar technologies to measure the credit risk in their loan portfolios. In both applications  the measurements of overall portfolio risk are used to determine the prices for loans and other products needed to achieve hurdle rates-of-return on shareholder equity  to assess the adequacy of an organization’s overall equity capital  as well as for other management purposes. These efforts to develop more centralized risk management systems are being driven by normal competitive pressures to maximize synergies within financial organizations  such as joint-production and cross-selling opportunities involving multiple subsidiaries. This  in turn  is the logical outcome of the organization’s desire to produce and market its products most efficiently and to achieve the highest risk-adjusted returns for shareholders. Such synergies cannot occur if the parent is merely a passive portfolio investor in its subsidiaries. Reflecting this economic reality  virtually all large bank holding companies are now operated and managed as integrated units. The trend toward centralized risk management raises some fundamental policy issues for how we should regulate and supervise large  complex banking organizations. Chief among these  this trend raises serious doubts regarding suggestions that we rely solely on decentralized “functional regulation” as we move to expand further the permissible activities of banking organizations. The traditional view of the functional approach to regulating a banking organization would involve a bank regulator supervising the insured bank  the SEC supervising any broker/dealer subsidiary  a state insurance department supervising any insurance subsidiary  and so on. Each functional regulator would look only at the risk management practices of the regulated entity under its supervision; unregulated subsidiaries  including the parent  would be unsupervised. Before technology advanced to a point where substantial oversight and control of large banking organizations could be consolidated at the parent level  functional regulation conformed with practical limitations on the abilities of managers to coordinate resources  and evaluate risks  for the organizations as a whole. In essence  a decentralized approach to BIS Review 50/1997 - 4 - regulation followed from the decentralized financial decisionmaking process of its day. To borrow a concept from architecture: form followed function. In today’s world  however  the “form”  decentralized regulation  no longer follows the “function”  centralized risk management. Almost by definition  the synergies upon which centralized management is predicated imply that neither a subsidiary’s economic condition on a going-concern basis nor its exposure to potential risks can be evaluated independently of the condition and management policies of the consolidated organization. Regulation must fit the architecture of what is being regulated. To give one example  it is common for complex banking organizations to manage the relationships with large customers centrally  even though the underlying cash management  credit  or capital markets services provided to the customer may transcend several subsidiaries. Under this framework  the way the organization’s internal transfer pricing system allocates costs  revenues  and risks to a specific regulated entity may be somewhat arbitrary  or even misleading. Yet  a functional regulator -- looking only at the entity under its supervision -- generally would have insufficient information to validate the reasonableness of these allocations. A purely decentralized regulatory approach would also greatly diminish our ability to evaluate and contain potential systemic disruptions in the financial system  since no regulator would be responsible for monitoring the consolidated banking organization. We should remember that one of the primary motivations of a society having a central bank and a safety net is precisely to limit systemic risk. Partly in recognition of the fact that financial organizations are managed on a consolidated basis  financial markets generally view them as single economic entities. Thus  troubles in the nongovernment-regulated portion of a bank holding company cannot be expected to leave the government-regulated subsidiaries unscathed. In a worst case scenario  problems in one part of an organization could precipitate a run at a healthy affiliate bank and could even generate spillover effects onto nonaffiliated banks. It is worth noting that recent deposit insurance and depositor preference legislation may increase these concerns  by exposing uninsured creditors of banks to a greater risk of loss than in the past. While these new initiatives have the significant benefit of strengthening market discipline  they may also induce some additional systemic risks  even for healthy banks  in periods characterized by heightened levels of economic uncertainty. We don’t have much experience  yet  in operating under these new ground rules. For all of these reasons  I believe we must continue to have some type of umbrella supervision for banking organizations  especially for the largest and most complex organizations that pose the greatest systemic risk concerns. In my judgment  therefore  the critical challenge is to develop approaches to implementing umbrella supervision that are effective in limiting systemic risk without distorting economic incentives or being unduly burdensome to banking organizations. Innovation  Uncertainty  and Bank Supervision If history is our guide  market innovations -- with or without supporting legislation -- will continue to stimulate financial modernization. As this process unfolds  we can expect banking organizations to undertake an increasing number of financial activities. Under these circumstances  policymakers face a very difficult tradeoff: namely  balancing the need for financial stability and umbrella supervision  on the one hand  against our desire to avoid extending bank-like regulation and the safety net over these new activities. BIS Review 50/1997 - 5 - In addressing this tradeoff  policymakers also have an obligation to consider the potential effects of their policies  unintended as well as intended  on the process of financial innovation. Technological progress has been a critical element in rising living standards. This is not surprising  because the creation and diffusion of innovations have represented voluntary decisions by individuals and firms acting in their own self-interests. Government policies always pose some risk of misdirecting or distorting this process by interfering with normal competitive market mechanisms. This concern is particularly relevant to the financial sector  whose innovations seem to be especially attuned to the risk-return incentives created by the safety net and regulatory policies. Designing government policies that minimize the potentially disruptive effects on private incentives to innovate is complicated by how little we really understand the process of innovation and technological change. Forecasting the direction or pace of technological change has proved to be especially precarious over the generations  even for relatively mature industries. While uncertainty is inherent in any creative process  Nathan Rosenberg of Stanford suggests that even after an innovation’s technical feasibility has been clearly established  its ultimate effect on society is often highly unpredictable. He notes at least two sources of this uncertainty. First  the range of applications for a new technology may not be immediately apparent. For instance  Alexander Graham Bell initially viewed the telephone as solely a business instrument -- merely an enhancement of the telegraph -- for use in transmitting very specific messages  such as the terms of a contract. Indeed  he offered to sell his telephone patent to Western Union for only $100 000  but was turned down. Similarly  Guglielmo Marconi initially overlooked the radio’s value as a public broadcast medium  instead believing its principal application would be in the transmission of point-to-point messages  such as ship-to- ship  where communication by wire was infeasible. A second source of technological uncertainty reflects the possibility that an innovation’s full potential may be realizable only after extensive improvements  or after complementary innovations in other fields of science. According to Charles Townes  a Nobel Prize winner for his work on the laser  the attorneys for Bell Labs initially refused  in the 1960s  to patent the field of telecommunications. Only in the 1980s  after extensive improvements in fiber optics technology  did the laser’s importance for telecommunications become apparent. it had no applications they believed laser because the in It’s not hard to find examples of such uncertainties within the financial services industry. The evolution of the OTC derivatives market over the past decade has been nothing less than spectacular. But as the theoretical underpinnings of financial arbitrage were being published by Modigliani and Miller in the late 1950s  few observers could have predicted how their insights would eventually revolutionize global financial markets. This is because  in addition to their insights  at least two complementary innovations had to fall into place. The first was further conceptual advances in contingent claims theory  such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The second was several generations of advances in computer and communications technologies that were necessary to make these concepts computationally practicable. Given the high degree of uncertainty inherent in the development of new products and processes  policymakers should be cautious when attempting to anticipate the future path of innovation  or the effects new regulations may have on innovation. There are several aspects to this innovation. First  banking organizations may develop new products or innovations to exploit regulatory “loopholes”  or interaction between government policies and market BIS Review 50/1997 - 6 - they may decline to develop new products whose likely regulatory treatments are viewed as burdensome or unclear. Another unintended consequence is that a policy action may establish an inappropriate unofficial government standard for how certain activities should be conducted. In contrast to government standards  which can be extremely difficult to change  when the private sector adopts a standard that subsequently becomes outmoded  market forces generally can be expected to remedy the situation. The history of retail electronic payments provides a useful illustration. In the 1970s  when many were heralding the advent of a “cashless society”  the Federal Reserve and the Treasury played an important role in developing and promoting what was seen as a key component of this vision -- the automated clearinghouse system. Now  twenty years later  we know that while the ACH has been successful in some areas  it has failed to replace a substantial portion of the daily flow of paper checks in the economy. This experience leads me to conclude that the experimentation with innovative electronic payment methods that we are seeing today in the private sector is likely to have a much better chance of meeting the needs of consumers and businesses than did the government-led initiatives two decades ago. Within the context of banking regulation  concerns about setting a potentially inappropriate regulatory standard were an important factor in the decision by the banking agencies several years ago not to incorporate interest rate risk and asset concentration risk into the formal risk-based capital standards. In the end  we became convinced that the technologies for measuring and managing interest rate risk and concentration risk were evolving so rapidly that any regulatory standard would quickly become outmoded or  worse  inhibit private market innovations. Largely for these reasons  ultimately we chose to address the relationship between these risks and capital adequacy through the supervisory process. I believe that in many cases  policymakers can reduce potential distortions by structuring policies to be more “incentive-compatible” -- that is  by working with  rather than around  the profit-maximizing goals of investors and firm managers. In light of the underlying uncertainties illustrated in my earlier examples  I readily acknowledge this is often easier said than done. Nevertheless  I believe some useful guiding principles can be formulated. The first guiding principle is that  where possible  we should attempt to strengthen market discipline  without compromising financial stability. As financial transactions become increasingly rapid and complex  I believe we have no choice but to harness market forces  as best we can  to reinforce our supervisory objectives. The appeal of market-led discipline lies not only in its cost-effectiveness and flexibility  but also in its limited intrusiveness and its greater adaptability to changing financial environments. Measures to enhance market discipline involve providing private investors the incentives and the means to reward good bank performance and penalize poor performance. Expanded risk management disclosures by financial institutions is a significant step in this direction. In addition  Congress has undertaken important initiatives  including a national depositor preference statute and the least-cost resolution and prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIC Improvement Act. Of course  the value of these initiatives will depend on the credibility of regulators in implementing the legislative mandates consistently over time. A second guiding principle is that  to the extent possible  our regulatory policies should attempt to simulate what would be the private market’s response in the absence of the safety net. Such a principle suggests that supervisory and regulatory policies  like market responses  should be capable of evolving over time  along with changes in institutional practices BIS Review 50/1997 - 7 - and financial technologies. Almost certainly  such a principle implies that we avoid locking ourselves into formulaic  one-size-fits-all approaches to measuring and affecting bank safety and soundness. For example  as a bank’s internal systems for measuring and managing market  credit  and operating risks improve with advances in technology and finance  our supervisory policies should become more tailored to that bank’s specific needs and internal management processes. Recently  we have taken several steps that attempt to operationalize this concept  including the introduction of an internal models approach to assessing capital for market risks in large banks’ trading accounts. Also  as I am sure most of you are aware  the Board is currently pilot-testing with the New York Clearing House Association an alternative capital allocation procedure for market risk  called the “pre-commitment” approach. The pre-commitment approach would permit capital requirements for market risk to reflect not only the estimates of risk derived from a bank’s internal market-risk model  but also other features of the bank’s trading risk management system that help limit its overall risk exposure -- such as the effectiveness of its internal controls and other risk-management tools. Conclusions Over the last three decades  the folly of attempting to legislate or regulate against the primal forces of the market is one of the most fundamental lessons learned by banking regulators. If those market forces are driving financial firms toward centralized decisionmaking regarding risk  pricing  and other operational issues  it will be difficult  at best  to implement a decentralized approach to prudential regulation  however attractive its apparent simplicity. Similarly  in the face of continual market-driven innovations in banks’ risk measurement and management systems  regulatory approaches based on rigid  one-size-fits-all rules are likely to become quickly outdated  ineffectual  and  worse  potentially counterproductive. Incentive-compatible regulation  flexibly constructed and applied  is the logical alternative to an increasingly complex system of rigid rules and regulations that inevitably have unintended consequences  including possible deleterious effects on the innovation process. While I have discussed some examples of incentive-compatible regulation that appear to be working  we have a very long way to go. For example  banking regulators have yet to reach a consensus on some of the most basic questions associated with prudential supervision -- questions such as what is an appropriate conceptual basis for assessing a financial institution’s overall risk exposure  how should such risk exposures be measured  and if we use internal management models for such measurements  how can these models be validated? The revolution in risk measurement techniques makes the answers to these questions approachable but not without significant effort on the part of the regulators and the financial industry itself. I am confident that all parties are both willing and able to solve the challenges that confront us. It is clearly in our mutual self-interest to do so. Our success will preserve not only the benefits of the most competitive and innovative financial markets in the world  but also the benefits of financial stability that are critical to our economy.

Vincenzo Desario  before the conference on ""Italian society at the turn of the millennium: opportunities and prospects of the non-profit and voluntary sector"" held in Milan on 17/3/97.","Mr. Desario looks at the financial system and the non-profit sector with respect to ethics and solidarity in finance Address by the Director General of the Bank of Italy  Dott. Vincenzo Desario  before the conference on “Italian society at the turn of the millennium: opportunities and prospects of the non-profit and voluntary sector” held in Milan on 17/3/97. The importance of the non-profit and voluntary sector is now appreciable not only ethically and culturally  as a tendency whose expansion bears witness to the human and civic development of Italian society  but also on the economic plane. Everywhere  substantial budget deficits are forcing a retrenchment of public spending and more generally an attenuation of direct government involvement in the economy. It follows that non-profit and voluntary organizations may play an ever-larger role in reducing social disparities  devising modes of intervention appropriate to the continually changing forms in which inequality arises. In Italy the need for a larger and stronger non-profit and voluntary sector is especially great  owing to the necessity of fiscal adjustment and the inefficiency afflicting public services. My remarks the relationships between ethics  solidarity and finance. I shall follow this with a description of the non-profit sector and some observations on banking foundations. Finally I shall examine the funding of the non-profit sector and its relations with the banking system. today begin with some preliminary considerations on 1. Ethics  solidarity and finance The changes in Italy’s credit and financial system in recent years reflect the concern of law-makers and supervisors to foster market values and competition. The principles of transparency and fairness in relations between banks and customers not only are embedded in rules of conduct but have now been given the status of purposes of supervisory activity by Legislative Decree 415 of 23 July 1996 transposing the EU Investment Services Directive into Italian law. Reference to these principles is not merely ritual. It bids us to recognize that the operating environment has been radically transformed and now  even more than in the past  demands the firm commitment of intermediaries to comply with the letter and the spirit of the rules of good faith and fairness. These values are inextricably bound up with the relationship between bank and customer  which is based on trust. They make it easier to face the challenges of competition. They promote customer loyalty and enhance the bank’s reputation in the market. Trust is essential to the operation and growth of the economy. As the Nobel Laureate Kenneth Arrow has observed “Virtually every commercial transaction has within itself an element of trust  certainly any transaction conducted over a period of time. It can be plausibly argued that much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence.” 1 1 K.J. Arrow  ""Gifts and Exchanges""  Philosophy and Public Affairs ( 1972). BIS Review 51/1997 - 2 - The risk of a self-serving breach of trust by economic agents is one of the main sources of transaction costs  in that it necessitates performance bonds and monitoring the counterparty’s behaviour. The most effective way of reducing transaction costs is for market participants to adhere to the precept that it is one’s moral duty to respect others and not to betray their trust. Widely shared ethical precepts and moral conduct strengthen agents’ credibility and reliability  make it easier to reach new business agreements and ultimately increase the likelihood of success. In a market economy the credit system has the important function of selecting creditworthy projects  economic initiatives that can produce new benefits and increase overall social welfare. It is essential for every bank to screen borrowers by strictly professional standards based on technical assessment of projects’ risks and returns. Inefficient assessment of creditworthiness results in significant losses. In markets where there is little competition  poor asset quality is reflected in higher interest rates  with adverse repercussions on the economy as a whole. In more competitive markets  with their narrower spreads  loan losses can lead to bank failures. And this affects other outstanding loans  causes jobs to be lost and wipes out uninsured depositors’ savings  with the risk that the failure may spread. Customer confidence is the banking enterprise’s most valuable intangible asset. It is the prerequisite for building stronger and more durable customer relations that can be broadened from simple loan disbursement to the entire range of firms’ financial needs. With trust  there is a better likelihood that the relationship between bank and customer will be consolidated as a “repeated game” in which  as game theory teaches  the problems of opportunistic behaviour are overcome.2 This approach can be successful if the bank does not act in conflict of interest; if  that is  it safeguards the interests of the customer together with its own  recommending financing plans and instruments that are compatible with the customer’s projects  the state of the firm and the prospects of its market. In finance  solidarity can be expressed by paying more attention to the customer’s needs  viewed comprehensively  and assisting the customer in making financial choices that best serve the realization of corporate goals. Any short-term earnings loss will be offset by the future income the bank will obtain as a result of the continuity of the relationship and from additional corporate financial services. The principle of overcoming conflict of interest also informs proper and transparent relations with savers who entrust the bank with making an investment or managing their financial assets. The intermediary that reconciles its own interest with the customer’s  that makes customer assistance a conscious value of its corporate culture  perceiving it as a tool of competition  has a better chance of success in the financial markets. 2 See  for example  K.G. Binmore  Game Theory and the Social Contract  II Just Playing (Cambridge  Mass.  1994). BIS Review 51/1997 - 3 - The rule that one who acts on behalf of another must protect the latter’s interest and not make undisclosed profits from this management activity is clearly ethical in origin. It was first stated  as regards the law of trusts  in the Middle Ages in sentences handed down by the Chancellor of the King of England; that is  by a judge  ordinarily also a bishop  who decided lawsuits mainly on the basis of ethical and religious canons. Effective  correct customer assistance is premised upon thorough knowledge of the customer. The “know your customer” rule has been reaffirmed recently by Italian financial legislation. Law 1/1991  as well as the more recent legislative decree transposing the EU Investment Services Directive  lays down that in carrying on securities activities the investment firm must “acquire prior information about the financial situation of customers that is relevant to the conduct of the activity.” This principle was made applicable to the entire banking and financial industry with the publication of the Bank of Italy’s anti-money-laundering “Decalogue”  which stresses that familiarity with the customer is essential not only for detecting suspect transactions but also for maintaining stable customer relations. Intermediaries have increasingly recognized the importance and the positive implications of this rule. Appreciable steps towards self-regulation have been taken  such as the code of conduct for banks  adopted in 1996  which sets standards of fairness in dealings with customers. When they enjoy real consensus  such initiatives are an especially effective tool for reinforcing and extending the rules of professional ethics  because they are not imposed from above but reflect the shared feelings of those involved. In the public interest and in conformity with the law  the supervisory authorities lay down prudential standards and rules of conduct covering all intermediaries. The authorities are careful not to impose costs that are not justified by greater benefits to the community as a whole. They are guided by the best practices of the market. They check that intermediaries act consistently with the principle of sound and prudent management. Management that is sound - i.e. in accordance with the rules derived from experience and the theory of enterprise (profitability)  not subject to improper influences (independence) and based on correct business relations - and prudent - i.e. sensitive to risk - will have beneficial results in terms of the orderly and efficient operation of the economic and financial system. Sound and prudent management is an overarching criterion for supervisory activity. It sums up the values of stability  efficiency  integrity and proper functioning of the financial system. It is where systemic objectives and microeconomic goals meet. As a norm  it requires that intermediaries’ dealings with firms and households be constantly inspired by the canons of business and professional ethics  transparency  legality  fair competition. Sound and prudent management is at once a technical rule and an ethical canon. Safeguarding competition also carries a deep ethical significance. Abuse of a dominant position  price fixing  or collusive agreement on practices to the detriment of consumers allows intermediaries to reap unjustified profits and excludes those who cannot pay the fixed prices from enjoying the relevant services. Such practices generate both inefficiency and inequity. BIS Review 51/1997 2. The non-profit and voluntary sector - 4 - An abiding school of thought embracing analysts of differing backgrounds holds that a democratic political system  if it is to be deeply rooted in the social fabric  must be articulated in a tightknit web of organizations positioned between the individual and the state: collective actors that enable citizens themselves to “become the state” by directly administering and providing socially useful services. As the French sociologist Emile Durkheim stressed  a nation can be said to exist only if between the state and private citizens there is a whole series of secondary groups close enough to individuals to draw them forcefully into their field of action and so involve them in the mainstream of social life.3 The grass-roots presence of associations  mutual societies  communities and clubs  networks of civic commitment  is seen by some scholars as a decisive factor in establishing a climate of reciprocal confidence and social cooperation  which is necessary to launch a virtuous circle of economic development.4 The non-profit sector is defined essentially by two traits: private ownership and control and a ban on distributing profits. The latter feature does not imply that a non-profit body cannot ever generate profits; what counts is that any net profits must be reinvested in the pursuit and expansion of the organization’s activity  to finance its mandated purposes. It may seem surprising that in a market economy one finds associations  clubs  mutual societies  leagues and private cooperatives providing services without distributing profits and almost always operating alongside other institutions  such as the family  the state  and business corporations. Yet historical experience teaches that the state-market dichotomy does not exhaust all the ramifications of a modern economic and social system. In economic theory the most widely accepted explanations for the existence of non-profit enterprises bear on market “failures”  which are generally related to information asymmetries  i.e. cases in which the independent contracting power of agents does not ensure sufficient transparency or comparability of services and products. Especially where service quality is difficult to ascertain  there is room for the rise and growth of non-profit enterprises. For the consumer  the ban on distributing profits is a signal that the provider will not raise the price of the service without just cause or reduce its quality. Similar assurance is offered to those who wish to make donations to non-profit agencies that assist the weak and the needy. The ban on distributing profits fosters and strengthens the bonds of trust between users  private donors and the service organization. It is a deterrent to the involvement of workers and managers who would be inclined to pursue their own individual interests  those who are less socially committed. 3 E. Durkheim  The Division of Labour in Society (1893). 4 R.D. Putnam  Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy (Princeton  N.J.  Princeton University Press  1993). BIS Review 51/1997 - 5 - The private non-profit organization has comparative advantages not only as against business corporations but also with respect to public provision of goods and services  especially those earmarked for particular segments of society. By virtue of more efficient collection and processing of “local” information  i.e. within circumscribed territories  non-profit agencies cater more effectively to the particular needs of specific social groups or sectors. These are services that require more of a grass-roots presence and a greater capacity to target action to non-standardized needs. The state retains a comparative advantage in the provision of undifferentiated public services  such as compulsory schooling  basic health care  and social security. The non-profit and voluntary sector can play a major role in supplementing public programmes and in broadening the area of social protection. It must become a mechanism for soliciting and raising additional private resources  over and above government appropriations for these purposes  in order to meet those needs that state action is inefficient in facing. Italy’s unbalanced economic development has been accompanied by phenomena of social distress and has not succeeded  to date  in narrowing regional disparities. The growth and spread of social solidarity  volunteer service and the entire non-profit sector is highly desirable to reinforce the pact of mutual support binding the national community at the institutional level and to make for fruitful  complementary relations between private and public social welfare activities. Delay in the development of the non-profit sector and excessive reduction of the social role of the state  albeit for budgetary reasons  could place the whole burden of assisting society’s most vulnerable members on the family. Owing to the changes in society  the family is no longer capable  unaided  of dealing with the complicated problems posed by the modern world. 3. The fight against usury: a case of complementarity between government and voluntary action Solidarity means disinterested assistance to those in need. The traditional ethical condemnation of lending at interest  found in the Old Testament and in Aristotle  can be traced back to the ethical principle of solidarity whereby one must help the needy person  not take advantage of his need. Leviticus reads: “And if thy brother be waxen poor  and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him; yea  though he be a stranger  or a sojourner; that he may live with thee. Take thou no usury of him  or increase.... Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury  nor lend him thy victuals for increase.”5 The passage from condemnation of charging of interest to the needy to the outright condemnation of interest as such  found in other books of the Old Testament 6 is logical in the historical context of a static  agrarian economy in which recourse to credit is not a normal event for anyone engaging in economic activity but the last resort of victims of exceptional adversity. Even today  the exploitation of the weakness of those in need is an element in 5 Leviticus 25  35-37. See also Exodus 22  25. 6 For example  Ezekiel 18  13. BIS Review 51/1997 - 6 - usury  an odious and socially destructive practice that has taken on alarming dimensions in recent years. The problem is delicate  complicated  and because of its emotional impact proper analysis of the issue requires an effort of intellectual lucidity to avoid the sort of crude judgments that surface from time to time in the discussion. The alleged inflexibility of legal intermediaries in granting loans is often cited as a contributing cause of usury. But banks operate with the funds of their depositors  which it is their duty to safeguard; accordingly they lend to those customers who are in a position to honour their obligations. By using the savings it has collected in the most efficient manner and protecting their value through sound and prudent management  the banking enterprise performs its important economic function  combining private profit-seeking with the general interest. It may be that some high-risk borrowers  at the margins of the credit market  find it hard to obtain “legal” credit. These borrowers  who tend to be small businesses even more commonly than households  may fall prey to usurers  through no fault of the legitimate intermediaries subject to supervision. Italy’s 1996 anti-usury law accords official recognition to the role played by the voluntary sector in sparing enterprises and households the risk of having to turn to usurers. The main instrument for combating usury is government grants to non-profit foundations and associations that already administer resources deriving from private donations  to be used as security for bank loans at moderate rates of interest to persons in financial difficulty. Italy counts a good number of associations engaged in the battle against usury. There are eight officially recognized foundations active in prevention and assistance to victims. Six operate in the central and southern regions  where usury is most widespread and perilous  owing to its links with organized crime. 4. The banking foundations As I mentioned  non-profit enterprises develop in sectors where pronounced informational asymmetries between customers and service providers lead the public to prefer services supplied by undertakings that do not distribute profits. Informational asymmetries are a distinguishing feature of the banking and financial sector. These two points may help to shed light on the creation of banks in the form of associations or foundations (savings banks first and foremost)  which reached its peak during the nineteenth century. These institutions served to counter usury and to overcome the aversion of “first-generation” savers towards the banking system. The great banking crises of the thirties fortified the role of the public banks  which served to restore savers’ confidence in the banking system and allowed an orderly flow of financing to the economy. The development of the Italian economy and decades of financial stability safeguarded by an effective system of public supervision brought a considerable part of the population into contact with the banking system. The evolution of markets and their increasing BIS Review 51/1997 - 7 - openness brought the public banks’ entrepreneurial features increasingly to the fore  with a corresponding de-emphasis of their original social functions. The reform of the public banks that Parliament enacted at the beginning of the nineties in response to these tendencies sanctioned the passing of the public law model of banking; the law separated the institutions’ original social-welfare and charitable purposes from banking activity  assigning the former to the foundations and the latter to companies limited by shares The most compelling reason for the reform  at the urging of the supervisory authorities  was to allow the introduction of organizational and operational models able to ensure higher standards of competitiveness and efficiency. An important factor was the central role assigned to banks’ capital by the supervisory system then being forged at Community level; the limited scope for Italian public banks to raise funds directly in the equity market hindered their growth and ability to compete. The legislative solution adopted - the original institutions to remain in existence after transferring their banking activity to companies limited by shares - also sought to exploit the valuable social and civic function that most of the public credit institutions had historically performed. Initially  the reform legislation was basically neutral concerning the practical options for the banking foundations; it defined the spectrum of activities open to them  clearly drew the border between banks and foundations  and laid down what the latter could not do  namely manage banks. The remodeled foundations’ sizable endowments fueled expectations that they might satisfy the growing financial needs of the voluntary and non-profit sector. The banking foundations  it was felt  could fill the gap left by the shrinking of the welfare state; but in order to occupy a central position in the nonprofit sector  it was argued  they had to dispose of their equity interests in banks at once. However  realizing the full potential of the banking foundations requires that they cease being regarded as a pool of resources to be dipped into indiscriminately or as a body of assets whose composition can be altered in order to pursue the most diverse purposes. The foundations are non-profit operators themselves and can actively contribute to the non-profit sector’s development by identifying areas for intervention and nurturing socially useful initiatives. In deciding how to go about pursuing their objectives  the foundations can adopt a directly operational setup and manage one or more socially useful activities themselves  under arrangements already adopted elsewhere and not new to Italy. If they should decide instead to continue in the role of grant-making institutions  in order to make a truly effective contribution they must develop sufficient skills in selecting initiatives  monitoring the use of funds and assessing results. Grant-making plainly entails a degree of specialization  not only geographic but also by sector of socially useful activity. In effect  the data assembled by the Association of Italian Savings Banks (ACRI) via reclassification of the banking foundations’ annual accounts and a survey of the grants made by the 81 ex-savings bank foundations offers evidence of growing specialization. Sorting the foundations by sectoral concentration of grants shows that BIS Review 51/1997 - 8 - 60.5 per cent allocated over half of their funding to a single sector or more than sixth tenths to just two sectors in 1995. There is some tendency away from small grants  although these are still very common among the smaller foundations  and considerable growth in multi-year grants  whose share in total disbursements rose from 7.7 per cent in 1994 to 11.6 per cent in 1995. According to the ACRI report  disbursements amounted to 211 billion lire in 1995  equal to a little less than one third of the foundations’ net operating results and 7.8 per cent up on the 1994 figure of 196 billion. The banking foundations’ activities are hampered by their low return on assets. ACRI calculates that the ex-saving bank foundations’ overall ratio of net operating results to assets was 2 per cent in the 1994-95 financial year. This poor performance  though an improvement on 1.43 per cent in the previous financial year  reflects the modest return on holdings of bank shares  dividends from which account for 80 per cent of the result. Thus  the ability of the foundations to fulfil their institutional purposes depends largely on cyclical conditions in the banking industry. It is incumbent on the foundations to seek an optimal return on their capital  in order to preserve its real value and ensure the continuity of their activities. This will require greater asset diversification  a necessary condition for the foundations’ assuming a more fertile  autonomous role in the social sphere. Fostering such a role is the basic objective of the provisions for the revision of the civil-law and tax treatment of the banking foundations in the Government’s recent enabling bill  which are meant to encourage them to dispose of their bank shares. The proposed legislation would provide tax incentives for the operations connected with privatization; unlike earlier proposals  it sets no deadline for the sale of bank shares. The decision to encourage rather than order such disposals and to allow them to be spread out over time appears appropriate. It is compatible with the objective of respecting the decision-making autonomy of the parties involved and improving the profitability of banks so as to enhance the attractiveness of their shares. And it creates scope for the stock market to be able to absorb the shares of the banks  without excess supply depressing the placement price. The foundations will have a better chance to dispose of their bank equity with the necessary gradualness. The incentives for the sale of bank shares will facilitate the reorganization of the banking system and foster an increase in bank size  especially if the sales bring in authentic fresh capital. However  the breadth of the delegation of powers contemplated by the enabling bill and  above all  the diversity of its objectives are such that a well-defined legislative framework is not yet discernible. The parliamentary debate will have to fill in gaps and resolve uncertainties. The proposed establishment of a regulatory authority for non-profit institutions  including the banking foundations. deserves some comment. This authority would be assigned to oversee the legitimacy of the actions of the foundations’ governing bodies  their sound and prudent management  the return on assets  and their effective pursuit of the aims specified in the bylaws. Its powers would also include authorizing transformations and combinations  passing on amendments to bylaws  removing the governing bodies and dissolving foundations in the event of repeated management irregularities  setting a minimum proportion of income (not less than one half) that must be allocated to institutional purposes  and acting in lieu of the governing bodies for individual acts. BIS Review 51/1997 - 9 - Beyond a certain point  it is not easy to reconcile the intensity of the planned administrative controls with the degree of autonomy that recognition of the institutions’ private nature would imply. Nonetheless  the experience of foreign jurisdictions with longer traditions in this field shows that some form of supervision on the foundations and non-profit sector in general remains appropriate  especially as regards entitlement to favourable tax treatment. However  supervision should be calibrated so as to avoid stifling the initiative of the non-profit institutions  draining their capacity to act and ultimately reducing the benefits to civil society. 5. Financing the non-profit and voluntary sector There are four possible sources of funds for the non-profit sector: private donations  government transfers  debt capital and self-financing. Government contributions bulk large in Italy  whereas private donations are marginal. The relationship between the two is specular  and in fact in countries where private donations play a larger role they are encouraged by favourable tax treatment. Banks can help to increase the flow of private donations to non-profit enterprises by offering their customers specially designed financial instruments; for example  the so-called “ethical” funds and accounts that some financial intermediaries have promoted  whose rules require subscribers or depositors to assign all or part of their income from the investment to non- profit institutions. These products can involve financing as well as donations; alongside the assignment of customer earnings or capital gains  there is often an obligation for the intermediary to invest the monies received only in undertakings that conform to certain ethical standards or pursue specific objectives. The organizational and opportunity costs of launching such initiatives are compensated for by the enhanced reputation and standing that the intermediary enjoys among socially aware customers. The specific advantage of banks’ interposition with regard to charitable donations stems from their placement power: branch networks  which give banks an edge in supplying their own financial products and those of others  also put them in a strong position to sell “ethical” products to their customers. Where profit-seeking intermediaries offer customers financial products earmarked to fund the non-profit sector  organizational and accounting controls are necessary to ensure transparency. Other conditions being equal  two factors may handicap non-profit undertakings in raising debt capital. First  the rule prohibiting distribution of profits may strike the prospective lender as likely to erode operating efficiency in the long run. Whereas for commercial enterprises the profit motive is the mainspring of survival and growth  for non-profit institutions there is a problem of ensuring that the altruistic drive does not flag over time. On the other hand  the ban on distributing profits is also a point of strength  since it allows non-profit enterprises to screen and select collaborators  workers and managers who share their altruistic objectives of service. BIS Review 51/1997 - 10 - The second adverse factor is linked to the eventuality of the non-profit undertaking failing to repay the loan. In this event  a bank bringing action for forced recovery would run the risk of appearing to put its own interests before the social  humanitarian or charitable purposes of the distressed undertaking. Financial support can be provided to the non-profit and voluntary sector by intermediaries that exclusively  prevalently or even only occasionally engage in such lending (so-called “ethical” intermediation). The record shows a variety of such experiences in many countries. To cite a few significant examples  Ökobank in Germany  which focuses on environmental and peace issues  had 63 000 customers and 170 billion lire of deposits in 1993; in the Netherlands  Triodos Bank  of the eponymous association for social development and environmental protection  accounts for 2.5 per cent of the country’s total bank deposits; in Switzerland  the banner experience is that of Alternative Bank ABS  which in 1992 had around 106 billion lire of loans outstanding to local non-profit enterprises and associations for third- world development. Other intermediaries concentrate on fostering small business in the third world or in economically depressed areas of the industrialized countries. The best-known example is Grameen Bank of Bangladesh  which lends to farmers in the poorest rural areas. The key to its success is its technique of forming small groups of customers who take part in training workshops that also serve to select the creditworthy. The small loans disbursed to them are gradually scaled up if each member of the group meets the repayment terms. The bank’s high credit quality testifies to the efficacy both of the method used for assessing creditworthiness and of the system of cross-monitoring among members of a group. The high risk that nonetheless characterizes the bank’s activity made it advisable for it to fund its loans primarily with public contributions and the bank’s own resources  part of which was paid in by the beneficiaries of its lending. In the United States  a very interesting case is that of the Illinois Neighborhood Development Corporation  created by non-profit shareholders and licensed to engage in banking since the seventies. The bank initially operated in one of the worst slums of Chicago  the South Shore  and endeavoured to redevelop the area particularly by giving minority groups more access to credit. The programme’s success allowed it to be extended to other rundown  outlying neighbourhoods. Thanks to its skilled and highly-motivated staff  this bank has combined rigorous lending standards with a variety of assistance and promotional services  operating in compliance with the normal banking supervisory requirements. A complete review of the experiences in various countries would also have to include the cases of failure and those demonstrating the difficulty of transplanting successful initiatives to different social and institutional settings. For an “ethical” intermediary actually to achieve comparative advantages in financing the non-profit and voluntary sector  various conditions  not always easily satisfied  have to be met: a highly motivated staff  for one  and savers receptive to the ethical aims pursued and willing to support them over time with deposits. The affinity of ideals between the bank and the borrower must not tempt the former to relax its technical standards of customer selection or neglect to heed the principle of BIS Review 51/1997 - 11 - operating profitability. Specialization in the non-profit and voluntary sector must be compatible with the key principle of the banking system. Operating losses could not only cause the bank to fail but also have adverse repercussions on similar initiatives. The success of such projects essentially depends on devising techniques to limit the credit risk while simultaneously upholding both the “mission” of funding the non-profit sector and the banking industry’s standards of competence and prudence. When a bank is to be established that intends to finance the non-profit sector by taking deposits from the public  the above prudential recommendations become especially cogent. History shows how high the social costs of bank failures can be  and how complex is recourse to the instruments that make up the system’s crisis “safety net”. Modern economic theory accepts the principle that a solid ethical commitment is also economically rational. The propagation of virtuous conduct is a value in and of itself  in that it lends strength and security to economic agents  averting costs and formalities that would otherwise be necessary. This reinforces the ties between ethics and finance  between ethics and business. Ethical and moral principles are increasingly taking root among economic agents  producing closer links between the social dimension and the markets. Modern society is very attentive and sensitive to these values. The demand for ethical conduct is ever broader and stronger. Establishing relations of trust with customers invigorates financial activity. The intermediary must adopt the principle of proper assistance to the customer  of serving the latter’s best interest. In a framework of competition between financial operators  this must be effected in conformity with the intrinsically ethical standard of sound and prudent management. When non-profit institutions are formally organized as enterprises  i.e. when they are based on the principle that revenues must cover costs  they can turn to the banking system and the capital markets for financing to supplement their endowments  private donations and public contributions. In countries where the non-profit sector has grown to significant dimensions  its enterprises compete with commercial firms in the product markets and in the market for financial resources. They obtain funds from commercial intermediaries on the basis of proven solvency and established reputation. In Italian law the formation and the range of business of an intermediary whose vocation is to finance the non-profit sector cannot deviate from the rules governing financial activities in general. These rules respond to needs and interests  including ethical interests  of the first order  which are expressed in the canon of sound and prudent management and the values of stability and efficiency. Only within this framework can financial institutions dedicated to lending to the non-profit sector succeed  enhancing the contribution of finance to the growth of solidarity and voluntary agencies.

Stals  presented to the Harvard Institute for International Development in Boston on 1/5/97.,Mr. Stals examines the role of financial cooperation in the development of the Southern African Development Community Lecture by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank  Dr. C. Stals  presented to the Harvard Institute for International Development in Boston on 1/5/97. 1. Background to the formation of SADC The Southern African Development Community found its origin in 1980 when nine1 countries in Southern Africa decided jointly “to pursue policies aimed at economic liberation and integrated development of our national economies”. One of the main objectives of the association at that stage was to make the economies of these countries less dependent on South Africa -- a country that was then an unwanted ally because of its unacceptable internal political and social policies. After major political and social reforms in South Africa led to the fully democratic election of a Government of National Unity in April 1994  South Africa also joined SADC  to become the eleventh member  after a newly-independent Namibia already joined in 1990. Mauritius was the next country to join SADC  which now has twelve members with a total population of about 136 million people. In August 1992  a revised Treaty for SADC was approved by a Summit Meeting of the Heads of State of the participating countries. Included in the main objectives of the Community are the following economic goals: To achieve development and economic growth  alleviate poverty  enhance the standard and quality of life of the peoples of Southern Africa  and support the socially disadvantaged through regional integration; To promote and maximise productive employment and utilisation of resources of the region  and to achieve sustainable utilisation of natural resources and effective protection of the environment. To achieve its objectives  SADC shall Harmonise political and socio-economic policies and plans of member States. Mobilise the peoples of the region and their institutions to take initiatives to develop economic  social and cultural ties across the region  and to participate fully in the implementation of the programmes and operations of SADC and its institutions. Develop policies aimed at the progressive elimination of obstacles to free movement of capital and labour  goods and services  and of the peoples of the region generally among member States. Promote the development of human resources. Promote the development  transfer and mastery of technology. Improve economic management and performance through regional co-operation. The Treaty provides for other political  social and cultural objectives which are not of direct relevance for the enhancing of financial co-operation in the region. 1 Angola  Botswana  Lesotho  Malawi  Mozambique  Swaziland  Tanzania  Zambia and Zimbabwe. BIS Review 52/1997 2. South Africa’s position within SADC - 2 - The South African economy is by far the most advanced in the region. Although the total South African population of 42 million people accounts for but 31 per cent of the total population of all SADC countries together  the South African economy contributes about 80 per cent of the total gross domestic product of about $170 billion produced in the twelve member states. South Africa also accounts for almost 70 per cent of the combined total exports of $43 billion of the SADC region. South Africa’s dominance is even more pronounced in the financial markets. South Africa is about the only country in the region with well-functioning and independent specialised financial institutions such as banks  long- and short-term insurers  private sector pension funds  mutual funds  participation mortgage bond schemes and mining and industrial finance houses. With a total market capitalisation of about $280 billion  the Johannesburg Stock Exchange dominates the capital markets of the region  and with a daily turnover of about $7 billion  the foreign exchange market in Johannesburg is providing an increasing service for international settlements for a number of other countries of the region. With a turnover of more than $700 billion last year in the South African bond market and a growing market for derivatives  South Africa is in a favourable position to provide sophisticated financial services for the whole SADC region. This dominating position of the South African economy has certain advantages  but at the same time makes harmonious regional co-operation more complex. Some of the other partners in SADC hold an understandable fear that their economic independence will be jeopardised by a too aggressive policy of economic integration of the region. The role that South Africa plays within SADC must therefore be approached with tact and ingenuity. South Africa was given the responsibility for managing and developing the Finance and Investment Protocol2. For this purpose  there is a Council of Ministers of Finance that meet from time to time under the chairmanship of the South African Minister of Finance to give guidance to a programme for closer financial co-operation amongst the participating countries in SADC. Two sub-committees were also established  one a Committee of Treasury Officials  and the other a Committee of Governors of Central Banks and their officials  with clearly defined terms of reference for each one of these Committees. 3. The work and functions of the Committee of Governors of Central Banks When South Africa was given the special task of administering the Finance and Investment Protocol for SADC  the South African Reserve Bank saw in this arrangement a great opportunity for closer co-operation amongst the central banks of the region. In the beginning  however  it proved a major task to get recognition from the political leaders for the need of an independent Committee of Governors of Central Banks. In many of the participating countries the central bank is regarded  and often unfortunately also used  as just an extension of the Treasury Department of the central government. In succeeding to get the approval for the establishment of this Committee of Governors an important seed was sown in each one of these 2 There are a number of other Protocols  co-ordinated by other countries  for example: Inland Fisheries (Malawi)  Marine Fisheries and Resources (Namibia)  Livestock Production and Animal Disease Control (Botswana)  Environment and Land Management (Lesotho)  Energy (Angola)  Mining and Labour and Employment (Zambia)  Tourism (Mauritius)  Industry and Trade (Tanzania)  Food  Agriculture and Natural Resources (Zimbabwe)  Human Resource Development (Swaziland)  and Culture and Information as well as Transport and Communication (Mozambique). BIS Review 52/1997 - 3 - countries for the acceptance of the undeniable advantages  also for the politicians  of an independent central bank. A second major obstacle was overcome when approval was granted for the establishment of a small specialised Secretariat and Research Facility within the South African Reserve Bank to serve the Committee of Governors. This avoided the need for adhering to the cumbersome procedure of communicating within the central banking fraternity through the conduit of the SADC Secretariat  based in Gaborone  the capital of Botswana. The SADC Finance and Investment Sector was formally established only in 1995  and the Committee of Governors held its first meeting on 24 November 1995 in Pretoria. Now  eighteen months later  this Committee can already look back on a number of accomplishments  and can report good progress with a number of projects being pursued in the interest of promoting economic development in the Southern African region. A number of Technical Subcommittees and Working Groups have been formed  consisting mainly of officials of the SADC central banks  to work on specialised projects. 4. The basic philosophy behind financial co-operation in the region Before the Governors’ Committee was established  SADC approached financial co-operation in the region on the basis of proposals made by European advisers  and was based mainly on the model of financial integration in the European Community. The folly of this approach was immediately grasped by the Governors at their first meeting. The divergencies in the stage of economic development of the members of SADC are so vast that there can be no talk at this juncture of a European type of economic integration in Southern Africa. The Governors’ Committee therefore had to design its own model for sensible financial co-operation in the region. In drafting its own mission statement  the Committee designed a model for financial co-operation that was described as a “bottom-up” approach. This approach is based on building financial co-operation by laying an appropriate foundation in the form of an effective institutional framework for the financial system in each country. More grandiose schemes for the harmonisation or integration of macroeconomic monetary polices can be considered once central banks  private banking sectors and financial markets have been established and are functioning effectively in most of the participating countries. A second challenge that had to be faced was the diverse roles and functions assigned by their Governments to the various central banks in the region. In finding an answer to the question of what contribution central banks can make towards the achievement of the goals of SADC  a consensus had to be found on what the task of the central banks should be in promoting optimum economic development and growth. There may not yet be full agreement on this daunting question  but the majority view now favours the contemporary approach of the more advanced economies that the central bank’s responsibilities should be restricted to the creation and maintenance of a stable financial environment that will be conducive for sustainable economic growth. Central banks must protect the value of the currency. This is gospel  not only in more industrialised  but also in developing and emerging economies. Overall financial stability may not be a guarantee for  but certainly is a precondition for  sustainable economic growth. 5. The framework for financial co-operation within SADC In terms of the bottom-up approach  the Committee of Governors kicked-off its work programme by exchanging views on the nature  structure and functions of each central BIS Review 52/1997 - 4 - bank in the region. In many developing countries  central banks  acting as extensions of Government Finance Departments  are often directly involved in normal commercial and development banking  and in many other macroeconomic activities such as export promotion  social upliftment programmes  and financing of government budgetary shortfalls. This  of course  often creates a conflict with the prime objective of central banking  and that is to protect the value of the currency. The powers of the central bank in such countries must first be reduced to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy. In the second phase of its deliberations  the Committee of Governors is concentrating on the quantity and quality of private banking in the region. The establishment of sound and well-managed privately-owned banking institutions must be encouraged to provide financial services in a competitive environment. The two tiers of banking  that is central banking and private banking  must be separated on a clearly-defined basis. In the third phase of financial co-ordination  the central bank Governors are working together in a joint effort to develop compatible and inter-linkable national payments  clearing and settlement systems for financial transactions. Eventually  the national systems must be linked to each other to provide for more effective cross-border settlement of inter-regional financial transactions. This project requires some co-operation in the development of compatible electronic data processing and technology systems in the twelve participating central banks. In a fourth phase  more attention will be focused on the development of financial markets in the region. A lot of research work must be done on the introduction of appropriate legal institutional frameworks  the introduction of financial instruments and the improvement of technological systems and human resource skills in the foreign exchange  money and capital markets. Some rationalisation in the use of the existing markets to the advantage of the whole region will be necessary. Only then will it become possible to consider greater harmonisation and even integration of macroeconomic financial policies such as interest and exchange rate policies  the management of bank liquidity and credit extension on a regional basis  and operations by central banks in a more integrated financial market environment. 6. The practical implementation of the programme for financial co-operation The SADC Committee of Governors is determined gradually to implement its plan for greater financial co-operation over the next few years in the whole region. On the African Continent  many ambitious plans for economic co-operation exist on paper  but are never executed. The Governors’ Committee has already embarked on the implementation stage  and is now actively involved in a number of the ground-work projects: 1. It has become necessary for the twelve Governors to have a better understanding of the regional economic environment within which they operate. For this purpose the Secretariat of the Governors’ Committee established a statistical data base for essential economic time series from the twelve countries in the computer capacity of the South African Reserve Bank. It is the intention to connect all the central banks in due course with real- time on-line linkages to the data base. 2. To enable Governors to learn from the experiences of each other  a data bank with information on issues such as legislation  relationships with Governments  functions and responsibilities  management  policy objectives  procedures and instruments of monetary policy  BIS Review 52/1997 - 5 - and administrative structures for each central bank  has been compiled and is now available to all the Governors. 3. Programmes are encouraged for the establishment of efficient and well- managed privately-owned banking institutions in all SADC countries. Assistance is being provided for the revision of the banking laws in some countries  and central banks are encouraged where necessary to withdraw themselves from private sector banking activity. 4. The South African Reserve Bank is playing a leading role in the development of the quality of  and capacity for  proper bank regulation and supervision. Some harmonisation is encouraged on policies such as bank licensing  minimum financial prudential requirements  and regular auditing of banking institutions. A joint effort is also being made to take the necessary action against illegal banking activities in the region  such as money laundering and pyramid schemes. 5. There is a great need for training and the development of skills in central banking in the region. The South African Reserve Bank has introduced a specialised Training Institute for Central Banking  and is now providing specialised courses in central banking and financial management for its own staff and officials of other central banks in the SADC region. The central banks of the region also formed an East and Southern Africa Banking Supervisors Group (ESAF) to standardise bank regulation and supervision in the region. ESAF is providing specialised courses for the development of the financial regulatory capacity in the region. There is also a more ambitious training programme provided through the Macroeconomic and Financial Management Institute (MEFMI). A number of Southern African countries  but not all members of SADC  participate in this venture. With its headquarters in Harare  MEFMI’s operational mandate covers two broad areas: “(i) In-depth capacity building  involving training  institutional development  networking and technical support  to strengthen countries’ ability to manage their debt and external reserves;” and “(ii) a training programme for public officials with duties relating to macroeconomic and financial management  providing courses in a wide range of high-priority fields.” MEFMI has the support of a number of international institutions  such as the World Bank  and has the potential to make an important contribution to the development of desperately needed skills for the management of the economic transformation of African countries. 6. The removal of remaining exchange controls in the region is a major priority of the Governors’ Committee. Arrangements have been introduced for the unrestricted repatriation of notes and coin used in participating countries amongst the members of SADC  and the movement towards an unrestricted flow of capital in the region is being promoted. South Africa is lifting its remaining exchange controls in respect of SADC countries faster than for the rest of the world. Two members  namely Zambia and Mauritius  have already removed all exchange controls in their countries. 7. Reference has already been made to the work that is being done in the area of electronic data processing and the development of a cross-border network for financial clearing  payment and settlement transactions. International assistance is now sought (through the World BIS Review 52/1997 - 6 - Bank) for the development of the national payment and clearing systems in the less-developed economies of the region. 7. The road ahead There is growing enthusiasm in Southern Africa for a regional approach to economic development issues. There are  unfortunately  more than one initiative for multi- national regional economic co-operation arrangements in Sub-Saharan Africa  initiatives that often compete with each other. In Southern Africa itself  the SADC and COMESA (the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa)  groupings provide many overlapping services and some countries belong to both organisations  and others to only one of the two. The time has come for Governments in the region to consider a merger of the two competing regional groupings in a more viable single regional association. Both SADC and COMESA have their own Secretariats with a strong bureaucracy that often inhibits initiatives because of unnecessary rigid procedural requirements. In the case of the Committee of Governors of SADC  we often live in sin because of non-compliance with the prescribed procedures of the SADC Secretariat. Forgiveness  however  can easily be extorted  as long as progress and successes can be claimed. There is among some governments still a strong suspicion of the motives behind closer economic co-operation in the region. The question arises whether it is perhaps not a real danger that the powerful South African economy will exploit the smaller economies for its own advantage: South Africa has to act with great discretion in performing its role in the programme. South Africa obviously has a vested interest in the economic development of the region as a whole. Internally  South Africa still has many serious economic problems that must be resolved to improve the living conditions of its own people. Unemployment is high  many communities live in great poverty  and there is a relatively wide spread between high and low incomes earned in the country. Many people therefore believe that South Africa should concentrate all its resources on the development of its own economy. There is  however  a basic fallacy in this approach. Whenever South Africa makes some progress in solving its own economic problems without a parallel development in other countries in the region  the unemployed from the other countries get sucked into the South African system. If South Africa is not prepared to accept more exports from other African countries and does not want to allow part of the South African savings to be invested in these countries  the country will have to absorb great numbers of unemployed people from the rest of the region. The region of SADC is gradually becoming an attractive place for foreign investors. Its potential for economic development is vast  and undeveloped human resources and the exploding demand for goods and services emanating from people who are now being absorbed for the first time in a real market economy  must lure many multi-national institutions to the Southern Africa region. It depends on us how attractive we can make our own region for the outside world as a place for long-term  durable  and productive investment. BIS Review 52/1997

Rangarajan  at the Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry at Chennai on 19/4/97.,Mr. Rangarajan elucidates the monetary and credit policy of the Reserve Bank of India for the first half of the 1997-98 financial year Address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India  Mr. C. Rangarajan  at the Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry at Chennai on 19/4/97. I would like to take this opportunity given to me to speak to you this afternoon to focus on the monetary and credit policy for the first half of 1997-98 which was announced a few days ago. It may be useful at the outset to review the major developments during 1996-97. 2. The growth rate of broad money (M3) in 1996-97 was 15.6 per cent which was within the targetted band of 15.5 - 16.0 per cent. The real GDP is expected to have grown by 6.8 per cent. The inflation rate as measured by the change in the Wholesale Price Index was 7.3 per cent on a point-to-point basis. A notable feature of 1996-97 was that the money and foreign exchange markets were generally calm in contrast with the turbulence witnessed in these markets in the previous year. A strong growth in bank deposits  coupled with substantial reduction in cash reserve requirements resulted in abundant liquidity in the system. However  the off-take of bank credit was subdued. Short-term money market rates have moved down as a result of the easy liquidity conditions. Lending rates are known for their stickiness and remained at high levels during the first half of 1996-97 but softened later. There has been a strong accretion to the foreign exchange reserves. The slow growth in non-food bank credit  the persistence of relatively high lending rates despite comfortable liquidity in the banking system and the acceleration of inflow of funds from abroad call for active monetary and exchange rate management by the Reserve Bank. 3. While the overall growth momentum has been sustained in 1996-97  divergent trends were observed in various sectors with agricultural output showing an impressive recovery and industrial growth slowing down. Even within the industrial sector  the decline in growth rates in mining and electricity sectors was sharp. The inflation rate at 7.3 per cent was a matter of concern. While manufacturing prices rose only by 5.1 per cent  primary articles recorded an increase of 8.3 per cent. During 1996-97  procurement of foodgrains was low  while the off-take was high. With the result  buffer stocks of foodgrains fell from 23.3 million tonnes at the end of March 1996 to 18.6 million tonnes at the end of January 1997. The decline in wheat stocks was sharper. 4. The target for expansion in M3 during 1996-97 was set at 15.5 - 16.0 per cent. During the financial year 1996-97  M3 increased by 15.6 per cent as compared with 13.7 per cent in 1995-96. Aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks showed a strong growth of Rs.697.8 billion (16.1 per cent) during 1996-97 as compared with a modest increase of Rs.469.6 billion (12.1 per cent) during 1995-96. However  the increase in non-food credit of scheduled commercial banks by Rs.247.1 billion (10.1 per cent) during 1996-97 was substantially lower than that of Rs.449.4 billion (22.5 per cent) during 1995-96. The depressed capital markets seemed to have played a role inasmuch as there has to be some balance between debt and equity. Equity raised by the corporates was significantly lower in 1996-97 than in 1995-96. Investments by banks in bonds/debentures/shares of public sector undertakings and private corporate sector and commercial paper increased by Rs.65.8 billion in 1996-97 as compared with a decline of Rs.1.62 billion in the previous year. Thus  the total resource flow from banks to the commercial sector inclusive of loans and advances as well as investments in bonds/debentures/shares amounted to Rs.312.9 billion as against Rs.447.7 billion in 1995-96. Investments by scheduled commercial banks in Government securities showed a quantum jump with an increase of Rs.268.6 billion during 1996-97 as compared with the increase of Rs.145.4 billion during 1995-96. BIS Review 52/1997 - 2 - 5. One of the major objectives of financial sector reform has been to eliminate financial repression which is inherent in an administered interest rate structure and significant strides have been made in this direction. This process of change which began in late 1980s has not been abrupt but gradual. During this period  considerable degree of freedom has been given to banks to determine both deposit and lending rates. Following moderation in the inflation rates in 1995-96 and 1996-97 and the reductions in cash reserve ratio  there has been a conspicuous reduction in both deposit rates and lending rates of banks as also spreads over the prime lending rates (PLR). In July 1996  some public sector banks reduced their PLR by 0.5 percentage point. However  as a number of banks were charging lending rates far higher than PLR  banks were directed in the monetary policy announcement of October 1996 that along with the announcement of their PLR  they should  with the approval of their respective Boards  also announce the maximum spread over the PLR for all advances other than consumer credit. The public sector banks have since reduced their PLR further from 16.5 per cent in March 1996 to 14.0 - 15.5 per cent by March 1997 and spreads in the rate of 2.5 - 4.0 percentage points were announced. During 1996-97  many banks had also brought down interest rates on term deposits by 1 to 2 percentage points on the shorter end of their maturity spectrum with a view to reducing the average cost of deposits. 6. Reflecting the easy liquidity conditions during 1996-97  there has been a significant softening of money market interest rates. At the short end of the market  the rates have come down sharply and have ruled generally low as compared with the levels prevailing in 1995-96. The typical call money rates ruled low in the range of 2.00 - 5 per cent in the recent period. The rate on 91-day Treasury Bills came down from 12.97 per cent at the beginning of April 1996 to 7.96 per cent in March 1997. Similarly  the rate on 364 day Treasury Bills declined from 13.12 per cent in April 1996 to 10.10 per cent in March 1997. The typical rates of discount on Certificates of Deposits (CDs) and Commercial Paper (CP) have also declined sharply since end-March 1996. There was also some softening of coupon rates on long-term Government bonds. 7. The stance of monetary policy in 1997-98 would be to achieve the twin objectives of maintaining reasonable price stability and ensuring availability of adequate bank credit to support the growth of the real sector. The economy is still subject to inflationary pressures. There is need for continued caution on the price front and this would require a moderation in monetary expansion consistent with the expected real growth. There is also the need for developing the Bank Rate as reference rate to signal policy stance of the Reserve Bank. This would require rationalisation of the interest rate structure and linking of interest rates to the Bank Rate. There is an urgency to step up the flow of bank credit. This would need streamlining and improving credit delivery system by giving greater freedom to banks. Besides  banks must endeavour to bring down the interest rates by reducing the spreads. The money  foreign exchange and government securities markets need to be further developed and integrated. 8. In regulating money supply growth in the coming year  the Reserve Bank will have to reckon with the impact of capital inflows. If capital inflows remain strong  the Reserve Bank must take care to see that the resultant reserve money expansion after taking into account the net RBI credit to the Central Government does not exceed a level that is consistent with the expansion in money supply justified by the growth of the real sector. 9. Given the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 6.0 - 7.0 per cent  monetary policy would seek to maintain the expansion in M3 in the range of 15.0 - 15.5 per cent to keep the inflation rate at around 6 per cent in 1997-98. The projected increase in money supply may be reviewed and revised depending upon macro-economic developments. On the BIS Review 52/1997 - 3 - basis of the projected increase in M3  the working estimate of the growth of aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks is placed at Rs.800 billion (16.0 per cent). The expansion in net scheduled commercial bank credit including such investments as in bonds/debentures/shares of Public Sector Units (PSUs) and private corporate sector  is envisaged to be of the order of 20.0 - 21.0 per cent. The policy measures which are being announced have been so framed that banks will have adequate resources to meet all the genuine productive requirements of the economy. 10. Broadly speaking  the current monetary and credit policy seeks to achieve four objectives. The various measures announced as part of the policy can be brought under these four objectives. The first objective of course is to maintain a reasonable degree of price stability and moderate inflationary pressures in the system by regulating money supply. As indicated earlier  the target rate of growth of M3 is set in the range of 15 - 15.5 per cent. With a real rate of growth between 6 and 7 per cent  this would enable us to keep the inflation rate around 6 per cent. 11. The second objective is to expand the lendable resources of banks and also to bring about a reduction in the lending rates. The Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) was lowered at different points of time during the previous year. The full impact of the reductions in the CRR effected last year will be seen in the current year. The CRR on inter-bank liabilities has been withdrawn as part of the policy. Apart from the impact this will have on the creation of an appropriate term deposit market  this will release about Rs.9500 million of lendable resources to banks. We have also introduced a general refinance facility which will be available to banks and this facility will be equivalent to one per cent of the demand and time liabilities of banks. All of these measures will have the impact of expanding the lendable resources of banks. The bank rate has been reduced from 12 per cent to 11 per cent to signal a reduction in the interest rate. We want the bank rate to emerge as an effective signal rate as well as a reference rate. To coincide with the reduction in bank rate  the term deposit rate for maturity of 30 days and upto one year has been reduced by one percentage point. The same rate has been made applicable to rates on term deposits of Non-Resident (External) Rupee Deposit accounts of maturity of over six months and upto one year. On Foreign Currency Non Resident Accounts (Banks) deposits  banks are free to determine interest rates subject to a ceiling prescribed by the RBI from time to time. Thus the various measures announced will have the effect of expanding the lendable resources of banks on the one hand and bringing about on the other a reduction in the deposit rates and consequently lending rates. 12. Responding to the policy announcement  a number of banks in the public sector banks have already reduced their PLR by 50-100 basis points to take it to 14 per cent. Needless to say the only enduring way to bring about a reduction in the interest rate is by keeping the inflation rate low and breaking inflationary expectations. 13. The third objective relates to the revamping of the credit delivery system which has become necessary for accelerating the credit flow from the banking system. A number of measures announced fall in this category. I would like to list the most important among them. The mandatory consortium requirements for credit limits of Rs.500 million and more has been dispensed with. Banks and their customers can now enter into a variety of arrangements including syndication subject of course to the exposure limits. Banks have been given full freedom to evolve their own methods of assessing the working capital requirements of borrowers. This should result in quicker decision making and speedier flow of funds from banks to their borrowers. The loan component of the working capital limits is being gradually enhanced. However  banks are now free to fix the maturity period of the loans on their own. The limits set on the extent of bank credit that can be made available to Non-Banking Financial BIS Review 52/1997 - 4 - Companies (NBFCs) has been removed. This  however  applies only to NBFCs which have complied with the requirements of registration  credit rating and prudential norms. Banks hitherto have been permitted to invest 5 per cent of their incremental deposits of the previous year in shares and debentures. Debentures are now excluded from this limit so that this limit would be available exclusively for shares of corporates including PSUs. In the context of the present condition of the capital market  banks have been allowed to extend loans to corporates against shares held by them to enable such corporates to meet the promoters' contribution to the equity of new companies in anticipation of raising resources. The credit delivery system is thus sought to be improved. 14. The fourth objective is the improvement in the functioning of the various markets - money market  government securities market and the foreign exchange market. The important measures that relate to the money market are: removal of cash reserve ratio on the inter-bank liabilities; reduction in the minimum period of maturity for the commercial paper to 30 days; reduction in the minimum size of certificates of deposit and improved access to cash surplus entities through primary dealers. The Government securities market will benefit by the enlargement of instruments eligible for Repo transactions  allowing the entry of non-bank entities who are holders of SGL accounts with the Reserve Bank to enter into reverse Repo transactions and the introduction of Treasury Bills of varying maturities. In order to deepen and widen the foreign exchange market  certain measures have been taken. These include permission to book forward contracts on the basis of declaration of exposure  permission to Authorised Dealers to borrow upto US$ 10 million from abroad as well as to invest up to US$ 10 million abroad and permission given to Authorised Dealers to engage in Forex-Rupee current swap without the prior approval of RBI. The various measures taken in the area of market improvement will lead not only to the efficient functioning of the individual markets but also bring about a greater integration among them. 15. In order to facilitate greater flow of credit to agriculture  the share capital of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) as well as the General Line of Credit granted to NABARD by RBI have been increased. The simplified procedure of assessing the working capital needs on the basis of 20 per cent of the projected turn over is being extended to borrowers having working capital limits up to Rs.20 million as against Rs.10 million earlier. This should benefit a large number of Small Scale Industrial Units. 16. The measures announced cover a wide range and touch almost every part of the financial system. Some of the measures are directed towards improving the functioning of the various markets and bringing about a greater integration among them  which should reduce the volatility of the rates in these markets. These measures are in the nature of institutional and structural reforms. The improvements in the credit delivery system should remove the ‘chokes’ in the flow of credit. 17. All in all  the measures announced should have the effect of accelerating economic growth  keeping inflationary pressures under control and improving the flow of credit from the banking system to the various segments of the Indian economy.

Macfarlane  to the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce in Melbourne on 15/5/97.,Mr. Macfarlane reviews monetary policy  growth and unemployment in Australia Talk by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia  Mr. I.J. Macfarlane  to the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce in Melbourne on 15/5/97. It is a pleasure to be here in Melbourne  and to be speaking to the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce. I was very pleased to be invited to address this distinguished group so soon after I was appointed. If at the end of this address  you feel that I have still left some important questions unanswered  my suggestion is that your next guest be my opposite number from Israel. Jacob Frenkel  the Governor of the Bank of Israel  is a distinguished economist  but a very busy man. My invitations to him to visit Australia have so far been unsuccessful - perhaps this Chamber can swing the balance. I want to take this opportunity today to talk about the economy  monetary policy  and some aspects of unemployment. I propose to do this by looking over a longer period than normal. Most economic commentary concentrates on very current events and focuses on the latest monthly or quarterly economic statistics. This is an inevitable result of the news-gathering process and the need for financial markets to reassess after each new piece of information. In this environment  the outlook for the year ahead is considered a long time. In my view  even that is too short - for monetary policy purposes  we should be looking at a period as long as an economic expansion. That may not be a lot of immediate help to most people because they would be unsure of what time span was encompassed by an economic expansion. As a point of reference  the last two expansions have lasted for about six-and-a-half years  but I think we can do a lot better on this occasion. Lengthening the expansion The current expansion in Australia has been going on for about 5½ years  which is similar to the United States  the United Kingdom and New Zealand  and a fair bit longer than for countries in continental Europe or Japan. Table 1 shows that over that period we have grown at an annual rate of 3½ per cent and had inflation of 2½ per cent. Our growth rate has been higher than nearly all OECD countries  although not as strong as for the countries of east Asia. Our inflation rate is also very good and close to the average for OECD countries. The results are pretty good by international standards  particularly since there should be a lot more expansion still to come. The main reason that I think we still have a lot more to come is that this has been a low-inflation expansion and remains so. An important reason why inflation has remained low is that monetary policy has been determined to keep it low this time. The centrepiece of our monetary policy approach is a medium-term inflation target endorsed both by the Government and the Reserve Bank. It was also endorsed by the Treasurer in the previous Government and was incorporated into the Accord Mark VIII agreed in June 1995. It is not just something we dreamt up at the Reserve Bank; it has enjoyed wide bipartisan support. And recently  the Industrial Relations Commission made it clear that they felt their own decision had to take note of this framework. The statement agreed between the Treasurer and myself at the time of my appointment saw low inflation as a requirement for sustained growth  which is another part of the Bank’s Charter. Containing inflation is not an end in itself; it is one of the pre-conditions for sustained growth. It is not the only one  but it is obviously the one for which central banks have to accept most responsibility. BIS Review 53/1997 - 2 - Table 1: GDP Growth and Inflation GDPa Consumer Pricesa Ireland Norway Australia New Zealand United States Canada Denmark Netherlands United Kingdom Finland Germany Japan Spain Belgium France Italy Sweden Switzerland 6.1 3.8 3.6 3.6 2.7 2.2 2.2 2.2 2.2 1.6 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.3 1.0 1.0 -0.1 2.4 2.3 2.3 1.7 3.1 1.7 2.0 2.9 3.0 1.9 3.1 0.8 4.8 1.9 1.9 4.3 2.1 2.3 (a) Average annual rate since June 1991 Inflation and growth We do attract criticism  however  from people who think that because we have an inflation target it means we are not interested in economic growth. This is not true - as I have pointed out on a number of occasions. In fact  the reverse is true: we are interested in sustaining a good inflation performance because we are interested in growth. Let me make two points I have made before: (a) The other way of looking at an inflation target is to say that the aim is to grow as fast as possible consistent with maintaining low inflation  but no faster. We say no faster because post-war history has taught us that allowing inflation to rise actually harms growth prospects in the longer term. Strong growth and long expansions have always gone hand-in-hand with low inflation. Weaker growth and short expansions have occurred in the high-inflation era  particularly the 1970s but also in some parts of the 1980s. This “no faster” idea does not mean that we will panic at unexpectedly strong growth over a short period. It does mean we intend to avoid a “full steam ahead and damn the torpedoes” approach to policy. (b) As I said at the start of the talk  we want a long expansion this time. We do not want the expansion to last only six-and-a-half years and be followed by a recession. The damage  particularly to unemployment  occurs during recessions. The net rise in unemployment in Australia over the past 25 years has not been due to prolonged periods of weak economic growth; it has been concentrated into three relatively short periods of recession (see Diagram 1). The best thing monetary policy can do to improve our BIS Review 53/1997 - 3 - employment prospects is to prolong the expansion and delay and reduce the size of any subsequent recession. On occasion  that means easing the growth rates back a bit to counter inflationary pressures early  as an alternative to more vigorous application of the brakes when inflation has built more momentum. Diagram 1 Unemployment Rate 9 9 6 6 3 3 0 0 9 9 6 6 3 3 1973 1977 1981 1985 1989 1993 0 0 1997 Ideally  we should try to eliminate the business cycle (and recessions) altogether  but that would be too utopian an aspiration. The business cycle has been declared dead before  only to re-assert itself. I do believe  however  that if inflation is kept under control  this expansion will be a lot longer than its predecessors and any subsequent downturn kept milder than in the past. Less pressure would be placed on monetary policy in a late-cycle situation if the aim were only to slow the economy  than if it were necessary both to slow the economy and to reduce an entrenched inflation  as has been the case in the past. Speed limits Some people would characterise our approach to monetary policy as incorporating “a speed limit”. In a very broad sense this is true. We do not want the economy to grow so fast that it pushes up wage and price inflation to unacceptable rates. I have already explained the reason for that. However  the concept of a “speed limit” is unhelpful if we try to use it mechanistically. It has been claimed that the Reserve Bank has a rule that the economy cannot be allowed to grow faster than 3½ per cent. I have seen this claim on a number of occasions  but can assure you that it is not true. I do not know where it came from; perhaps from observing historical growth rates  or perhaps from some misinterpretation of things that the Bank has said on occasion. The figure of 3½ per cent is also sometimes regarded as the Government’s target. Again  I do not know where this claim came from  but it is probably derived from the fact that government projections  such as those underlying the Budget forward estimates  often assume average growth rates like this  particularly for the out-years of multi-year projections. These assumptions should be seen as what they are - an attempt to base government planning on BIS Review 53/1997 - 4 - prudent  conservative assumptions rather than wishful thinking - not as iron-clad limits to growth or short-term “targets”. There are a number of reasons why it does not make sense to specify a particular number as the “speed limit” for the coming year. Among those reasons are the following: (a) Even if we have a clear idea of a long-term average rate of growth  an economy can clearly grow faster than that when it is taking up excess capacity. This would be the case if it was coming off a year when growth was a bit on the soft side (as was 1996  for example) and where inflation was very well contained. (b) It is not possible to “fine-tune” an economy to grow at the rate you want over the space of one year. Neither forecasting accuracy  nor the monetary policy process  permits that degree of accuracy. Even with very good economic policy  the economy will grow faster than average half the time and slower the other half. (c) Just because the economy averaged a particular figure in the past  it does not mean that this average is the one we should project into the future when thinking about potential growth. There is some evidence  as is shown in our Semi-Annual Statement on Monetary Policy  that productivity growth has increased  and hence it is possible that potential growth may have risen. On the other hand  population and labour force growth may well be slower than in the past and this would work in the opposite direction. I hope I have made it clear that we do not regard economic growth as excessive because it has breached a particular figure - say  3½ per cent. We would regard it as excessive if it is pushing up wages and prices in a way which would cause our medium-term target to be exceeded. Obviously  the faster is growth in any particular period  all other things equal  the higher the risk of that problem becomes. But we do not have  and it is not sensible to have  a doctrinaire view of particular growth thresholds which  if breached  are assumed to generate problems. The policy process is rather more pragmatic than that  and proceeds by the rather simple technique of examining the evidence for what it says about inflation pressures in the period ahead. That  to repeat  is the test: not whether a growth rate matches or exceeds a particular pre-determined figure  but whether low inflation performance is being maintained over time. At any point in time we are constantly monitoring wages and prices and making an assessment of the outlook over the next year or so. If we get good news and our assessment is for lower growth in wages and prices  we can  other things equal  let the economy run faster. This may be done by reducing interest rates or  depending on the circumstances  refraining from raising them. If on the other hand we are getting bad news  we may have to tighten or forego an easing. This idea is not all that novel. It is very similar to the way the monetary policy process is described in the United States. Our newspapers are full of the latest speculation about what Alan Greenspan - the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board - is going to do this month  next month and thereafter. The big story of 1996 in the United States was that nearly everyone expected monetary policy to be tightened. The US economy was already at full capacity and still growing strongly  people expected that inflationary pressures would soon emerge  and the Fed would have to tighten. On three occasions - July  September and December - the markets were convinced it was going to happen  but on each occasion the Fed was able to sit on its hands. Why was it possible to delay the tightening for nearly a year? It was not because the economy BIS Review 53/1997 - 5 - weakened; in fact  it grew faster than initially anyone had forecast  expanding by over 3 per cent in 1996  well above previous forecasts and economists’ estimates of its long-run potential growth rate. It was because the Fed continued to receive constant feedback from the economy indicating that rises in prices and wages remained moderate. None of this means that the US economy is somehow entirely freed from all the constraints it has experienced in the past; only that  to date  inflation performance has been a bit better than they expected. To that extent  the Fed has been able to allow the growth to run just a little longer. No-one would be more pleased than the Reserve Bank to see a similar outcome for the Australian economy over the next 12 or 18 months - that is  continuing good news on wages and prices  allowing us to grow faster for longer. It was an assessment of improving prospects for inflation  and the associated scope for additional growth  that lay behind the three easings in the second half of 1996. We would like to have seen that pattern of news continued  but the latest data on wages seems to have been a setback to that expectation. Other views Of course  not everyone agrees with this approach. There are those who think a much higher figure for growth is achievable and should be pursued. Their approach would be to nominate a figure - I have seen 5 per cent mentioned - and expect the Reserve Bank to adjust monetary policy to achieve it in the long run (not just for one year). The trouble with this approach is that it amounts to a gamble with rather poor odds. While we do not wish to take too strong a view on what is “too much” in any particular short period  we need to keep a reasonably sober perspective on what is likely to be feasible over the long run. A growth rate of 5 per cent  for example  is so far above our historical performance that unless you can specify how improvements on the supply side of the economy have lifted the potential growth rate dramatically  it cannot be taken seriously. Now there may well be some significant benefits coming through on the supply side as a result of structural changes and micro-economic reform. For example  reductions in tariffs and increased competition within the domestic market are two that spring to mind. We may also be getting something out of increased flexibility in some parts of the workforce  though the jury is still out at present on exactly how far that process has brought us. But even though there is some tentative evidence of higher productivity  I think we have still got a lot further to go before we could be confident that supply-side reforms have significantly lifted our potential growth rate. More importantly  our current monetary policy procedures  consistently applied  should guide us to the right answer without having to take such a gamble. If the economy really is capable of much faster non-inflationary growth than in the past  constant evaluation of the feedback we receive from the data should enable us to detect this change. If we receive a flow of information pointing to lower pressures on wages and prices  for example  we can let the economy run faster than earlier relationships might have suggested  as in the Greenspan example. This may not satisfy those with a liking for a punt  because the feedback process takes longer. But it carries less risk of miscalculation. Longer-term aspects of unemployment So far  we have been talking about monetary policy in relation to the business cycle. I have argued that we should try to maintain the economy in a position of growth for as long a time as possible. This is best achieved by seeking to remain free of major imbalances  and addressing those which do emerge as quickly as possible. BIS Review 53/1997 - 6 - But there is a bigger dimension to Australia’s unemployment problem than managing the business cycle. It becomes clear from a consideration of the longer-term history both of our own economy and those of other countries. What I want to suggest is that a common perception that if we could only grow faster  unemployment would go away  is missing an important part of the story. Consider the data in Table 2  which is for the same group of countries as shown earlier in Table 1. The table sets out the average growth rate per capita in these countries and their unemployment performance. This latter concept is measured by seeing how much higher their current unemployment rate is than it was in the first half of the 1960s. There is one country where the unemployment rate is now lower  namely the United States. At the other end of the spectrum  we have the large European countries where the unemployment rate is enormously higher than it was in the 1960s. We are somewhere in the middle - better than the large Europeans  but not as good as the United States  the United Kingdom or New Zealand. We can then pose the question: have the Europeans suffered because their growth rates were inferior to the United States? Is that the reason for their higher unemployment rates? The answer seems to be no  because column 1 shows that most of the major European countries had quite respectable growth rates over this period; for example  Germany  France  Italy and Spain all grew faster than the United States (or the United Kingdom  New Zealand or us). Their performance on unemployment has been dismal  not because of their growth performance  but despite it. Diagram 2 shows that  over this relatively long period  there is no systematic relationship between the growth of the economy and the change in the unemployment rate (if there was  the dots would be clustered around a downward sloping line). Table 2: Growth Rate and Change in Unemployment GDP per capita Average Growth 1960-1996 Unemployment Rate Early 1960s Latest Difference United States Norway Japan Canada United Kingdom Switzerland Netherlands New Zealand Denmark Australia Ireland Sweden Italy France Germany Belgium Finland Spain BIS Review 53/1997 2.1 3.2 4.5 2.3 2.0 1.5 2.3 1.2 2.3 2.2 3.7 2.0 3.0 2.6 2.4 2.7 2.7 3.4 5.7 1.7 1.3 6.0 1.7 0.0 0.5 0.1 1.5 2.0 5.0 1.6 3.5 1.4 0.7 2.2 1.4 2.3 4.9 3.5 3.2 9.6 6.1 5.6 6.2 6.4 8.0 8.7 11.7 8.4 12.3 12.8 11.2 12.9 15.1 21.7 -0.8 1.8 1.9 3.6 4.4 5.6 5.7 6.3 6.5 6.7 6.7 6.8 8.8 11.5 10.5 10.7 13.7 19.4 - 7 - There are  no doubt  many aspects to this story  which I cannot go into here. But it seems reasonably apparent that while good economic growth is a very important part of reducing unemployment  growth alone will not be the whole answer. If it was  Europe’s unemployment rates would be much more like that of the United States. There is something in the European system which means that growth is not converted into jobs in the same way as it is in the United States. People who have spent a great deal of time studying these issues have come to the conclusion that the highly regulated labour markets that form part of the continental European world can often work against the interests of job creation. Such labour markets usually have an institutional framework which promotes job security  imposes relatively strict minimum wages and conditions  provides easily accessible sickness and unemployment benefits  and increases trade union involvement in decisions. Diagram 2 Growth and Unemployment in OECD Countries 15 10 5 0 2 3 4 -5 0 1 GDP per capita (average annual growth  1960 to 1996) As a result  these systems tend to be good at protecting the interests of those in work - the insiders  but are often not helpful to the longer-term interests of the outsiders - those looking for work. Employers are less keen to offer new jobs because of the higher costs and the difficulty of reversing the decision if it becomes necessary. The unemployed  while having a more generous safety-net than under a US-type system  are less likely to be offered a job and less likely to look for one. A high proportion of long-term unemployed is a feature of continental European countries. Ironically  it seems that measures designed to promote security of employment may well have the effect of limiting the extent of employment. I think we know that there are elements of this story in our own case too. It is not as though the Australian economy has suffered particularly bad growth in the last twenty years. It grew more slowly than in the 1960s  but everyone suffered that slowdown. We have had several periods of reasonably solid growth by international standards. On each occasion  we have  unfortunately  found the limits to growth. But we still have high unemployment by the BIS Review 53/1997 - 8 - standards of the United States  New Zealand and the United Kingdom and  more importantly  by the standards of what we ourselves regard as acceptable. Why does our unemployment performance have rather more in common with the continental European countries than we would like? Is it perhaps because our labour market institutions also have much in common? Our labour market was never as deregulated as the United States and we have not gone through recent deregulations to the same extent as have the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Last year the Government enacted some changes to increase flexibility through the Workplace Relations Act. These changes  simplifying and streamlining arrangements and making it easier to strike bargains  seem to be a move in the right direction. It is too early to judge how substantial the beneficial effects of these changes will be (and it will of course depend on how much use the parties choose to make of the flexibility on offer). On the surface  these reforms were less ambitious than those in the United Kingdom or New Zealand. Changes to labour market arrangements are  of course  politically difficult. One reason is that the insiders have to give something up. Job security is clearly reduced  and some hard-won entitlements may have to be relinquished. More flexibility in wage setting almost certainly entails a wider dispersion of wage rates - that is more wage inequality - and reform of unemployment benefits would place tougher conditions on the unemployed. It is understandable that many people are unwilling to make these changes and why they foresee such worrying phenomena as the “working poor”. Most people in our society  in other words  see general fairness as a relevant criterion in choosing policy outcomes. As a result  we would not want to go completely down the US route  with such extreme differences in incomes between senior executives of companies and the shop floor. But we do not have to go as far as the United States - there is a happy medium in this  as in most things. All I am suggesting is that we should re-examine our labour market institutions to see whether they are protecting those in jobs at the expense of those looking for jobs. At the same time  while income inequality may not seem fair  unemployment is not very fair either. Some of our labour market regulations  and many of our attitudes towards labour market outcomes  indeed some of our very ideas about fairness  stem from a time when the unemployment rate was 2 or 3 per cent. It was inconceivable then that unemployment would have an upward trend over twenty years  or that labour market regulation would have any significant role in that process. But the world has changed  and our ideas about what sorts of labour market arrangements are appropriate need to change too. This is already happening  as evidenced by recent reforms. My guess  however  is that this will not complete the process. Conclusion I began by talking about the need to lengthen the economic expansion. This  achieved by keeping inflation at bay  is the best contribution monetary policy can make to the long-term health of the economy. That long-term focus does not mean that we are too cautious  that we never take a risk; it simply means that we weigh the risks and rewards of policy actions over longer time horizons than many of the commentators on the economic scene which fill our newspapers and airwaves each day. We want an expanding economy  and low inflation. That offers the prospect that progress can be made in addressing the rate of unemployment  which remains too high by any standard in Australia. We fear  however  that the debate about whether unemployment will or BIS Review 53/1997 - 9 - will not reach supposed “targets” over the next year is missing the main point. Faster growth over the next year or two will help reduce unemployment. But it would be a great shame if that decline obscured the longer-term aspect to unemployment  which endures beyond the business cycle. BIS Review 53/1997
r970602a,1997-06-02,https://www.bis.org/review/r970602a.pdf,Bank of Japan's May review of monetary and economic trends in Japan (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  20 May 97),BANK OF JAPAN  MONTHLY ECONOMIC REVIEW  20/5/97.,Bank of Japan’s May review of monetary and economic trends in Japan BANK OF JAPAN  MONTHLY ECONOMIC REVIEW  20/5/97. Japan’s economy continues on a moderate recovery trend despite some fluctuations caused by the rise in the consumption tax rate  with private demand showing underlying firmness. With respect to final demand  public-sector investment has decreased  and housing investment has declined  reflecting the reversal in the stepped-up demand which took place ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate. However  net exports have continued to rise and business fixed investment is increasing steadily. Despite the reversal in the stepped-up demand caused by the consumption tax rate hike  the recovery in personal consumption has not been hindered  given the moderate but firm recovery in labor market conditions and income formation. In these circumstances  industrial production has been firm to recover the level of inventories which declined owing to the temporary surge in demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate. Meanwhile  prices have stopped declining  and growth in monetary aggregates has continued at around 3.0 per cent. With regard to personal consumption  outlays for travel have continued to increase moderately. With respect to goods  sales particularly in expensive goods surged in March 1997 ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate  followed by a decline in April as its reaction. Passenger-car sales recorded buoyant two-digit growth year-to-year for six consecutive months between October 1996 and March 1997  but showed a two-digit decline year-to-year in April. Although sales of electrical appliances  as well as sales at department stores and supermarkets  rose significantly in March 1997  April figures available for department stores in Tokyo are significantly below the previous year’s level. However  the recovery trend in personal consumption do not seem to have been hindered  as labor market conditions as well as household income formation are improving steadily  albeit moderately. Among leading indicators of business fixed investment  machinery orders have increased steadily. Construction floor area has also continued to recover moderately. With respect the seasonally-adjusted annual rate reached a significantly high level in the fourth quarter 1996  partly reflecting the stepped-up demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate. Later  they declined as the surge in demand reversed. investment  housing starts to housing terms of in Regarding public-sector investment  the amount of public works contracted has quite recently picked up somewhat  reflecting orders included in the supplementary budget for fiscal 1996. However  public-sector investment has been on a declining trend since spring 1996 when orders from the large economic stimulus package peaked out. Real exports are increasing  reflecting the moderate expansion of overseas economies and the effects of the yen’s depreciation between mid-1995 and April 1997 . Real imports have also continued to increase  reflecting such elements as the rise in domestic demand. However  growth has been moderate compared to that in exports against the background of the narrowing price differentials between home and abroad caused by the yen’s depreciation. Reflecting these developments in exports and imports  the real trade surplus has been rising since the second half of 1996. The nominal current-account surplus is also increasing  but its increase has been more moderate owing to rising crude oil prices until early 1997 and fluctuations in the income account. Industrial production increased at a significant pace in the fourth quarter 1996 and the first quarter 1997. Industrial production in April and May is expected to remain virtually BIS Review 54/1997 - 2 - unchanged at the level recorded in the first quarter 1997 despite the reversal in the surge in final demand. This has partly been supported by the recovery in inventories from the low level at the end of March 1997 created by the temporary surge in demand ahead of the consumption tax hike. Labor market conditions have continued to improve moderately on the whole. Although the unemployment rate remains at a high level and employment growth has been moderate  growth in nominal wages has been accelerating somewhat  reflecting the increase in production and corporate profits. The ratio of job offers to job applications has continued to improve. Prices have stopped declining. Domestic wholesale prices (adjusted for seasonal electricity rates) rose by almost 2 per cent in April 1997  as the rise in the consumption tax rate was almost fully passed on to prices. Downward pressures remain strong  including those from technological innovation  such as in electrical machinery  but domestic wholesale prices have remained unchanged or have risen marginally. This reflects the yen’s depreciation and higher oil prices to date  as well as the moderate improvement in domestic supply and demand conditions. The year-to-year declines in corporate service prices are narrowing steadily  mainly owing to the improvement in supply and demand conditions  although leasing charges continue to decline. In consumer prices (nationwide  excluding perishables)  overall consumer prices are marginally above the previous year’s level mainly because the year-to-year declines in goods prices have slowed. Growth in monetary aggregates  measured in terms of the year-to-year growth rate of M2 + CDs average outstanding  has slowed somewhat compared to that in summer 1996  reflecting the shift of assets to those outside M2 + CDs. Recently  M2 + CDs average outstanding grew at around 3 per cent on the whole. Regarding money market rates  the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) has moved at a level slightly below the official discount rate. The 3-month CD rate has stayed at around 0.55 per cent. Meanwhile  the long-term government bond yield declined to a record low of below 2.1 per cent in early April 1997. However  it recently rose to around 2.5 per cent as market uncertainties about the economic outlook and about Japanese financial institutions have gradually subsided in line with developments in the stock market. With respect to bank lending rates  the short-term prime lending rate has remained at a record low level of 1.625 per cent since September 1995. The long-term prime lending rate had been moving at the record low of 2.5 per cent since December 1996. Reflecting movements in long-term interest rates  however  it was raised by 0.6 percentage points to 3.1 per cent in May 1997. On the stock exchange  the Nikkei 225 stock average has been rising since the second half of April 1997  reflecting the fact that market uncertainties about the economic outlook and about Japanese financial institutions have gradually subsided  and the strong U.S. stock prices. In early May  it recovered to above ¥20 000 for the first time in four and a half months  and has recently continued to move at around ¥20 000. In the foreign exchange market  the yen depreciated between April and early May to around ¥126 - 127 to the U.S. dollar. However  the yen’s depreciation was later reversed rapidly  as concerns about the appreciation of the U.S. dollar strengthened  and as the differential in interest rates between Japan and the United States narrowed somewhat. The yen has recently BIS Review 54/1997 - 3 - moved at around ¥116 - 117 to the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile  the yen has appreciated against the deutsche mark and recently has moved at around ¥68.

Stals  at the Annual Dinner of the Pretoria branch of the Economic Society of South Africa held in Pretoria on 15/5/97.,Mr. Stals looks at the effects of the changing financial environment on monetary policy in South Africa Address by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank  Dr. C. Stals  at the Annual Dinner of the Pretoria branch of the Economic Society of South Africa held in Pretoria on 15/5/97. 1. The objectives of monetary policy The Gerhard de Kock Commission of Inquiry into the Monetary System and Monetary Policy in South Africa laid the foundation for the monetary policy model applied in South Africa over the past decade. Although the De Kock Commission’s final report on monetary policy was submitted in May 1985  it was only since 1986  when money supply targets were first introduced  that the implementation of the model took its course. Indeed  full implementation only came about after the untimely death of Gerhard de Kock in August 1989. In line with monetary policies applied in most developed economies  the South African monetary policy model is firmly directed towards the overall objective of creating and maintaining a stable financial environment. For central bankers  the ultimate price of a stable financial environment is a low rate of inflation -- a rate that  in the words of Alan Greenspan  will have no material effects on the macroeconomic decisions of consumers  investors  traders  producers and all other participants in total economic activity. This monetarist approach to monetary policy does not imply that central bankers have no interest in or sympathy for the national objectives of economic growth  job creation and the improvement of the living conditions of the people. On the contrary  central bankers believe that maximum economic development can only be achieved and sustained in an environment of stable financial conditions. The efforts of monetary policy must therefore be directed towards what central bankers can do best in support of the national objectives  and that is to manage the money system of the country in the interest of overall economic development. A stable financial environment is a precondition for sustainable economic development  but provides no guarantee that the real economy will indeed perform at maximum capacity. There are too many other macroeconomic (and non-economic) factors that will in the end determine the actual economic growth performance. There is  however  convincing theoretical logic and much empirical evidence to confirm that persistent unstable financial conditions are detrimental for growth  particularly in a country with an economy based on the principles of the market mechanism. The De Kock Commission therefore in 1985 summarised its findings as follows: “(The Commission) does not believe  for example  that anything can be gained in the long run in terms of real growth or employment by accepting higher inflation rates. The opposite is more likely to be true. Higher inflation will in the long run militate against growth and job creation. The objectives of external balance  growth and employment will over time be served best by creating and maintaining a climate of reasonable domestic price stability”. (Par 47) 2. The changing financial environment The deliberations of the De Kock Commission took place in an overall socio- political and economic environment that was completely different from what we have to contend with in South Africa today. With his wisdom and his foresight  Gerhard de Kock may have BIS Review 54/1997 - 2 - envisaged  and surely wished for  an environment in which monetary policy could be applied without the shackles of sanctions  boycotts  exchange controls  high inflation  social unrest and political distortions that characterised the period of his domain. Over the past decade  the situation has changed dramatically. The major socio-political reforms of the early 1990’s opened up the way for a normalisation of South Africa’s position in the world environment. Also in the field of economic and financial relations  South Africa has been reintegrated in the international community from which it was excluded over the preceding two decades. The international economic punitive actions against South Africa were repealed in great haste after the Government of National Unity took power in April 1994  and South Africa took its rightful place again in international forums such as the United Nations  the Bretton Woods Institutions (IMF and World Bank)  the Organisation of African Unity  and the British Commonwealth of Nations. South Africa became reintegrated into a world financial system that was vastly different from the one it had left in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s. The explosive developments during its absence in electronics and in communications  and the revolutionary trans-formation from mainly manufacturing/trading economies to a new service/information based culture  led to a strong movement of globalisation in financial market activity. This process forced the liberalisation of domestic and international financial markets in many countries  led to the abolition of exchange controls and exposed countries more directly to the disciplines of international markets. Today in South Africa  there are more than 60 foreign banks that compete through representative offices  branches and subsidiaries with the domestic banks to provide financial services to the South African community. We are in the process of gradually removing our exchange controls to join the other approximately 60 (out of 185) countries of the world  that have already succeeded in removing all restrictions on current and capital account international transactions. Non-residents participate very actively in the South African market for foreign exchange and in the domestic money and capital markets. Prices on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the Bond Exchange of South Africa are affected almost instantaneously by developments in the rest of the world. Volumes in these markets have exploded to a level that a De Kock Commission of fifteen years ago could not anticipate  not even in the wildest flight of the imagination. Recent changes in the South African community led to the more active absorption of many South Africans in the market economy. Latent demands were stimulated by the reforms and many expectations were created by the new political dispensation. The emphasis in fiscal policy has changed dramatically  with the retention  fortunately  of basic sound disciplines. The South African banking sector had to be restructured to provide for thousands of informal savings clubs (Stokvels) and for community banking. There is even pressure on the Reserve Bank to legalise fraudulent pyramid schemes such as those that recently brought the country of Albania to anarchy. 3. The implications for monetary policy The question does arise whether all these changes did not make the findings of the De Kock Commission irrelevant. Should monetary policy still hold onto the same objective  and has the task and the functions of the central bank perhaps not also changed over the past few years? BIS Review 54/1997 - 3 - The Reserve Bank believes  however  that the main objective of monetary policy as defined by the De Kock Commission is as important and warranted today as it was in the mid-1980s. Indeed  in the environment of a greater involvement of international participants in the South African financial markets  it is of even greater importance that South Africa shall maintain overall financial stability  that our rate of inflation shall be brought more in line with the average rate of inflation in the economies of our major trading partners  and that internationally recognised sound monetary and fiscal policies shall be applied at all times. The main objective of monetary policy in the new South Africa must remain to protect the value of the currency. Critics of this unbending attitude of the Reserve Bank often confuse the objective of monetary policy with three other aspects of Reserve Bank operations  namely the strategy followed by the Bank in pursuance of its objective  the operational procedures applied by the Bank  and the instruments used to achieve its objective. There may be a need at this juncture  in light of the major changes of the past few years  to reconsider some of these aspects of monetary policy that have more to do with the implementation of the policy  and not with the objective. The strategy of a central bank can be described as the model it uses to pursue the non-negotiable objective of protecting the value of the currency. On recommendation of the De Kock Commission  the South African monetary policy model was based on monetary targeting which anchors monetary policy decisions to changes in the money supply. This model worked extremely well  particularly in the times of South Africa’s economic isolation from the outside world. It is doubtful  however  if this model is still the most effective strategy to maintain in the new environment. It has  for example  become much more difficult for the Reserve Bank to control the money supply in a situation where so many foreign banks operate in South Africa  and where South African banks have so much easier access to financial resources from correspondent banks in the rest of the world. It is also a debatable issue whether the demand for credit in South Africa is not in the new environment less sensitive to interest rate changes than before. And  furthermore  the relationship between changes in the money supply and eventual price changes may have become much weaker now that the volumes of transactions in the financial markets have increased so much relative to turnovers in the markets for goods and services. There is no doubt that the money supply has lost some of its usefulness as an anchor for monetary policy. With South Africa not yet being ready for direct inflation targeting  and with our inability to fix the exchange rate of the rand because of a lack of foreign reserves  the Reserve Bank is gradually moving to a more ecclesiastic approach where a wider range of monetary indicators are being used as a basis for monetary policy decisions. This wider range of indicators includes changes in bank credit extension  the overall liquidity in the banking system  the level and the yield curve of interest rates  changes in the official foreign reserves and in the exchange rate of the rand and  of course  actual and expected movements in the rate of inflation. The operational procedures of the central bank include the methods used for providing accommodation to banking institutions  open market operations  intervention in the foreign exchange market  the manipulation of interest rates  and the signalling to markets of policy intentions. The South African Reserve Bank’s main operational procedures over recent years have been what the De Kock Commission described as the “classical cash reserve system as a means of controlling bank credit creation  rather than the socalled American cash reserve system”. (Par. 76) BIS Review 54/1997 - 4 - Without going into the details  in the South African system the Reserve Bank uses its open market operations and other instruments of monetary policy to force banking institutions to borrow more from the discount window whenever it is regarded as necessary to apply a more restrictive policy. At some stage  the Reserve Bank will then also raise the Bank rate which  in a situation of great dependence on the central bank  will force the private banks to follow with increases in their lending and deposit rates. Many other central banks operating in sophisticated financial markets are now influencing short-term interest rates more directly with their operations in the markets. Instead of overnight loans provided at the discount window  they enter into repurchase transactions with banking institutions  with the added advantage that it can be coupled with a tender system for central bank money  and a variable Bank rate. The South African Reserve Bank will also have to introduce greater flexibility in the operating procedures for the implementation of monetary policy if we want to cope with the volatile international capital flows  exchange rate changes  and financial assets price movements. It is of some concern to the Reserve Bank that over the past year interest rates in the South African money market seem to have become more rigid. In the present system  the Bank no longer gets reliable signals from market interest rates on changes in the underlying financial conditions. If necessary  the operational procedures of the Bank will have to change to bring more interest rate flexibility into the money market. Finally  the instruments used for monetary policy may also have to be adapted to the changing financial environment. In the past  the Reserve Bank  for example  often used the Exchequer Account of the Government for the short-term withdrawal of surplus funds from the money market. The recent introduction of an improved system for tax and loan accounts held by Government with private banks  rules out the extensive use of this instrument for monetary policy purposes. Similarly  arrangements now under negotiation with the Department of Finance to relieve the Reserve Bank of the responsibilities for the primary issue of Government bonds  and for the development of the secondary market in these bonds  will also change the Bank’s position in the capital market. It opens up the way for the Bank to have a more single-minded open market policy approach. The introduction of repurchase transactions in strictly defined acceptable underlying financial assets will also provide an instrument of monetary policy that is more malleable and can be adapted easier to the needs of the new financial environment of which South Africa is now rapidly becoming an integral part. 4. Conclusion There is much room for a continuing debate in South Africa on monetary policy  but not so much on the issue of what the objectives of monetary policy should be  or whether inflation is bad or good for the overriding objective of creating more jobs in the country. The debate should rather concentrate on the effectiveness of the strategy  the operational procedures and the instruments used in the pursuance of a monetary policy objective that has in any case been casted in iron in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.

Duisenberg  at the occasion of the Marshall Plan celebration in Washington on 15/5/97.,Mr. Duisenberg assesses what we have learned from the Marshall Plan Dinner speech held by the President of the Netherlands Bank and of the Bank for International Settlements  Dr. W.F. Duisenberg  at the occasion of the Marshall Plan celebration in Washington on 15/5/97. On 5th June this year it will be exactly 50 years ago since George C. Marshall  in a speech at Harvard University  set out his plans for the economic recovery of Europe. Although I fear that I will not succeed in making as momentous a speech as Marshall did  I am honoured to speak to you here today and commemorate this historic occasion  which I believe marks the starting point of Europe’s post-war economic miracle. Anniversaries such as this present a useful opportunity to reflect on our past successes and to draw lessons from them. This is the challenging task which the organisers of this conference have set out before me today and I will endeavour not to disappoint them. In doing so  I would like to start out by pondering for a moment on what it was exactly that the Marshall Plan contributed to post-war economic recovery. Although the importance of the Marshall Plan is relatively undisputed  the channels through which it boosted economic growth have been the subject of lively debate. Only if the role of the Marshall Plan is put into the proper perspective  can we hope to fruitfully draw on our past experiences. Subsequently  I will attempt to apply what we have learned to the current transformation process in Central and Eastern Europe  which shows some interesting similarities with post-war reconstruction. As I will argue  however  the transformation process in transition economies is  in other respects  uniquely different. In my view this precludes using the Marshall Plan as a blueprint for aid to transition economies  although it harbours some important lessons. Finally  a word of caution is in order. I am a central banker. As such  I will focus on the economic aspects of the Marshall Plan  not the political ones. Such a discussion is necessarily incomplete; but I will leave it to others to comment on the political and diplomatic context in which Marshall aid took place. The contribution of the Marshall Plan – distinguishing fact from fiction Marshall aid was a lifeline from the United States to Europe at a time when  economically  Europe had been brought down to its knees. Between 1948–1951 the program annually transferred roughly 1% of American GDP  or around $ 13 billion in aid  to some 16 European countries. In net present value terms this amounts to roughly $ 80 billion. By 1951  six years after the war and the effective end of the Marshall Plan  national incomes per capita were more than 10 percent above pre-war levels  while the economic growth rate in the next two decades reached levels which were twice as high as for any comparable period before or since. This temporal coincidence between the extension of Marshall aid and the “miraculous” recovery of Europe has induced the inferral of a causal relationship. It should be noted  however  that  even after extensive academic research  the roots of Europe’s economic miracle are not yet adequately understood. Thus  it is difficult to isolate the contribution of the Marshall Plan. Economically  the strong post-war growth performance is in large part explained by the so-called Solow residual – that is  not by traditional factors such as capital and labour. This is an economist’s way of saying we do not fully understand what is going on. A first observation in this regard is that the reconstruction of Europe did not start in 1948 – the year in which the first Marshall aid was disbursed – but in 1945. At that time the US was already channelling large amounts of aid to Europe through the United Nations Relief BIS Review 54/1997 - 2 - and Recovery Administration and other programs. This aid  which was in the order of $ 4 billion annually in the first two post-World War II years  was – in flow terms – in the same order of magnitude as the Marshall aid. A second observation is that  given the unprecedented magnitude of aid from the perspective of the donor community  the Marshall Plan in a quantitative sense played a smaller role than one would expect in accelerating the replacement and expansion of the European capital stock. Marshall aid accounted for less than 2.5% of the combined national incomes of recipient countries between 1948 and 1951. While this is indeed a significant sum  this resulted in at most a 1% increase in investment  at a time when domestic investment was running at 15% of GNP. In other words  this does not explain growth rates several percentage points above their historic trend levels. It should be noted  however  that growth may have been stimulated through other channels  for instance  by providing much-needed hard currency reserves which could be used for financing industrial raw materials. Over a third of Marshall aid was used in this way. A third observation is that the Marshall Plan also did not play a large role in financing the reconstruction of devastated infrastructure as this had been largely accomplished before the program got underway. In fact  countries that were major aid recipients saw the government spending share of national income fall relative to other nations  the opposite of what one would expect if there had in fact been a shortage of public investment capital. So how did Marshall aid matter? Recently  there has been a shift among academics to what might be termed as a “revisionist” analysis of the contribution of the Marshall Plan to European recovery. According to this view  the Plan’s main contribution was to alter the environment in which economic policy was made  tilting the balance in a qualitative manner rather than quantitatively. As you will recall  in 1947  two years after the war  Europe was still characterised by macroeconomic instability  inflation and an increasingly tight balance of payments constraint. The initial response by governments had been to counter inflation by retaining controls  thereby prompting the growth of black markets and discouraging transactions at official prices. By distorting the allocative mechanism of the market  saving and initiative were discouraged. The appropriate response as prescribed by economic theory would have been to decontrol prices to induce producers to bring their goods to market. In addition  fiscal discipline and monetary restraint was necessary  in order to reduce inflationary pressures. Such policies  however  require political compromise and sacrifice by everyone which at that time  when the needs of Europe were greatest  were not necessarily forthcoming. The Marshall Plan may have played a critical role by easing decisions over the distribution of scarce resources. Of course  the extended aid did not obviate the need for sacrifice but it increased the size of the distributional pie available to the various interest groups. In my opinion  however  the most important channel through which the Marshall Plan contributed is through its conditionality  with which the US was able to exercise significant influence over the economic policies of Marshall aid recipients. Although over the years the Plan has become synonymous with the substantial aid flows transferred from the US to Europe  it is useful to recall that before receiving that aid each recipient country had to sign a bilateral pact with the US. In that pact  countries agreed to balance their budgets  restore financial stability  stabilise the exchange rate at realistic levels and enhance mutual cooperation. Along with the carrot  thus came the stick. In many ways this is similar to the approach followed in later years by the International Monetary Fund in its macroeconomic adjustment programs. BIS Review 54/1997 - 3 - Not only could the Marshall aid itself not be spent freely – it could be spent on external goods only with the approval of the US government – but the recipient was also required to place a matching amount of domestic currency in a counterpart fund to be used only for purposes approved by the Marshall Plan administration. As such  for each dollar of Marshall aid  the US had control over 2 dollars of real resources. In some instances the US insisted that the funds be used to buttress financial stability. Britain used the bulk of its counterpart funds to retire public debt. In the case of France  the US used the counterpart funds as a tool to pressure the new government into reaffirming its willingness to continue policies leading to a balanced budget. West Germany found the release of counterpart funds delayed until the nationalised railway had reduced expenditures to match revenues. Nations undergoing high inflation could not draw on counterpart funds until the Marshall Plan administration was satisfied that they had achieved a workable stabilisation program. As a condition for receiving Marshall Plan aid  each country was required to develop a program for removing trade controls in order to promote intra-European trade. The multilateral manner in which this was achieved – through the OECD in which all Marshall recipients were united – contributed significantly to the European integration process. The most important institutional innovation in this regard was the establishment of the European Payments Union in 1950  a product of the Marshall Plan. The Marshall Plan should thus be thought of as a large and highly successful structural adjustment program. At this stage  I believe it is useful to draw two preliminary lessons: – The first lesson to be drawn from the Marshall Plan is that the central element in post-war Europe’s economic success was sound economic policy. – The second lesson is that even aid flows in the order of magnitude as those under the Marshall Plan are likely to be small compared to resources generated domestically. Nevertheless such aid flows are likely to facilitate the adoption of otherwise painful economic policies. A new Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe? An interesting question is to what extent we can apply these lessons to the current transformation process in Central and Eastern Europe  to which I will refer as Eastern Europe from now on? To some extent  of course  this question is rendered out of date by the fact that the transition process in a number of countries has been underway for over seven years now. The International Monetary Fund has more or less adopted a role similar to that of the Marshall Plan. Through its macroeconomic adjustment programs credits are extended on the basis of countries meeting economic performance criteria. As such  IMF macroeconomic stabilisation programs form a crucial first step in the transformation process  without which the longer lasting structural reforms cannot take hold. Of the early reformers – Hungary  Poland  the Czech Republic  Slovakia  the Baltics  Croatia and Slovenia – only Hungary still has an IMF program  but it is of a precautionary nature; no purchases are made. In fact  since 1995 these countries have been making net payments to the Fund and some have obtained access to international financial markets. Others  however  are less advanced and still in need of the required reforms. The transition process  so far  seems to mirror the circumstances leading to the adoption of the Marshall Plan in two important regards. First  financial instability which was BIS Review 54/1997 - 4 - pervasive in the early years of post-World War II Europe is also present in several transition economies. As for Europe 50 years ago  an important precondition for growth to take off is the stabilisation of prices and  after an initial adjustment  the exchange rate. This has been the purview of the IMF in its adjustment programs  which through the extension of credits has somewhat facilitated the adoption of painful economic policies. Second  both Europe in 1948 and Eastern Europe at present have experienced a period of intensive government intervention  albeit for different reasons. This has created a habit of control and regulation along with a certain unease with the workings of the market  similar to the mistrust of the market in post-war Europe following the failure of market mechanisms during the Great Depression. In both periods  the myriad of restrictions needs to be abolished  and structural reform needs to take hold. But there are also important differences between the transformation process and post-war recovery. The Marshall Plan was effective at least in part because Europe had experience with markets. It possessed the institutions needed for their operation. Property rights  bankruptcy codes  court systems to enforce market contracts – not to mention entrepreneurial skills – all were in place. This institutional basis has been lacking in Eastern Europe. Moreover  the physical allocation mechanism and absence of meaningful prices were much more extreme than under wartime rationing. Second  the scale on which enterprises in Eastern Europe need to be restructured finds no comparison in post-war Europe. On the issue  for instance  how fast to close certain factories given the absence of an adequate social safety net  the experience of post-war Europe is of little help simply because there was little to close down. In addition  the post-war experience does not teach us how to implement mass privatisation  nor how to put a huge sector of large state enterprises on a commercial basis  all simultaneously. Third  transition economies have to liberalise their economies in an already highly liberalised international environment and of highly developed international capital markets. In such a context  policy mistakes or a lack of market confidence can easily lead to a large and rapid outflow of capital  thus draining away much-needed savings. These problems are exacerbated by weak financial systems where experience and expertise in  for instance  credit allocation is lacking. So what does Eastern Europe need? This leads me to believe that the needs of Eastern Europe are different from those of post-war Europe under the Marshall Plan. At a conference several years ago  the reform process in Eastern Europe was compared first with post-war reconstruction and then with the reconversion of regions or industries in decline.1 Of the latter  we have plenty of examples  for instance  the shipbuilding industry in Europe or the coal  steel and textile sectors. Generally speaking  the transformation of these industries is a slow and painful process  usually at a high cost. Whereas post-war reconstruction was a process of building upon what existed  reconversion  by its nature  implies changing and perhaps destroying the existing structure  not building upon it. This is much harder to achieve. Which experience is the more relevant for Eastern Europe? In my opinion: reconversion. The discussion in Eastern Europe is not so much 1 Blanchard O. “Panel discussion: Lessons for Eastern Europe today”  Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today  MIT Press  Cambridge MA  1993. BIS Review 54/1997 - 5 - about rebuilding existing structures  but rather about replacing them by new ones; similar to the replacement of declining West European industries by new ones. The question is whether we can aid this reconversion process by transferring comparable amounts of money towards Eastern Europe as under the Marshall Plan. Transferring the equivalent of 2.5% of national incomes of the recipient countries  has been estimated to cost roughly $ 20 billion a year. The Bretton Woods institutions have of course been extending credits but on a smaller scale. By comparison  the annual flow of total official financing to Eastern Europe has been around $ 15 billion  some 25% below that which was transferred under the Marshall Plan. Total flows  however  including private financing  reached some $ 36 billion in 1996. From the recipient’s perspective  therefore  the amount of financing transferred to Eastern Europe is quite significant. From a donor’s perspective  on the other hand  the present effort still pales somewhat compared to the tremendous display of solidarity by the US after World War II. In this regard  we should remember that the US financed the entire Marshall Plan by itself. If industrial countries were to make a similar effort and transfer 1% of their GDP to Eastern Europe  aid flows to this region would amount to more than $ 170 billion a year  much more than the current $ 15 billion. This again illustrates the unique nature of the post-war US contribution. It is uncertain whether increasing the amount of official financing to Marshall aid standards would yield significant additional benefits. It could further facilitate support for required reforms  but to measure the marginal benefit of extra aid in these political terms is very difficult. In any case  it is critical that whatever programs are adopted  aid should be provided on the basis of actions taken rather than need. The achievements of the Marshall Plan suggest that the transformation process in Eastern Europe would be significantly enhanced by intensifying mutual cooperation in the area. Cooperation in the fields of trade  financial and monetary matters could become the engine of economic growth just as it was during the post-war boom. Between 1948–1952 trade among European countries increased more than 5 times as fast as European trade with other continents. One of the lessons of the post-war era is that trade can be the engine in a process of economic restructuring. At the same time  the post-war experience evinced the importance of foreign demand in underpinning a supply-side response. In other words  access for the East European countries to the markets of the European Community. The European Union has concluded “Europe Agreements” with ten Eastern European countries. These are important steps and they can be built upon further. Constructive mutual cooperation will be most conducive to a positive perception of the region’s stability  thereby helping attract investment. Cooperation could gain an added dimension in the future. Several Eastern European countries have already joined the OECD as members and are knocking on the door of the European Union. Although eventual EU membership is a process that will require some time  it is a realistic perspective. The European Union is in the process of completing a process of deepening cooperation  which will find its preliminary climax in the establishment of the euro. Subsequent to the creation of full monetary union we may expect the EU to turn its sights eastwards  leading to an ever more integrated Europe. Let me conclude by reaffirming that the Marshall Plan was an important part of the foundation for post-war European recovery. At the same time  Marshall aid was more than the transfer of money alone. The economic policy conditions attached to this aid constituted an essential element in the realisation of the reconstruction process. Like the US after World War II  the IMF has stepped into the transformation process of transition economies  albeit on a smaller scale in financial terms. In part  this may reflect the lower importance attached to the role of finance per se  and  in part  simply the lack of adequate donor funds forthcoming. Despite BIS Review 54/1997 - 6 - this  however  Eastern Europe is on the right track. And although EU membership is still some way off  the prospect of such membership and the economic cooperation and integration being pursued to achieve that membership  inspires confidence that the lessons of the Marshall Plan have indeed been taken to heart.

Carse  a Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Aurthority  at the Bankers’ Association for Foreign Trade 75th Anniversary Annual Meeting held in Florida on 6/5/97. I am pleased to be here this morning to talk to you about the Hong Kong perspective on the trends in global regulation. I have been asked particularly to talk about our experience of being a host supervisor - in other words  what it is like to be on the receiving end of consolidated supervision. This is quite appropriate because  although the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is the home supervisor for a number of local banks with overseas operations  the distinguishing characteristic of Hong Kong is that it is the host to almost 500 banks from over 40 different countries. This is in keeping with its role as one of the leading international financial centres in the world with the third largest representation of foreign banks and the fifth largest total of external assets. Hong Kong after 1997 Of course  Hong Kong’s other distinguishing characteristic is that it will experience a reversion of sovereignty to China in less than two months’ time. This has naturally aroused much interest and speculation among the foreign banks based in Hong Kong about the legal and regulatory environment which will apply after the handover on 30 June  and I will therefore try to explain to you briefly the main features of the arrangements that will apply. These arrangements are laid down in the Basic Law which establishes the post-1997 constitution for Hong Kong. It is based on the “one country  two systems” concept under which Hong Kong shall enjoy a high degree of autonomy as a Special Administrative region of China. In the banking and monetary areas  this means that: Hong Kong shall retain the status of an international financial centre. The Government of Hong Kong shall be responsible for monetary policy and practice in Hong Kong and for regulation of financial markets and institutions. There shall be free flow of capital within  into and out of Hong Kong. The HK dollar  as the local legal tender  shall continue to circulate and remain freely convertible. It must be backed by a 100% reserve fund. The Exchange Fund which holds the foreign currency reserves of Hong Kong shall be managed and controlled by the Government of Hong Kong  primarily for regulating the exchange value of the HK dollar. The framework that will apply after 1997 is therefore quite clear. The question which then follows is whether the framework will be applied in practice. I think that there are a number of good reasons to believe that it will be. In the first place  we now have institutional arrangements in Hong Kong to put the financial sector provisions of the Basic Law into practice. In particular  the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  which I represent  has the legal powers  monetary instruments and financial resources - including US$ 63 billion of foreign currency reserves - to fulfill its role as the central bank of Hong Kong and to maintain the value of the HK dollar. During the four years of its existence  the HKMA has built up a good working relationship with the People’s Bank of China which has made it clear in public that it will not take over the role of the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong after 1997. The separate role for Hong Kong after 1997 is underscored by its separate membership alongside China of international organizations such as the Bank for International Settlements and the Asian Development Bank  and its participation in the IMF’s New Arrangements to Borrow. BIS Review 55/1997 - 2 - Of course  what matters is not what I say but what the market actually thinks. Judged by this criterion  there is genuine confidence about the future. This is shown by the consistent stability of the HK dollar; the strength of the stock market  though it has its ups and downs in line with expectations about US interest rates; the growth in HK dollar deposits of about 20% over the last year; and the decline in the margin of our 10-year Exchange Fund Notes over US Treasuries to around 50bp compared with 90bp at the end of 1996. So far as foreign banks operating in Hong Kong are concerned  Hong Kong political risk largely seems to have disappeared as an issue. We have seen no exodus of banks from Hong Kong; rather  we have seen an increased appetite among the foreign banks to take on long-term HK dollar assets  including residential mortgage loans and syndicated credits. Although the margin on these have come down significantly over the last year  they are still attractive compared with the margins available to foreign banks in their home countries. The importance of international regulatory standards We do not anticipate any radical changes in Hong Kong’s system of banking supervision after 1997  nor in its attitude to the entry of foreign banks. No doubt  however  these will evolve in line with trends in global regulation. This reflects the guiding principle of our supervision in Hong Kong which is to follow international standards. There are a number of practical reasons for wanting to do so. First  it is in keeping with Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. Reputable foreign banks will only want to do business in a market where the rules of the game are familiar and credible. Their home supervisors will certainly feel the same way. There is thus absolutely no advantage for centres such as Hong Kong to compete on laxity or to market themselves as places where dubious transactions can be conducted and concealed. Second  when trying to enforce new supervisory guidelines and rules on our local banks  one of the first questions they will ask is what is being done elsewhere. It is thus very helpful to be able to point to the relevant international standard in order to confer legitimacy on what we are trying to achieve. Of course  this presupposes that international standards are relevant to individual countries and territories. The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision has played a major role in setting standards which do have such relevance. In particular  the Basle capital adequacy ratio  which is still called the “Cooke ratio” in parts of Asia in deference to our chairman here today  has become the de facto capital standard in most supervisory systems around the world despite the fact that it was originally intended to apply only to internationally active banks. Despite this enormous achievement  however  it can be argued that the subsequent work of the Committee did become somewhat too narrowly focused on issues which are of principal interest to supervisors from G-10 countries. This is only natural since these are the people who comprise the Basle Committee but it perhaps left something of a vacuum in the setting and promulgation of standards with more global relevance. In particular  much of the work of the Basle Committee has been dominated in recent years by the formulation of its recommendations to extend the capital adequacy regime to cover the market risk arising from trading in derivatives and other financial instruments. I am not denying that a capital regime to cover market risk is necessary  particularly for those countries like the United States whose banks are heavily involved in trading activities. We are intending to introduce the regime in Hong Kong by the end of this year  and a number of countries in the Asian region are intending to do the same. However  they are doing so largely to be seen to be adhering to international standards  rather than because their banks are running substantial trading risks. Even in Hong Kong  which has the fifth largest foreign exchange BIS Review 55/1997 - 3 - market in the world and the seventh largest derivatives market  the incorporation of market risk will have only a minor impact on most banks’ capital adequacy ratios. The concentration on market risk has perhaps led to other supervisory areas not receiving the attention which they deserve. In particular  credit risk still remains the main risk facing most banks  and it is therefore disappointing that there are still no internationally agreed guidelines in areas such as loan classification  bad debt provisioning and non-accrual of interest on non- performing loans. Most countries in Asia  including Hong Kong  do have their own rules in these areas but the lack of an agreed standard makes it difficult to undertake cross-country comparisons of asset quality. I hope  therefore  that this is an area which can be addressed by the Basle Committee in the near future. I am encouraged by the fact that the Basle Committee has recently intensified its efforts to reach out beyond the G-10 countries and to take a more proactive leadership role in helping to strengthen banking supervision in all countries. In particular  the recently issued consultative paper on Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision is an important milestone. The Core Principles are intended to establish minimum requirements which would apply in all supervisory systems. It is intended that supervisory authorities around the world should use them as an agenda against which to assess the adequacy of their own systems and to press for changes to address any deficiencies. The Core Principles will also increasingly become the standard by which outside commentators  including other supervisors  judge the supervisory framework of individual countries. This external discipline will help to provide an additional incentive to improve supervisory systems. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is proud to have been one of the supervisory authorities which participated in the drafting of the Core Principles. We were also members of the Working Party of both G-10 and non-G10 countries which recently prepared a report on measures to foster financial stability which was submitted to the meeting of G-7 Finance Ministers last month in Washington. This includes recommendations not only on the formulation of sound principles and practices  but also on how these can be effectively implemented  including the role of international financial institutions in this respect. Regulatory cooperation in Asia These initiatives are being supplemented in Asia by regional cooperation on both a bilateral and multilateral basis. There have been a number of factors driving this. The aftermath of the Mexican crisis in January 1995  which saw speculative attacks on a number of Asian currencies  encouraged the view that there was a need for countries in the region to strengthen their defences in this area. We have thus seen the arrangement of an interlocking series of bilateral repo agreements using US Treasuries between Asian central banks  including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. These agreements are intended to provide additional liquidity for exchange rate stability purposes. More generally  there has also perhaps been a feeling among the Asian countries that the existing arrangements for central bank cooperation were somewhat “euro-centric” and did not take adequate account of the growing importance of the Asian region where over 40% of the world’s foreign currency reserves are now held. This feeling has to some extent been addressed by the more participative approach now being adopted by the Basle Committee and the BIS. But there is nonetheless a view that greater regional cooperation among Asian central banks is both necessary and desirable. This has been summed up in the concept of an “Asian BIS”  though this is somewhat misleading as there are no immediate plans to move towards the BIS Review 55/1997 - 4 - institutional structure which the name would imply. Rather  the current emphasis is on promoting an informal grouping of central banks called EMEAP (“Executives’ Meeting of East Asia and Pacific Central Banks) which is exploring opportunities for cooperation in areas such as payment systems  reserves management and banking supervision. Among other things  this may provide the opportunity over time to develop a more distinctive and focused regional voice on international supervisory issues. Consolidated supervision I will now return to the topic which I raised at the beginning of my speech  which is how we view consolidated supervision from the receiving end. I suppose that it goes without saying that we are in favour of the concept of consolidated supervision. As an international financial centre  we are vulnerable to adverse developments in banks abroad and we rely heavily on the consolidated supervision of the supervisors of those banks. The ability to conduct consolidated supervision is a key factor in whether we regard the home supervision of a particular bank as adequate - which is one of the criteria for granting a banking licence in Hong Kong. Within the legal framework in Hong Kong we try to cooperate with overseas regulators to ensure that they can effectively undertake consolidated supervision. In particular  we allow home supervisors to carry out on-site examinations of their institutions in Hong Kong subject to obtaining our prior consent - which we have not hitherto withheld. In addition  the Hong Kong Monetary Authority itself has the power to pass on information to foreign regulators to assist them in the exercise of their functions. At present  however  this power to disclose does not extend to information about individual customers  though this is an area which we are intending to review in the light of the recommendations of the Basle Committee. In the meantime  we do not impose constraints on access to customer information in the course of on-site examinations in Hong Kong by overseas regulators. What reservations I have about consolidated supervision therefore relate mainly to how the system operates in practice: first  it may of course be difficult in practice to assess the adequacy of consolidated supervision by a home supervisor and how much reliance should be placed on it by the host supervisor. As mentioned above  the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision will provide a useful checklist in this respect  but there will still be the problem of whether the Principles are being effectively implemented. A more active monitoring role by the International Monetary Fund may help in this respect. But in some cases the best judgment that it may be possible to make is that the supervisory authority is actively working to establish the necessary capability - which is essentially the view that we have taken in relation to the People’s Bank of China in licensing banks from the Mainland; second  it is important to realize that  in undertaking consolidated supervision  the primary responsibility of the home supervisor will be to safeguard the interests of the parent bank. While this should hopefully help to promote the safety and soundness of the banking group as a whole  including overseas banking subsidiaries  the interests of home and host supervisor may not necessarily coincide. Despite this  the various regulators should  of course  try to cooperate to the maximum extent possible; third  and related to the previous point  cooperation will only be possible if there is an adequate two-way flow of information. However  the main focus of consolidated supervision sometimes appears to be for the home supervisor to obtain information from the host supervisor. There is less emphasis on reciprocal flows. For example  in the recent paper prepared jointly by the Basle Committee and the Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors on Supervision of Cross-Border Banking  only four paragraphs out of BIS Review 55/1997 - 5 - forty-three are devoted to information flows from home supervisor to host supervisor. In our experience  home supervisors can be reluctant to share information with us  either at the time of authorization or  more particularly  if serious problems arise in the parent bank. In some cases  however  the situation is improving and the recent more proactive approach of the Japanese supervisory authorities deserves a commendable mention in this respect. I stress again that I am not intending to cast doubt on the value of consolidated supervision  but rather to point out that the reality does not always match the rhetoric. The answer can only be for individual supervisory authorities to build up a relationship of trust which allows for a free flow of information in both directions  adequate safeguards on the confidentiality of information received and an avoidance of over-hasty and disruptive supervisory action based on that information. At the end of the day the effectiveness of global regulation depends in large measure on cooperation among regulators. As a major international financial centre  Hong Kong will continue  after 30 June 1997 as it has done before  to play its part in fostering such cooperation. BIS Review 55/1997

The foreign exchange market turns over US$ 1.2 trillion daily  roughly one quarter of annual world exports. The regulation of financial markets therefore concerns us all. This paper covers the What  Why  Who and How of financial regulation. Financial markets engage in the exchange of property rights. Financial assets are derivatives of physical or real assets  derivatives being property rights of property rights that are not “lumpy” or asset specific  and transactions costs in them being lower than transactions in real assets. The first thing to remember about financial products is that they are all defined by the law. Therefore  all financial transactions are about transactions in legal products  under procedures regulated by rules or laws. Even financial institutions are  strictly speaking  legal constructs. To paraphrase another French philosopher: Man is born free  but after that he is bound by the law. What is Financial Regulation? The Dictionary of Finance defines regulation as actions that ‘command and control’ the individual decisions of firms  in an effort to prevent private decision-making that would take inadequate account of the ’public interest’. Regulation may be self-imposed  or  as is usual  by a third party. The Government may intervene in a market or industry in the form of law  administrative rules  taxation or moral suasion. Self-regulation could be imposed through industry associations and codes of conduct. The regulatory framework will shape market behaviour. Therefore  the design and practice of the regulatory framework determines the efficiency and performance of the regulated market. Why Regulations? There are a few theories that attempt to explain the existence and forms of regulation  including: - the competition for regulation theory suggests that there exists a market for regulation  in which consumers and producers compete. Regulation will serve the interests of those who are willing to offer the most for the regulation. Since regulation can be regarded as a public good  the free-rider problem suggests that the benefit to the individual consumer is likely to be small relative to the producer. Therefore  producers will have more incentive to try and obtain favourable regulation through industry associations. A countervailing force is therefore the consumer lobby; and capture theory suggests that producers capture regulatory agencies and control them in their own interests. Vested interests reinforce the regulatory framework to BIS Review 55/1997 - 2 - support their interests  but the danger is that such behaviour would result in non-competitiveness in the international market  leading to long-run social loss. If we believe the above theories  and assume that regulations impose ultimately a cost on the consumer or taxpayer  it may be in the public interest to remove regulations and allow greater competition. This is the primary driving force behind current market deregulation policies prevalent in OECD markets. A recent example of the deregulation drive to “make markets work better” is the report of the Australian Financial System Inquiry (Wallis Report)  whose recommendations seek to:- create a flexible regulatory structure which will be more responsive to the forces for change operating on the financial system; clarify regulatory goals; increase the accountability of the agencies charged with meeting those goals; ensure that the regulation of similar financial products be more consistent and promote competition by improving comparability; introduce greater competitive neutrality across the financial system; establish more contestable  efficient and fair financial markets  resulting in reduced costs to consumers; provide more effective regulation for financial conglomerates which will also facilitate competition and efficiency; and facilitate the international competitiveness of the Australian financial system. On the other hand  a market without regulation also does not work. Free banking and frontier capitalism results in control by the Mafia  with huge losses inflicted on the innocent and unwary. The public interest theory argues that regulation is an attempt to correct for market failures  such as monopoly  externalities and lack of information. For example  the social cost of the failure of a financial institution may be much higher than the private cost to the institution itself. Therefore  financial institutions left to themselves will accept more risk than is optimal from a systemic point of view  thus forming the basic case for government regulation of banking activity and the establishment of capital requirements (Martin Feldstein  quoted in Dale  1996). On this basis  we can justify the case for external regulations on private sector behaviour on four broad grounds which all relate to market failure:- first  the moral hazard argument. If a market participant believes that the state will underwrite his losses  then behaviour will change. A good example is how deposit insurance encourages depositors and bankers to engage in risky behaviour that forces the state to pay in the end  thus undermining market discipline and entailing regulation. second  the widows and orphans argument. These regulations provide protection to poorly (asymmetrically) informed clients  based on the view that small depositors and investors cannot assess properly the riskiness of financial institutions they deal with. third  the public policy argument. In free market economies  public policy arguments call for competition and free trade. An example would be anti-trust laws in some countries to prevent monopolisation of certain markets. fourth  the systemic risk issue  which allows the state to prevent the failure of one participant to destabilize the whole system. This justifies the regulation  for example  of the payment system and the banking sector. BIS Review 55/1997 - 3 - Regulation therefore has two important dimensions that must always be borne in mind. First  regulation is a cost that is like taxation: someone bears the cost of regulation. The public must always ask whether the benefits outweigh the costs. Second  regulation has a time element - regulations must change with the times. Old regulations may prevent or impede market growth. As markets change  so must regulations. Third  regulation should not prevent the effective working of market forces. For example  we should avoid bank failures  but not prevent all bank failures. Chairman Alan Greenspan of the US Fed (1997)  said “our goal as supervisors should not be to prevent all bank failures  but to maintain sufficient prudential standards so that banking problems that do occur do not become widespread.” What are we regulating? We can regulate products  functions or institutions or a combination of all three. Problems arise when we have overlapping regulatory terrain  competing regulatory agencies and confused regulatory objectives. There are also arguments for and against the concentration and competition in regulatory agencies. A good example of a one-stop regulatory agency is the Monetary Authority of Singapore  which combines the regulation of the banking system  the securities market and the insurance industry in one institution. At the other end of the spectrum  the US banking sector is regulated by at least four different agencies  the Federal Reserve system  the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the state banking commissioners. Since US banks are increasingly engaged in securities areas  their functions are also subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and consumer lobbies. Regulation may be based on product types such that each regulatory authority specialises in one financial product. Under this framework  a securities regulator will concentrate in the oversight of securities activities  irrespective of the type of financial institutions that are carrying out this business. Functional regulation is generally conducted by two separate regulatory bodies  an investor protection arm and a systemic stability arm. The investor protection arm deals with retail depositors and small investors to ensure fair conduct  equitable competition and customer protection. The systemic stability agency  on the other hand  looks at the larger players and wholesale activities. It would also be responsible for the safety  structure and functioning of all payment systems and financial markets. Preventive measures include capital adequacy requirements; constraints on connected lending and other rules aimed at preventing insolvency; and an official safety net such as lender of last resort or deposit insurance. This approach follows the Goodhart (1995) model  which suggests that the difference in focus and function of investor protection and systemic stability is large enough to justify two separate regulatory bodies in each country to share the regulatory responsibilities. According to Goodhart  the formulation of rules for the safety of the system should be the responsibility of the systemic stability arm. On the other hand  the monitoring and operation of the system should be divided between the two arms on the basis of their size  e.g. balance sheet. Another regulatory framework  which developed historically  takes the form of institutional regulation. It reflects institutional segmentation within each country  with insurance companies  securities houses  mortgage lending companies and banks becoming the concern of differing regulatory bodies. Institutional regulation becomes less practicable as the barriers between operating in differing functional and geographical financial markets have been eroded. BIS Review 55/1997 - 4 - the In between  regulatory system may be organised along mixed functional/institutional lines. As banks  securities houses and insurance companies compete in each other’s turf  there is now a less meaningful difference between institutions and functions. One model  colloquially known as “Twin Peaks”  consists of a Financial Stability Commission  with responsibility for systemic risk  the prudential supervision of all major institutions  and conduct of business regulation of wholesale activities  and a Consumer Protection Commission  which could be in charge of conduct of business regulation in retail markets  as well as detecting market manipulation and insider dealing. It would also carry out prudential supervision of those stock brokers and fund managers who deal with private clients  and of independent intermediaries. This is essentially the model adopted by the Wallis Commission. Approaches to Regulation The latest mantra on financial regulation is the International Monetary Fund’s for “Internal Governance  Official Oversight  and Market approach  which calls Incentives”(Lindgren  1996). To this  I would add  “Robust Financial Infrastructure”. The first line of protection against bank failure must be internal management’s own risk controls. The growing complexity and variety of banking business suggests that neither the authorities nor informed customers can prevent internal management from making mistakes if internal controls do not work. The best defense against mistakes and fraud are proper internal governance  or checks and balances. Internal dual controls  together with both internal and external auditors  plus a proper disclosure policy would give the best incentives for internal management to perform according to proper rules of behaviour. Public disclosure rather than private channels of information would be cheaper and reduce unwarranted expectations of what a regulator or supervisor can actually achieve. However  it is difficult  if not impossible  to guarantee full disclosure. It is doubtful whether free markets work well enough in conditions where information is partial and asymmetrically distributed and externalities exist. Thus  it is not really possible for the authorities to shift entirely to reliance on disclosure and to abandon their specialised supervisory function. Increasingly  therefore  the public oversight function is one of monitoring and surveillance  to ensure that systemic risks are not incurred at excessive public costs. When best practices and market standards are applied  any behaviour by regulatees that deviate from the norm would be subject to public scrutiny. There is therefore greater pressure for establishing international norms of performance  such as capital adequacy standards and risk management tools. The Basle Committee has recently established “Core Principles” to guide the regulation of banks. The application of certain regulatory tools  such as required capital ratios  exposure limits  constraints on self-dealing and CAMEL ratings are designed to ensure that market participants comply with minimal standards of capital and risk exposures. It should be emphasised that effective regulation requires proper compliance and enforcement. This embodies the idea of “bark versus bite”. Teeth must also include sound exit policies - non-exit implies no enforcement  which is the case of state-owned enterprises in the Mainland of China. However  increasingly it is recognized that such rules should be kept simple and broad-brushed  in order to allow a rule-based environment to function. Too many rules impose too heavy a regulatory cost  with redundant or excessive information burdens. BIS Review 55/1997 - 5 - However  given very rapidly changing market conditions  some degree of discretion can be more practical than rigid rules. On the other hand  excessive discretion can lead to systematic forbearance (time inconsistency) that undermine rules and could even be subject to corruption and abuse. Therefore  the time inconsistency problem can be solved by authorities pre-committing themselves to a sequence of automatic  graduated responses  giving the market time to adjust to rule changes or rule application. However  it must be true that the incentive or pay-off structure is one that must not be overlooked. One of the main reasons why agents do not abide by established control procedures is because it is not in their own perceived interest to do so (Goodhart  1996). The best way to control risks is the market incentive to do so. For the market to work  there must be adequate information transparency  and an adequate pay (or penalty) structure that causes the private sector or market to regulate itself. For example  excessive bonuses may have caused the Barings management to overlook the risks assumed by Leeson. Low pay for internal auditors relative to dealers may prevent them from raising the alarm bell. Internal audit committees of financial institutions should signify that they have considered the implications for the risk preferences of key personnel of their pay structures. It is now better recognized that a robust financial infrastructure is also a form of regulator on market participant behaviour. Modern financial infrastructure  such as automated payment systems  impose on market participants certain minimum standards of performance  such as time compliance in payments. Failure of one participant to perform would immediately expose the participant to market discipline. There is therefore peer pressure on market participants to comply with the standards demanded by international payment systems. Costs of Regulation Regulation is not without costs. The US estimates that regulation costs the consumer roughly 7% of GDP annually  both directly or indirectly. Bank regulation can be likened to deposit insurance - the higher the regulation and safety  the higher the insurance premium. One theory suggests that banks can elect to be one of three categories: super-safe banks  safe or normal. Super-safe banks are only allowed to hold super-safe assets  but in return have 100% deposit insurance. Normal banks are allowed to hold any asset  but depositors get no protection at all. But super-safe assets offer a lower yield than normal assets  so the safer the bank the lower the interest rate offered to the depositors. The cost of regulation lies not only in the cost of preventing bank failure  but also the opportunity costs of foregone innovation. Excessive or outmoded regulation results in loss of international competitiveness  thus imposing future adjustment costs on the economy. Hence  there is a need to review regulations constantly and to de-regulate or re-regulate. Why are we deregulating? There are four major reasons why deregulation is occurring: Globalisation Financial innovation and disintermediation Changing consumer behaviour  e.g. aging population Excessive costs BIS Review 55/1997 - 6 - The globalisation of financial markets can be demonstrated by the tremendous increase in cross-border transactions. For instance  at the end of 1994 the stock of cross-border bank assets was more than 4.5 times its level of 15 years earlier  which represents an increase from 20% of the combined GDP of OECD countries in 1980 to around 35% in 1994. Between 1980 and 1994 cross-border securities transactions in industrial countries expanded from less than 10% of GDP to well above 100% of GDP. Within the equity sector  cross-exchange and cross-border transactions have increased rapidly as a percentage of world equity turnover to the point where one in four stock market trades conducted world-wide involves either a foreign security or a foreign counterparty. The globalisation of financial markets may increase systemic risk  through contagious financial disorders originating in poorly regulated financial centres. As Alan Greenspan (1997) mentioned  ’the efficiency of global financial markets  engendered by the rapid proliferation of financial products  has the capability of transmitting mistakes at a far faster pace throughout the financial system in ways that were unknown a generation ago  and not even remotely imagined in the 19th century.’ Depositors  investors and counterparties may be exposed to foreign jurisdiction risks which they are not in a position to monitor or control. Besides  the co- existence of uneven national regulations and global markets may severely distort competition between financial institutions. The growing integration of markets calls for international cooperation among supervisors. Accordingly  the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision was established in 1974 and is involved in establishing a common regulatory framework. The Basle Committee and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) issued co-ordinated guidelines on risk management on OTC derivatives business. IOSCO also adopted the so-called Windsor Declaration on co-operation between supervisors of futures and options markets. Industry initiatives also aimed at strengthening prudential standards in international financial markets. The Group of Thirty has proposed minimum standards relating to netting arrangements  settlement procedures and managerial oversight of derivatives risks. The International Securities Dealers Association (ISDA) has established good practice guidelines for the management of derivatives and FX business globally by broker-dealers. And in early 1996  49 exchanges and clearing houses announced an agreement to exchange information on their members’ risk exposures in different markets. Another key development in international financial markets is the emergence of financial conglomerates which provides a wide range of services including insurance  securities  mortgage lending and banking services etc.. The fusion of different types of business is made possible by deregulation initiatives in major financial centres. In London  the rules of the Stock Exchange were amended in 1986 to allow acquisition of member firms by outsiders  including banks  thereby ending the separation of banking and securities businesses which had been a feature of the UK financial services industry for some 300 years. In the US  the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 still formally separates banking from securities businesses  but through liberal interpretation of this statute the US regulatory authorities have in recent years permitted the US banks to develop significant securities operations through special-purpose affiliates. Furthermore  there is a widespread consensus within the US that Glass-Steagall should be repealed. In Japan  the Financial System Reform Law that came into effect in 1993 allowed commercial banks and securities firms to expand into each others’ business territory by establishing separate subsidiaries. In the European Union  the capital adequacy directive’s trading-book approach permits banks to engage freely in securities activities. BIS Review 55/1997 - 7 - The revolution in information and data processing technology has transformed our financial markets and the way our financial institutions conduct their operations. In most respects  these technological advances have enhanced the potential for reducing transaction costs  to the benefit of consumers of financial services  and for managing risks. But in many respects they highlight the inadequacies of existing regulations. The ease and cheapness of gathering  processing and disseminating information has encouraged financial innovation in a number of areas  including the development of screen-based trading systems  securitisation and the proliferation of derivative products. One of the regulatory responses to financial conglomerates is the adoption of consolidated supervision. Regulators should consider whether various businesses within a conglomerate (banking  securities  insurance  etc.) should be consolidated in an accounting sense for the purpose of calculating capital adequacy and other prudential ratios  and for assessment in general. The more general view expressed  for instance  in European financial market directives and Basle regulatory guidelines is that like activities should be treated identically for supervisory purposes  regardless of the category of institution. It is also important that bank and securities regulators co-operate at the international level. Financial innovation  e.g. derivatives trading  creates transparency problems for regulators  because of the speed and complexity of risk transformation. The appropriate response of market transparency is more extensive disclosure of financial information. But in the context of fast-moving derivatives business the difficulty is to formulate effective disclosure rules that do more than provide an outdated snapshot of risk exposures. For management of financial institutions  the main emphasis must be on internal controls. External regulators  such as the Basle Committee and IOSCO  have responded and issued detailed guidelines on risk management. As trading position can be transformed swiftly through the use of derivatives and hence may not be reliable  regulatory focus has shifted to assess internal risk models  rather than the instruments held at a point in time. In addition to external regulation  the Group of Thirty in its 1993 study of derivatives made recommendations at strengthening risk-management techniques and procedures. Another industry initiative was JP Morgan’s decision to release its own proprietary risk-management model for general use. In addition  changing consumer behaviour resulting from aging population  for example  calls for new and sophisticated products like pension funds and long-term debt instruments. Also  consumers’ expectations are likely to be higher as they now have access to more choices from more diversified markets. Finally  de-regulation has occurred because old regulations have not prevented the massive losses incurred by worldwide bank failures. In many countries  the losses caused by bank failures have been as high as 15% of GDP  with bank losses in Japan and France at an estimated 8% of GDP. In the light of these heavy costs  governments around the world have begun to look seriously at the cost of regulation. The latest initiative include the Japanese Big Bang  which would be complete by 2000. Should the Central Bank also act as the Supervisor? There are several arguments in support of the assumption of the supervisory role by the central bank. The first is efficiency consideration. There is huge overlap between the areas of interest of  and information required by  and available to  both the supervisor and the central bank. Second  rescue or liquidity crisis will normally involve and require the immediate BIS Review 55/1997 - 8 - provision of liquidity  which can only be done by the central bank. This is facilitated by internalising the supervisory body within the central bank. Others argue the reverse. First  since the finance of any large rescues involves government funding  the politicians have a direct interest and involvement in financial regulation. This may undermine the independence of a central bank if it also plays a supervisory role. Second  it is argued that an independent central bank in its conduct of monetary policy and being responsible for banking supervision may be perceived as too powerful. Third  the failure of a central bank in its supervisory duties will harm its credibility in its conduct of monetary policy. There is an inherent conflict between supervision and monetary policy. Central bank assistance to bail out problem banks tends to be inflationary on the money supply. The arguments are finely balanced. Whether the regulatory power should be centralized or diffused will depend very much on the legal  constitutional and historical background for each financial system. Conclusion Regulation is an art  not a science. It involves complicated trade-offs between competing interests. As Walter Bagehot said over 120 years ago  money will not manage itself. The regulation of money will be debated in the years to come.

Yam  at the ADB-IIF Forum on Developing Asian Financial Markets held in Fukuoka  Japan  on 10/5/97.,Mr. Yam looks at Asian banking in a regional and global context Address by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  Mr. Joseph C.K. Yam  at the ADB-IIF Forum on Developing Asian Financial Markets held in Fukuoka  Japan  on 10/5/97. I am pleased to be here this morning to address you on the subject of Asian banking in a regional and global context. I will be speaking particularly about banks in the East Asia region. The importance of banking stability 2. There is increasing international recognition of the importance of a sound banking system in promoting macroeconomic stability  sustainable economic growth and the efficient intermediation between savings and investment. The last few months have seen a series of initiatives by international financial institutions and groupings to devise principles  standards and strategies for the promotion of financial stability. While these initiatives have been directed principally at emerging markets  they also have application to the more developed markets which have been by no means immune from banking problems in recent years. A number of Asian economies  including Hong Kong  have participated in this work. This is a practical recognition that the setting of international regulatory standards must be a broadly-based process  in keeping with the global nature of today’s financial markets. 3. I do not need to belabour the point about the debilitating and disruptive effects which banking problems can have on economic and monetary management. The need to restore the capital of failed banks can impose a heavy fiscal burden. In many cases this has amounted to 10% or more of GDP. Monetary policy may be side-tracked by the need on the part of the authorities when determining interest rates to take account of the possible implications on banking stability and on other  often more political  policy objectives. 4. Furthermore  in nursing weak banks  the main priority for these banks is likely to be to repair the damage to their balance sheets and they may have little appetite for new lending. This leads to the “credit crunch” phenomenon where even good-quality borrowers find it more difficult to obtain loans when banking stability has been undermined. As the Japanese experience has shown  this weakened ability of banks to lend can frustrate the authorities’ efforts to get the economy moving again after a downturn. The role of bank borrowing in funding growth 5. This possible impairment of the intermediation role of banks would be a particular cause for concern in Asia where the banks have played a substantial role in financing economic growth. By the standards of developed economies  this role for banks in Asia is significantly more important than that of other channels of financial intermediation. This partly reflects the lack of highly developed bond markets in the region  which in itself is also a reflection of the predominance of the banks. 6. Let me digress a little in this connection. There is clear consensus on the need for encouraging the development of bond markets in Asia. Like a number of other central banks  we in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority have taken a number of initiatives in this direction in Hong Kong in recent years. We now have a fairly liquid bond market with a sophisticated but user-friendly market infrastructure. We have also taken initiatives in the regional dimension to promote the networking of Asian bond markets through encouraging bilateral linkages of debt clearing systems. BIS Review 55/1997 - 2 - 7. It is hoped that these efforts could help the expansion of the role of the Asian bond markets and hence facilitate more effective financial intermediation in the domestic  regional and global context. The region’s investment needs over the next decades are huge. The World Bank has estimated that private gross domestic fixed investment will amount to a total of US$ 5 trillion over the ten years to the year 2004  a large part of it associated with infrastructural development1. The share of bonds in financing these needs is projected to grow from only 9% to 26% by 2004. 8. I hope this can be realized for this would enable the banks’ role in Asia to consolidate into more prudent proportions at least in the eyes of the regulators. It would help to achieve a more diversified and therefore a more stable framework for financial intermediation. Indeed  on the World Bank’s projections  the share of bank borrowing is expected to decline commensurately from 40% to 30% over the same period. 9. But turning back to banking in the region  even if this scenario is realized  and there must of course be much uncertainty on this  the amount that banks would be called upon to finance would remain very substantial in absolute terms. For the foreseeable future  therefore  the banks will still be playing a key role in mobilizing savings in the region and channeling this into investment. And this makes it even more important that banking systems in the region remain healthy. Of course  foreign banks will play an important financing role  in particular those based in Hong Kong which is the major centre in the region for the arranging of syndicated loans. But within most of the banking systems of the region it is the local banks which predominate in terms of share of assets. The position of Asian banks 10. So let us take a look at the current position of the Asian banks. It is in fact very difficult to generalize because the banking systems in the region are not homogeneous. But certainly if we look at what the World Bank has called the eight “high performing Asian countries”  the Asian banks have been at the heart of the Asian success story2. This is partly due to the emphasis laid by governments on trying to ensure the stability of banks  through prudential supervision and other means  to encourage confidence among savers. While there have been periods of financial distress in individual banking systems in the region in past years  such incidents have generally been fewer and less severe than in other emerging markets. Asian banks were able to meet the Basle Committee’s recommended 8% minimum capital adequacy ratio with comparative ease. Moreover  despite the fact that barriers to entry in some economies have protected the Asian banks from the full forces of competition  they have managed to survive on lower interest margins and achieve a higher level of operating efficiency than their counterparts in other regions. 11. The Asian banks have of course benefited from operating in the fastest growing region in the world  and one where the macroeconomic environment in terms of GDP growth  inflation and exchange rates has been much less volatile than in  say  Latin America3. More recently  however  growth in some economies in the region has slowed. I hope that this will turn out to be a cyclical  rather than a structural  phenomenon. At any rate  the economic environment is currently somewhat less benign  and this has brought into sharper focus some of the challenges which banks in the region are now facing. 1 2 3 The Emerging Asian Bond Market  World Bank 1995. The East Asian Miracle  World Bank 1993. BIS Annual Report 1996. BIS Review 55/1997 The challenges faced by Asian banks - 3 - 12. Let me attempt to describe what these challenges are. There are obviously many  but I will focus on four main categories  namely: global integration of financial markets; financial liberalization and increased competition; maintenance of asset quality; innovation and technological change. Global integration of financial markets 13. The trend of global integration of financial markets is clear. The increase in capital flows into the emerging markets has been one of the dominant features of the 1990s. During the period 1990-95  inflows into the Asian economies amounted to US$ 360 billion4. The effect of this has been to bind individual economies even more tightly into the global market place. While this has brought major benefits to the recipient economies in terms of encouraging increased investment and development of capital markets  it has also left them more exposed to external shocks and loss of confidence. The macroeconomic instability caused by large-scale inflows and by their subsequent reversal will clearly have an adverse impact on the banking system. The risk of this is less if inflows take the form of more stable longer-term direct investment. To a significant extent  this has been the case for the Asian economies. But for some economies short-term inflows have been relatively large  and there are doubts about their sustainability. 14. Inflows of hot money also create more direct problems for the banks as well as affecting the macroeconomic environment. In particular  they will tend to add to the liquidity of the banking system and encourage expansion of lending. Rapid growth in lending such as we have witnessed in a number of Asian economies can be a warning sign because it tends to be associated with a lowering of credit standards as banks lend to customers whose creditworthiness is more marginal. Moreover  much of this lending may find its way into the property market and stock market  adding to the upward pressure on asset prices arising from the inflows themselves. Reversal of inflows or a slowing down of the economy  as in Thailand  thus exposes the banks to both credit risk and market risk as asset prices fall. 15. With large capital inflows  banks may also find themselves incurring substantial net foreign currency liabilities. They will thus additionally be exposed to substantial foreign exchange risks if the domestic currency weakens. Financial liberalization and increased competition 16. Associated with  and leading to the global integration of financial markets is the trend of financial liberalization and increased competition. The trend has increasingly freed banks from direct controls on interest rates and on their permitted business activities in many Asian economies. We can see this in banking systems as far apart as those in China where the process of commercialization of the banking sector is now underway and in Japan which is planning its own version of Big Bang in the next few years. This new freedom can bring increased opportunities for the banks and can be a powerful incentive to increased efficiency in 4 International Capital Markets  IMF 1996. BIS Review 55/1997 - 4 - the banking sector. But it can also bring new risks if the banks do not use their new freedoms well - in particular if they do not develop the credit skills and risk management techniques which are required in the kind of lending boom that may develop after deregulation. 17. The pressures on the existing banks is increased if liberalization also allows new entrants into the market. Competition in some Asian economies has already intensified as a result of the granting of new domestic banking licences and more liberal policies on the admission of foreign banks. The need to meet WTO obligations will give further impetus to this process. But while the long-term impact on the efficiency of the banking system may be favourable  the short-term impact can be to narrow interest margins and erode franchise value. This can drive the local banks to take on more high risk business. 18. I should stress  however  that the answer to this dilemma is not to stop or reverse the process of deregulation. There are examples around the region of bad debt problems embedded in banks which are either owned by the government or  even if they are privately owned  have been granting policy loans on behalf of the government. Such banks should be encouraged to develop their own credit judgment in order to play an effective role in the process of credit allocation in the economy. So liberalization is the right approach. It must  however  be properly handled if the problems of the banking sector are not to intensify during the transition to a more commercialized system. In particular  the supervisory framework should be strengthened in advance of liberalization. Maintenance of asset quality 19. Let me turn to the challenge of the maintenance of asset quality. This applies across a wide spectrum in Asia from banks that are emerging from tight state control to those that operate on a fully commercial basis. A particular focus of concern  as I have already indicated  is that banks in some economies may have lent too freely to booming property sectors which are now suffering from over-supply. It remains to be seen whether the fears will be realized. A number of supervisory authorities around the region have tried to take measures to limit their banks’ exposure to the property sector. This is a sensible move  though the difficulties of enforcing limits should not be underestimated. 20. However  property lending is not the only problem area. In Korea  for example  the slowdown in export demand in industries such as semiconductors and in economic growth has exposed fragility in those companies which have over-extended themselves by taking on too much debt. Banks which have become used to years of buoyant economic growth may be ill-equipped to deal with these problems. There is also a perception that in some Asian economies the accounting rules and loan classification systems are not telling the whole story about the scale of the bad debt problem. Lack of transparency can result in delay in tackling the problem and erode public confidence in the soundness of the banking system. Innovation and technological change 21. Asset quality is thus one main issue which Asian banks have to tackle. But one of the results of globalization is that even banks in relatively undeveloped banking systems are now having to cope with the challenge of product innovation and new technology. This can accelerate the transformation of such banking systems: modern computer systems can be installed and banks can make the jump straight from cash to smart cards. The downside is that banks may have less time to build up the skills properly to use the new technology and the new products which their counterparts in developed banking systems have taken many years to BIS Review 55/1997 - 5 - acquire. Derivatives are a case in point. While the derivatives markets in the region other than Tokyo are still quite small  these products are certainly being sold to  and in some cases being traded by  local banks in the region; and a number of them have suffered losses as a result. 22. Looking further ahead  the opportunities provided by new technology will pose important strategic challenges for the banks. To what extent  for example  should they invest in new delivery mechanisms such as telephone or internet banking? These channels offer the potential to bring down dramatically the cost of transactions compared with the traditional branch network. Obviously this will depend on the availability of telephone lines and personal computers. There is also the crucial issue of public acceptance of the new technology. Such issues mean that a wholesale shift to electronic banking will not happen overnight. However  banks would be unwise to ignore the longer-term opportunities as well as the threats. If the new delivery mechanisms do develop  this will result in increased competition including from new entrants as barriers to entry are reduced. The potential for foreign banks to provide cross-border banking services  such as private banking  through the internet will also increase. In other words  foreign banks may no longer need to be physically located in a particular country in order to tap its market. This will pose interesting challenges to regulators as well as the banks. The response to the challenges 23. What then should be the response of banks to these challenges? Despite the diversity of banking systems around the Asian region  I think it is possible to draw some broad conclusions. 24. The key point is  I think  for banks to realize that  even if they are state- owned  they are ultimately responsible for their own destiny. The Commercial Banking Law of the People’s Republic of China sums up the point well in its Article 4. To quote an English translation: “A commercial bank operates independently  takes up responsibility for all risks that it may encounter and for its own profits and losses it may bear  and exercises self-regulating mechanisms on the management principle of economic efficiency  safety and liquidity.” 25. What this means is that the board of directors and senior management of banks have the main responsibility to ensure that effective systems of internal governance are in place to plan for the future  to identify and manage the risks to which they are exposed and to control the operations of the bank on a day-to-day basis. I believe that this point is appreciated around the region - from our contacts with fellow supervisors  we know that in many banking systems there is a heightened awareness of the importance of sound risk management. But the difficulty is in turning this into actual changes in behaviour  which requires great efforts to be devoted to the training of staff  for example in credit skills  as well as more fundamental changes in culture in some banks. 26. This change in culture may require some banks to wean themselves off property lending which is sometimes seen as an easy option  given that it is based on collateral and on expectations of ever-rising property values. This can prove to be a fallacy  as the Japanese example shows only too well. Banks need therefore to develop a broadly-based lending business where the borrower’s ability to repay is the first consideration and collateral is there as the second line of defence. More generally  it will usually be sensible for banks to try to diversify their business into areas which offer the ability to earn fee income and thus reduce their BIS Review 55/1997 - 6 - dependence on the interest-rate cycle. I hasten to add  however  that this should only be done if the necessary systems and controls are in place. 27. In some cases  the changes required by banks to meet the challenges of a more competitive environment may be too great for them to meet on their own. Mergers may be required to produce fewer and stronger banks  and I am aware that in some countries this process is being given official encouragement. 28. This points to the fact that the regulators also have their part to play in encouraging the process of change in banks. While the prime responsibility for prudent management of banks does rest with the banks themselves  the authorities do have a role to play in ensuring that effective systems of supervision are in place. These should include incentives to discourage the excessive taking of risk by banks  including that owners should be required to have a significant amount of capital at risk and to bear the losses should a bank fail. The infrastructure of business laws  accounting rules and public disclosure requirements must also be conducive to prudent management and market transparency. Payments systems must be enhanced to reduce the risk of systemic instability. 29. These are all areas where progress is being made throughout the region. I detect few signs of complacency among my fellow regulators or of a tendency to rest on past successes. We all recognize that banking stability is something that requires constant attention to keep up with changes in the economic environment and with market developments. There is also  I believe  a strong appreciation of the need to work together to promote stability. This is shown by the regional initiatives  through groupings such as EMEAP  to promote cooperation in supervision and in other financial sector issues. International institutions such as the Asian Development Bank also have an important role to play in encouraging financial market development. I am sure that this Forum will be helpful in addressing some of the issues involved  and I am grateful to the ADB and the IIF for organizing the event and for giving me the opportunity to speak.

Let me begin with a word of thanks for being invited to talk with you about the Swedish economy and monetary policy. Today I shall be considering three issues. First some words about the construction of monetary policy and why low inflation is a good thing. Then a look at what has happened in the Swedish economy since the crisis culminated in 1993. Finally I shall be saying something about the future outlook for the economy and for monetary policy. 1. Low inflation and economic stability The objective is low inflation The Riksbank conducts monetary policy with a target that is clear and unmistakable: the annual rate of change in the consumer price index is to be kept at 2 per cent  with a tolerance interval of – 1 percentage point. In order to fulfil the target the Riksbank varies its instrumental rate (the repo rate)  which influences the level of economic activity and thereby inflation. Experience has taught us that the time lag before an interest rate adjustment has its full effect on inflation ranges from one to two years. This means that the Riksbank has to operate with a forward-looking perspective - the interest rate must be set in the light of forecast inflation one to two years ahead. The central function of the Riksbank is to achieve price stability or at least keep the rate of price increases low and stable. This approach to monetary policy is based on the insight that in the longer run  higher price increases cannot generate growth and employment. Growth stems from other factors  such as technological advances  the way the economy functions  demographic trends  etc. Attempts to stimulate economic growth by accepting higher inflation soon tend to boomerang. This is clear both from our own experience in recent decades and from what has happened in other countries. The players in the economy adapt to the higher inflation; prices  wages and interest rates rise; the end result is normally an economic trend that is weaker instead of stronger. Throughout the western world today  economic policy is less concerned with “stop and go” policies to influence short-run activity and focuses more on creating good and stable long-term conditions for economic growth and employment. In such an approach  the function of monetary policy is to safeguard the value of money. In the past decade support for a policy of this type has also grown markedly in Sweden. This year’s Spring Economic Bill states that “The overriding task for monetary policy is price stability”. In keeping with this and in order to facilitate the implementation of a credible monetary policy  more and more countries are striving to separate monetary policy decisions from day-to-day policy-making. The latest instance of this comes from Britain  where one of the first things the new government did was relinquish control of interest rate policy to the Bank of England. The harm done by inflation High inflation impairs the workings of the economy. General price increases make it more difficult for households and firms to keep tabs on how the prices of certain goods BIS Review 56/1997 - 2 - and services are moving in relation to others. It then also becomes more difficult for firms to know which products are worth marketing  which investments will pay best and so on. A case in point and one that is certainly familiar to some of you is Sweden’s property boom in the 1980s. The combination of high inflation and the tax system in those days made speculation in real estate profitable. The property market then collapsed in the early 1990s and occasioned huge economic costs. The overheated real estate market had crowded out other  more productive investments and when the bubble burst  finance companies and banks were hit by loan losses at the same time as the ensuing adjustment entailed massive costs in the form of lost production and unemployment. There are also grounds for supposing that low  stable inflation moderates cyclical fluctuations in economic activity. This seems to be the case  at least  in the United States  where since 1982 there have been two long expansionary phases separated by a single  relatively brief downturn. Experience in Sweden points to the same conclusions. The first two post-war decades  for example  when inflation was low  were considerably more stable than the 1970s and 1980s  when inflation was left to rise and there was a series of devaluations  with negative effects on productivity and growth. Moreover  the higher the rate of inflation  the more likely it is that the rate will fluctuate  which accentuates the uncertainty about future inflation. Savers and creditors then require higher compensation for risk: besides compensation for the expected rate of inflation  they will demand a premium for the degree of uncertainty about future inflation. This means higher real interest rates  which weaken the propensity to invest. Furthermore  the more inflation fluctuates and is difficult to forecast  the greater will be its arbitrary and random effects on the distribution of income and wealth. Inflation tends to redistribute from savers and lenders to borrowers  from those with fixed nominal incomes to those who pay such incomes  and so on. Clearly  such arbitrary redistributional effects are hardly in line with a distribution policy based on fairness. 2. Developments since the crisis Several years of good growth Since the upturn from the profound crisis in 1991-93  economic growth in Sweden has averaged 2.8 per cent  which is higher than we were accustomed to in the inflationary 1970s and 1980s. Moreover  the composition of growth has been favourable  with exports and investment predominating (Diagram 1). It should be underscored that this has been accompanied by the lowest level of inflation for decades. The low inflation as such has no doubt helped to make the economy function better. The conditions for a long  stable upswing have improved. Together with clearer price signals  this makes it easier for households and firms to plan and make decisions. The workings of the economy have also been improved by the tax reform  various deregulations and changes to social security systems. Competitive pressure has grown as a result of EU membership and the globalisation of trade. The result is discernible in a higher rate of capital formation and structural changes in the economy. In both 1994 and 1995 GDP growth topped 3 per cent. In 1996 the growth of final demand remained fairly high  2.1 per cent  and the rate accelerated in the second half-year to 2.6 BIS Review 56/1997 - 3 - per cent from the corresponding period the year before. Total production  however  did not match the growth of final demand  the reason being that firms chose to trim stocks. The growth of GDP  which represents total output  stopped at 1.1 per cent in 1996.

It has to do with the tendency to produce in excess of demand when activity is rising so as to avoid being unable to deliver if demand grows rapidly. In time  firms find they have accumulated surplus stocks and initiate an adjustment. This has the reverse effect - production rises more slowly than final demand. Under certain circumstances stock adjustments may trigger a more marked economic slowdown. This may happen  for instance  if effects of the adjustments either spread to private consumption or have a negative impact on the labour market and household confidence. The Riksbank was therefore alert to the risk of private consumption being weaker last spring and summer  which would have pointed to a further curb on inflation. In practice  however  private consumption went on rising in the summer and its growth became somewhat stronger in the autumn. Low inflation and interest rate reductions The rate of inflation decreased during 1996 and the rates that different economic agents expected in the future also moved down markedly (Diagram 2). This enabled the Riksbank to lower the repo rate from 8.91 to 4.10 per cent. As a result  the initial position for the ongoing growth phase in Sweden’s economy is more favourable than for many years. The drop in the rate of consumer price increases was appreciably accentuated by the Riksbank’s repo rate cuts in that these contributed to the reduction of mortgage interest costs. Under normal circumstances the tolerance interval around the price stability target should suffice BIS Review 56/1997 - 4 - to absorb transitory effects on the price level. Last year  however  the fall in interest rates was very marked because many factors had a concerted effect that rapidly altered the picture of inflation. The magnitude of that interest rate fall is also largely responsible for the weak price trend to date in 1997.

Excluding house mortgage interest costs  the current rate of inflation is about 1 percentage point higher than indicated by the CPI. It seems reasonable to conclude  however  that an evaluation of the Riksbank’s policy for inflation must recognise that a part of the changes in the rate of inflation stems from transitory effects occasioned by the Riksbank’s own measures. 3. The current assessment The March inflation report I should now like to turn to the outlook for inflation in the coming years. In order to provide as open and clear a picture as possible of how the Riksbank analyses the future prospect for inflation and approaches the construction of monetary policy  we present reports on this four times a year. In the latest report  published this March  it was considered that the GDP growth rates for 1997 and 1978 would be 2 and 3 per cent  respectively. It was also foreseen that no appreciable capacity restrictions should arise in these years. With an unchanged monetary stance and given that households and firms continue to count on inflation remaining low  underlying domestic inflation (the CPI change excluding transitory effects on inflation) one to two years ahead was judged to be between 1.5 and 2 per cent. In that the transitory effects will be dropping out of the 12-month change figures  however  registered inflation will move up by degrees in 1997 and 1998. In March we counted on the annual rate of inflation in 1997 being around 0.5 per cent  which would still be clearly below the inflation target. We also envisaged that in 1998 inflation would be somewhat below 2 per cent. As we all know  forecasting economic activity and prices is not a simple matter. Since such assessments cannot be very exact  one has to weigh up risks and probabilities. Two secondary alternatives were therefore discussed in the March report  where future inflation might be lower and higher  respectively  than in the main scenario. In the former alternative  lower inflation might result from a weaker development of consumption. In the latter  on the other hand  higher inflation might stem from a weaker exchange rate that leads to higher growth for exports and GDP  thereby generating stronger inflationary pressure. Against this background  I want to say something about our current view of tendencies for private consumption and the exchange rate. Private consumption In 1996 household disposable income fell  unexpectedly  by 0.1 per cent despite a strong increase in the wage bill. The National Institute of Economic Research and many other observers had expected a 2 per cent increase in disposable income. The growth of consumption was therefore financed entirely from a reduction of the saving ratio to 5.4 per cent. This has altered the starting point for assessing private consumption’s future path. BIS Review 56/1997 - 6 - In recent years household income has been greatly affected by measures for consolidating government finance  mainly increased taxes and decreased transfers. But for the impact of public systems  household income in each of the years 1994-98 would have been 3 to 4 per cent higher (Diagram 4). As it is  the level is likely to be virtually unchanged. The withdrawal of household income probably peaked in 1996 but even in the two following years the fiscal stance measured in this way is tight.

One approach is to compare with countries where the economic framework for households resembles that in Sweden. This suggests that both the household net saving ratio and the ratio of total wealth to disposable income are relatively low in Sweden. It then seems unlikely that in a long-term perspective the saving ratio will fall back to the historically low levels in the 1980s (Diagram 5). Leading indicators point to a continuation of private consumption’s upward tendency in the first quarter of 1997. House prices have shown signs of moving in recent months. A growing money supply and lending to the household sector likewise point to a continued increase in consumption. Retail turnover  above all for consumer durables  strengthened in February and March  as is also evident in the March business tendency survey from the National Institute. In the first four months of this year the number of cars newly registered in the household sector rose in annual terms by around 60 per cent. Households have become more optimistic about their own economy; in April a majority envisaged an improvement 12 months ahead. There is no cause at present to modify the main assessment in the inflation report - that consumption will show a stable but by no means dramatic rise in the coming years. But an appreciably weaker development of consumption  which was a prominent component of one of the alternative scenarios  seems to have become somewhat less probable. Exchange rate The Riksbank does not target the exchange rate. The monetary policy target is price stability. But the exchange rate does feature as one important factor in the Riksbank’s assessment of inflation in the coming two years. The exchange rate conditions demand in the economy  particularly in the export sector  and also affects inflation directly in the form of import prices. The latter  more immediate effect is  however  transitory and of secondary interest provided it does not influence inflation expectations and thereby price and wage setting behaviour. An assessment of future inflation therefore requires a forecast or judgement of the exchange rate in the coming two years  yet this is a variable that is notoriously difficult to predict and has fluctuated widely for Sweden since 1992. A natural starting point for this is the current exchange rate together with an estimate of what a reasonable long-term level might be in relation to competitiveness  financial saving  etc. The past six months provides an example of how the argument might go. Since October 1996 the krona’s effective exchange rate has weakened by about 7 per cent. Most of this change stems from the appreciation of sterling and the US dollar against currencies in continental Europe (Diagram 6). Cyclical factors have been at work here; the United States and Britain are leading an upward phase and there have been expectations about future monetary policy that tended to strengthen both their currencies. But the krona has also fallen  particularly during the winter and spring  against most Central European currencies  including the German mark. At times this has had to do with unrest in Europe over the EMU process. Many market observers  however  also point to some uncertainty about the durability of Swedish economic policy. BIS Review 56/1997 - 8 - In the longer run there are good grounds for a stronger krona. Productivity in the Swedish economy has risen rapidly in recent years. The current account shows a large surplus and the expansion of export production should ultimately spread to the domestic sector. The outlook for inflation is favourable and government finance shows a considerable improvement. Still  there is reason to take the weakening of the krona seriously. Policy must continue to focus on consolidating government finance; budgetary improvements in connection with strong economic activity cannot be used for easing the fiscal stance. Under these circumstances  neither are there grounds as regards the exchange rate for appreciably modifying the March assessment. To date in 1997  however  the krona has been somewhat weaker than envisaged and this  together with the available indicators  points to marginally higher export growth. All in all  today there is no reason to revise the overall picture of the economy and inflation that was presented in the March inflation report. The tendencies to date seem to broadly confirm the assessments there. Various forward indicators suggest that the Swedish economy is again entering a period of increased growth. At the same time  most things point to price increases remaining low this year and next  which is the period we can assess at present. The repo rate was lowered most recently last December. Since then we have frequently declared that the monetary stance is well balanced. This still applies. BIS Review 56/1997

Meyer  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the Conference on Small Business Finance held at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business  Berkley Center for Entrepreneurial Studies and New York University Salomon Center in New York on 23/5/97. It is a pleasure to be here to meet with you at New York University for this Conference on Small Business Finance. It is clear from the conference program that there is an excellent mix of academics  government representatives  and practitioners here to study how small business is financed. Indeed  I am glad to see so much attention being paid to this important topic. Small business is a vital and energetic part of our economy that plays a key role in the generation of jobs  new ideas  and the encouragement of entrepreneurial activity. Without doubt  a thriving small business sector contributes to the well-being of our nation. Today  I would like to share with you some thoughts about the role of banks in supplying credit to small business. The part played by banks in small business finance is not a new topic for the Federal Reserve. In fact  for many years we have been devoting substantial resources to collecting and analyzing data on small business finance generally  and the credit supplied by banks in particular. We collect data from small businesses on how they obtain financing -- or in some cases fail to obtain financing -- using the National Survey of Small Business Finance and the Survey of Consumer Finances. We also gather information directly on the small business credit extended by individual commercial banks. We have collected information on the contract terms of bank loans to both small and large businesses since 1977 through the Survey of Terms of Bank Lending to Business. Since 1993  the banking agencies have required all commercial banks to report their quantities of loans to businesses by size of loan on the June Call Reports. Lastly  as part of revised Community Reinvestment Act procedures  the banking agencies have just this year begun to collect data on small business loans by local geographic area. When these data become available  they should prove to be a rich source of new information. A number of economists have used the existing data in research that has helped us to better understand the potential effects on the supply of small business credit of public policies regarding bank mergers and acquisitions  financial modernization  and prudential supervision may be reducing the supply of credit to small business  since larger banking institutions tend to devote smaller proportions of their assets to small business lending. Solid economic research applying modern econometric techniques to accurate data is needed to evaluate such claims and to determine the likely effects of policy actions in order to improve future policy decisions. The Importance of the Bank-Small Business Relationship According to our survey information  commercial banks are the single most important source of external credit to small firms. Small businesses rely on banks not just for a reliable supply of credit  but for transactions and deposit services as well. Because of their needs for banking services on both the asset and liability sides of their balance sheets  small businesses typically enter into relationships with nearby banks. The data show  for example  that 85 percent of small businesses use the services of a commercial bank within 30 miles of their firm  and that small businesses typically obtain multiple different services from their local bank. The 30 miles actually overstates the distance that small businesses are willing to travel for most of their basic financial services. For example  the median distances from a small business’ offices to the BIS Review 57/1997 - 2 - institutions where it obtains deposit  credit  or financial management services are all 5 miles or less. One of the reasons why the banking relationship is so important to small business finance is that banks can efficiently gain valuable information on a small business over the course of their relationship  and then use this information to help make pricing and credit decisions. The financial conditions of small firms are usually rather opaque to investors  and the costs of issuing securities directly to the public are prohibitive for most small firms. Thus  without financial intermediaries like banks it would simply be too costly for most investors to learn the information needed to provide the credit  and too costly for the small firm to issue the credit itself. Banks  performing the classic functions of financial intermediaries  solve these problems by producing information about borrowers and monitoring them over time  by setting loan contract terms to improve borrower incentives  by renegotiating the terms if and when the borrower is in financial difficulty  and by diversifying the risks across many small business credits. Some recent empirical research suggests that this characterization of the bank-small business borrower relationship is accurate. For example  as the relationship matures  banks typically reduce the interest rates charged and often drop the collateral requirements on small business loans. In short  the bank-borrower relationship appears to be an efficient means for overcoming information and cost problems in small firm finance  and for allowing fundamentally creditworthy small firms to finance sound projects that might otherwise go unfunded. One implication of the importance of the bank-small business relationship is that it may impose limits on the migration of small business finance out of the banking sector. Over the last two decades  many large business loans left the banking sector as improvements in information technology  increased use of statistical techniques in applied finance  and the globalization of financial markets have allowed nonbank and foreign bank competitors to gain market share over U.S. banks. For example  over the 1980s and first half of the 1990s  the share of total U.S. nonfarm  nonfinancial corporate debt held by U.S. banks fell by about one-quarter from 19.6 percent to 14.5 percent. Banks compensated somewhat for these on-balance sheet reductions in a variety of ways. Many banks expanded their participation in off-balance sheet back-up lines of credit  standby letters of credit  and the securitization and sale of some large loans. Other adaptations included a shift in focus toward fee-based services and derivatives activities. The types of developments that might similarly reduce bank market share in small business lending are proceeding rather slowly at present  but may accelerate in the future. Improvements in analytical and information technologies such as credit scoring may decrease the cost of lending to small businesses and make it easier for nonbank lenders to enter this market. These developments are already contributing to more competition for small business loans within the banking industry and between bank and nonbank lenders. Similarly  a significant secondary market for securitization of loans to some small businesses may develop in the future. Those small businesses among current bank borrowers whose information problems are the least severe -- that is  those that are the least informationally opaque -- would presumably be the most likely to be funded outside of the banking system. Nevertheless  no matter how many advances there are in information processing and no matter how sophisticated financial markets may become  there will likely remain a significant role for bank-borrower relationship lending to solve the information and other BIS Review 57/1997 - 3 - financing problems of small businesses. That is  in the foreseeable future it seems very likely that there will remain many small business borrowers with sufficient problems that only bank information gathering  monitoring  and financing can overcome  although this group of borrowers will almost surely differ somewhat from current relationship borrowers. As technology and markets improve to the point that some relatively transparent small business borrowers can be financed outside the bank  other  more opaque potential borrowers that previously had information and other problems too serious for even a bank loan will enter the bank intermediation process. Put another way  the relationship lending process will fund small business borrowers with increasingly difficult information problems as the technology for resolving these problems improves. In my view  this should only increase the efficiency and the competitiveness of small business finance. For example  the improved ability of banks to lend to more opaque borrowers should provide some increased competition for the venture capitalists and angel financiers that were discussed at the conference yesterday. The value of gathering information through the relationship between banks and small businesses also bodes well for the survival of small community-based banks that tend to specialize in these relationships. Most forecasts of the future of the U.S. banking industry predict that thousands of small banks will survive. I hasten to point out that these are not my personal forecasts. I stick to predicting interest rates  GDP growth  and inflation -- items over which I have more control and inside information -- and I leave the banking forecasts to others! But the forecast of thousands of small banks continuing to operate and do well makes sense to me. They have information advantages  knowhow  and local community orientations that are hard to duplicate in large organizations. The importance of relationship lending to small business also raises prudential concerns about bank risk taking. When a bank fails  the losses to society exceed the book values involved because of the loss of the value of the bank’s customer relationships. Even if small business borrowers are able to find financing after their bank fails  it may be at a higher interest rate and with additional collateral requirements until the new bank has had a chance to learn about the borrower’s condition and prospects. When many banks fail during a crisis  this can create a credit crunch or significant reduction in the supply of credit to bank-dependent small business borrowers. For example  research on the Great Depression suggests that the loss of bank-borrower relationships in the 1930s may have deepened and prolonged the economic downturn. More recently  it appears that the weak capital positions of many banks in the late 1980s and early 1990s  not to mention the outright failure of over 1 100 banks during this period  contributed importantly to the sharp slowdown in bank commercial lending during the early 1990s. While the ability of small businesses to find alternative sources of funds is considerably greater today than in the 1930s  and will likely be even greater in the future than it was in the early 1990s  such arguments do reinforce the importance of the connection between macroeconomic and bank supervisory policy. Financial Modernization and Bank Small Business Lending In the remainder of my remarks  I will touch on three additional concerns about the potential effects of financial modernization on the supply of bank credit to small business. I will first discuss the effects of increases in market concentration created by bank mergers and acquisitions within a local market; second  the effects of consolidation of the banking industry as a whole; and third  the possible impacts of the increased complexity of financial service firms in which banking and other organizations may provide a multitude of traditional banking and nonbanking services. BIS Review 57/1997 - 4 - At the outset  I would emphasize that the overriding public policy concern regarding these issues is not the quantity of small business lending  but rather economic efficiency. If some banks are issuing loans to finance negative net present value projects  then such loans should be discouraged. If consolidation of the banking industry or the increased complexity of financial services firms reduces such lending  then economic efficiency is promoted by freeing up those resources to be invested elsewhere  even though the supply of small business credit to these borrowers is reduced. Similarly  a lack of competition or poor corporate control may currently be keeping some positive net present value loans from being made. If modernization increases the supply of loans to creditworthy small business borrowers to pursue financially sound projects  then economic efficiency is also raised as the supply of credit to these small businesses rises. Antitrust analysis in banking has typically been based on the concentration of bank deposits in local markets like Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) or non-MSA rural counties. Under the traditional “cluster approach ” small business loans and other products are assumed to be competitive on approximately the same basis as bank deposits in local markets. While on-going technological and institutional changes seem likely to erode the usefulness of this assumption over time  evidence continues to generally support this assumption. As I noted earlier  small businesses typically get their loans and other financial services from a local bank. Additional research finds that the concentration of the local banking market is a key determinant of the rates that are charged on small business loans. For example  it is estimated that small business borrowers in the most concentrated markets pay rates about 50 to 150 basis points higher than those in the least concentrated markets. This exceeds estimates of the effects of local market concentration on retail deposit rates of about 50 basis points. Research has also suggested that high local-market deposit concentration may lead to reduced managerial efficiency  as the price cushion provided by market power allows a “quiet life” for managers in which relatively little effort is required to be profitable. Managers in these concentrated markets may choose to work less hard or pursue their own personal interests because the lower rates on deposits and higher rates on small business loans raise profits enough to cover for inefficient or self-serving practices. These findings support the need to maintain competition in local banking markets to deter the exercise of market power in pricing consumer deposits and small business loans  and to ensure that the local banks are under sufficient competitive pressure that they are operated in a reasonably efficient way. When bank mergers and acquisitions involve banks operating in different local markets  the issues raised are typically quite different from those I have just discussed. Since the late 1970s  states have been liberalizing laws that previously restricted mergers and acquisitions between banks in different local markets  including allowing holding company acquisitions across state lines. The U.S. banking industry has responded strongly and has been consolidating at a rapid rate over the last 15 years. Consolidation has picked up even more in the first half of the 1990s -- each year bank mergers have involved about 20 percent of industry assets. This trend is likely to continue or accelerate under the Riegle-Neal Act  which has already allowed increased interstate banking  and which will allow interstate branching into almost all states this summer. Importantly  an increase in local market concentration is not a major issue in most of these mergers and acquisitions  as they are primarily of the market-extension type. As such  these consolidations  and sometimes merely the threat of such actions  may be pro-competitive BIS Review 57/1997 - 5 - and reduce the market power of local banks over depositors and small business borrowers in the markets that are invaded. They may also improve the diversification and efficiency of the consolidating institutions. Research generally suggests that most mergers and acquisitions  by improving diversification  allow the consolidating institutions to make more loans and improve their profit efficiency. Mostly as a result of these mergers and acquisitions  the mean size of banking organizations has approximately doubled in real terms in the last 15 years. As I mentioned earlier  a frequently voiced concern about this consolidation is whether the supply of credit to small business may be decreased  since larger banking institutions tend to devote smaller proportions of their assets to small business lending. To illustrate  banks with under $100 million in assets devote about 9 percent of their assets to small business lending on average  whereas banks with over $10 billion in assets invest only about 2 percent of assets in these loans. While such a simplistic analysis may sound appealing on the surface  it is clearly incomplete. It neglects the fundamental nature of mergers and acquisitions as dynamic events that may involve significant changes in the business focus of the consolidating institutions. That is  banks get involved in mergers and acquisitions because they want to do something different  not simply behave like a larger bank. The simplistic comparison of the lending patterns of large and small banks also ignores the reactions of other lenders in the same local markets. Other existing or even new local banks or nonbank lenders might pick up any profitable loans that are no longer supplied by the consolidated banking institutions. These other institutions may also react to M&As with their own dynamic changes in focus that could either increase or decrease their supplies of small business loans. Thus  even if merging institutions reduce their own supplies of small business loans substantially  the total supply of these loans in the local market need not decline. There have been a number of recent studies of these dynamic effects of bank mergers and acquisitions  some of which we heard about this morning. The results suggest that the dynamic effects of mergers and acquisitions are much more complex and heterogenous than would be suggested by the increased sizes of the consolidating institutions alone. For example  mergers of small and medium-sized banks appear to be associated with increases in small business lending by the merging banks  whereas mergers of large banks may be associated with decreases in small business lending by the participants. On average  mergers appear to reduce small business lending by the participants  but this decline appears to be offset in part or in whole by an increase in lending by other banks in the same local market. These other banks may pick up profitable loans that are dropped by merging institutions  or otherwise have dynamic reactions that increase their supplies of small business lending. Moreover  these results do not include the potential for increased lending by nonbank firms. The bottom line is that small business loan markets seem to work quite well. Creditworthy borrowers with financially sound projects seem to receive financing  although they sometimes have to bear the short-term switching costs  such as temporarily higher loan rates and collateral requirements  of changing banks after their institutions merge. On-going technological change in small business lending should only help to improve the efficiency of this process. Again  I would emphasize that it is not the quantity of small business loans supplied that is most important  but rather the economic efficiency with which the market chooses which small businesses receive credit. To the extent that mergers and acquisitions are pro-competitive and improve corporate control and efficiency  the supply of credit to some BIS Review 57/1997 - 6 - borrowers with negative net present value projects may be reduced  as it should be. That is  the protection from competition provided by interstate and intrastate barriers may have allowed some firms with market power to be inefficient or make uneconomic loans. Similarly  any improvement in competition and efficiency may increase the supply of credit to borrowers with positive net present value projects that inefficient lenders previously did not fund. In either of these cases  economic efficiency is improved. As promised  the final issue I will discuss is that aspect of the modernization of financial markets in which financial service firms are likely to become more complex  providing more types of financial services within the same organization. At the present time  we do not know if and when the Glass-Steagall Act will be repealed  whether nontraditional activities will be provided by bank subsidiaries or bank holding company affiliates  and in which activities banking organizations will be allowed to engage or choose to engage. However  similar to the arguments regarding consolidation of the banking industry  concern is sometimes expressed that small business borrowers may receive less credit from these larger  more complex financial institutions. There is much less research evidence available regarding the potential effects on small business lending of this type of financial modernization than there is about the consolidation of the banking industry  so my remarks here are substantially more speculative. However  I believe there are several reasons for optimism regarding adequate supplies of services to creditworthy small businesses. First  a limited amount of research suggests that there is little if any effect of the current organizational complexity of U.S. banks on their treatment of small businesses  other things equal. In particular  banking organizations with multiple layers of management  those that operate in multiple states  those with Section 20 securities affiliates  and those with other organizational complexities tend to charge about as much for small business credit as other banks of their same size. Second  the research results for the consolidation of banks alone suggest that if profitable loans are dropped by the newer universal-like banks  other small banks or nonbank firms will be standing by to pick up these loans. Finally  the additional insurance  securities underwriting  or other financial services provided by the new institutions should provide greater opportunities for small businesses to have access to these nontraditional services. I want to leave time for questions  so let me conclude with a few summary comments. It is gratifying to see all of this attention being paid to the financing of small business  which is a vital part of our economy  and the Federal Reserve is working actively to stay abreast of the issues with its data collection and research efforts. Small businesses tend to rely on banks for their credit needs and other financial services  and relationships between banks and small businesses are important and efficient means of distributing these services. While technological and institutional changes are and undoubtedly will in the future affect these relationships  it seems unlikely that the core bank-small business relationship will be replaced. The continued heavy dependence of small businesses on local banks also suggests an on-going need for bank supervisors to be sensitive to antitrust issues when considering mergers and acquisitions of banks in the same local market. In contrast  cross-market mergers rarely raise antitrust concerns; indeed  such mergers can be quite pro-competitive. Finally  while some observers have argued that banking consolidation and other aspects of the modernization of the banking industry and financial markets raise concerns about the supply of credit to small business  the market for small business loans in fact seems to work rather well. If there is a merger or other event that reduces the supply of profitable loans to small businesses  other banks seem to step in and provide this credit  and there is every reason to expect that such responses will continue in the future.

Roth s’interroge sur les implications de l’Union monétaire pour la Suisse Exposé présenté par M. Jean-Pierre Roth  Vice-président de la Direction générale de la Banque nationale suisse  à l’Assemblée générale de l’Association Suisse d’Assurances à Genève  le 27/5/97. 1. Introduction Selon le calendrier du Traité de Maastricht  le processus d’intégration monétaire en Europe entre maintenant dans sa dernière ligne droite. D’ici moins d’un an  la liste des pays qui participeront à la première phase d’intégration sera arrêtée et  au 1er janvier 1999  le Système européen de banques centrales (SEBC) prendra la conduite des opérations monétaires. L’euro deviendra alors réalité. Le projet est très ambitieux  non seulement sur le plan politique  mais aussi sur le plan technique. Les pays membres de l’Union Européenne (UE) y travaillent d’arrache-pied depuis le début des années nonante. Leurs efforts visent non seulement à mettre en place une monnaie unique de qualité qui pourra dignement succéder aux devises européennes les plus saines actuellement  mais aussi à donner à l’Europe les moyens de mener une politique commune générant confiance et stabilité. Mon propos  aujourd’hui  ne sera pas de discuter les avantages et les inconvénients d’une unification monétaire en Europe. Ce ne sera pas non plus de tenter de définir le contour géographique de la future zone euro. Sur ces points  suffisamment a été dit et écrit. Vous êtes en possession des éléments du problème. Je souhaite consacrer le temps que vous m’accordez à faire d’abord le point des préparatifs techniques  puis à m’interroger sur les conséquences de l’apparition de la monnaie unique pour les Européens et pour la Suisse. 2. L’état des préparatifs Les travaux préparatoires en vue de la première phase d’intégration monétaire sont de deux ordres: D’une part  des efforts considérables sont déployés au niveau national en vue de remplir les critères de convergence fixés par le Traité de Maastricht. D’autre part  des travaux importants de planification sont nécessaires préalablement à l’introduction de la monnaie unique et à la conduite de la politique monétaire commune. Si les questions relatives aux critères de convergence sont largement connues du public  celles qui se rapportent aux préparatifs monétaires opérationnels le sont moins. Elles sont pourtant d’une importance vitale  car si elles ne sont pas résolues la zone euro ne pourra pas fonctionner correctement. Par ailleurs  pour ceux qui  comme nous  resteront à l’écart du processus  les éléments techniques comportent une dimension pratique évidente. Je m’arrêterai sur les travaux préparatoires relatifs: - à la politique monétaire commune  - aux opérations du SEBC  - au système des paiements  - aux relations avec les tiers. 2.1. La politique commune actuelles - généralement mises en place au 19e siècle - une monnaie unique gérée en commun. L’objectif de l’UEM est de substituer aux monnaies européennes BIS Review 57/1997 - 2 - Aucun projet monétaire d’une telle envergure n’a été réalisé au cours de ce siècle en Europe. Le projet est d’une extraordinaire ambition car il s’agit d’un pari sur l’avenir. Depuis que l’étalon-or n’est plus à la base de nos systèmes monétaires  la monnaie est avant tout une affaire de confiance dans la capacité des autorités à la gérer de telle sorte que son pouvoir d’achat ne s’érode pas. La grande audace de l’UE est de confier le destin de sa monnaie à une autorité qui n’existe pas encore  donc qui n’a pas de crédibilité acquise à l’épreuve de combats passés. Le risque est ici d’autant plus grand que la révolution monétaire  qui se déroulera sous nos yeux  ne sera pas accompagnée d’une révolution politique qui serait en mesure  d’ores et déjà  de rendre claires les axes de développement et les priorités futurs. Conscients de cette déficience de crédibilité  les Européens ont fixé très précisément les objectifs de l’action du SEBC. Ce dernier devra assurer la stabilité des prix  un mandat qu’il aura à remplir en toute indépendance par rapport aux pouvoirs politiques. De plus  grâce aux critères de Maastricht  seuls des pays ayant démontré leur stabilité financière pourront faire partie de l’Union  ce qui doit donner un avant-goût de la culture qui existera au sein du Conseil des gouverneurs de la future autorité monétaire européenne. Tout a donc été prévu pour donner au SEBC la crédibilité indispensable à l’application d’une politique visant à la stabilité des prix. Evidemment  cette question n’est pas seulement théorique  elle est également d’une grande portée économique pour les pays qui entreront dans l’Union. Si la crédibilité des autorités européennes est inférieure à celle des autorités monétaires nationales actuelles  le taux d’intérêt européen aura tendance à être supérieur aux taux que l’Europe connaît aujourd’hui  ce qui pourrait avoir un impact négatif sur le développement de la conjoncture. Le maintien d’un processus cohérent d’intégration est donc crucial pour le “standing” futur de la monnaie européenne  mais surtout pour les conditions de financement et d’investissement dans les pays qui passeront à la fusion monétaire. 2.2. La planification opérationnelle Au-delà des questions essentielles liées à la politique monétaire  les Européens doivent également régler nombre de détails techniques pour être en mesure de gérer en commun le nouvel ensemble monétaire. Ils ont dû s’entendre sur la stratégie et le cadre opérationnel qui seront ceux du SEBC à partir du 1er janvier 1999. traditionnel le monétarisme Comme déjà indiqué  l’objectif de la politique monétaire du SEBC sera la stabilité des prix. Pour l’atteindre  les autorités monétaires suivront une stratégie qui se situera à mi-chemin entre - à l’anglaise - d’objectifs d’inflation. Ces réflexions ont été faites au sein de l’Institut Monétaire Européen (IME)  le précurseur de la Banque centrale européenne. Il est naturel que l’IME n’ait pas été en mesure d’arrêter une stratégie unique pour l’instant. Bien des éléments d’appréciation lui échappent encore: une approche à l’allemande ne pourra être suivie que si la future demande d’euros est suffisamment stable. Si celle-ci ne peut être mise en rapport direct avec l’activité économique dans l’Union monétaire  une stratégie alternative  comme une stratégie basée sur des objectifs d’inflation  pourrait devenir une bonne solution de rechange. l’allemande - et fixation - à la On notera au passage qu’une stratégie de cours de change a été écartée d’emblée. Par une stratégie de change  les Européens pourraient décider de lier le sort de l’euro à celui d’une autre monnaie - le dollar dans notre cas. Ici des éléments politiques et psychologiques me paraissent importants: si l’Europe veut mettre en place une monnaie commune qui puisse faire contrepoids - à terme - au billet vert  il lui est difficile de la faire tenir sur les fonds baptismaux par un parrain américain. Par ailleurs  comme la politique de change ne relèvera pas de la compétence du SEBC mais du Conseil européen  l’autonomie des autorités monétaires serait BIS Review 57/1997 - 3 - d’entrée gravement compromise; en effet  leur marge de manoeuvre dans la gestion de la liquidité du marché de l’euro serait sous la coupe des fluctuations du dollar. Au-delà des questions stratégiques  l’IME a dû régler une foule de détails techniques afin de permettre au SEBC de mener son action monétaire. Ainsi  est-il déjà clair que la liquidité du marché sera gérée par voie d’open-market  que deux taux d’intérêt officiels seront publiés  l’un - un taux de dépôt - constituera une sorte de plancher pour les taux du marché monétaire  l’autre - une forme de taux lombard - jouera le rôle de plafond. La gestion des facilités de crédit et de dépôt relèvera des compétences nationales  alors que l’open-market sera mené par la banque centrale européenne. Une particularité du dispositif européen sera la présence de réserves obligatoires ou  plus précisément  la possibilité d’imposer de telles réserves. La question de l’utilité d’un tel instrument ne fait pas l’unanimité dans les banques centrales de l’UE  le SEBC pourra en faire usage s’il s’avère nécessaire de régulariser la demande de liquidité des banques. 2.3. Le système de paiement Un volet très important des travaux préparatoires est celui de la mise en place d’un système européen de paiements interbancaires par voie électronique. Pourquoi est-ce si important? Parce qu’il est nécessaire que les marchés nationaux soient de véritables vases communicants. Si la banque centrale européenne injecte de la liquidité dans un marché  celle-ci doit pouvoir se distribuer ensuite - très rapidement - dans les autres. De même  si un marché recherche de la liquidité  l’appoint devra pouvoir être immédiatement fourni par les autres grâce à des opérations d’arbitrage. Il n’existera alors qu’un seul taux d’intérêt pour des transactions devant être exécutées en “valeur le même jour”. Dans ce domaine c’est également une révolution qui se prépare car  actuellement  chaque pays de l’UE possède son propre système de paiement interbancaire. Une harmonisation et une coordination sont donc nécessaires. Au plan de l’harmonisation  il est prévu que les systèmes fonctionneront selon des principes de règlement analogues. Au plan de la coordination  il s’agit de connecter ces systèmes afin qu’ils puissent ensuite permettre aux paiements de passer  sans obstacle ni perte de temps  d’un pays à l’autre. Ces domaines sont extrêmement techniques et réclament des investissements considérables. On ne peut s’arrêter sur les questions de paiement sans parler des préparatifs en matière de billets de banque. Ici  l’objectif est plus lointain puisque les billets libellés en euros n’apparaîtront pas avant 2002. Un concours a été organisé  un graphiste choisi. Les travaux de finalisation  puis d’impression  des coupures occuperont largement les trois années qui sépareront 1999 de 2002. 2.4. Les relations avec les pays extérieurs A côté des préparatifs de politique monétaire et de la mise en place du cadre technique  les Européens ont dû arrêter également une stratégie pour leurs relations extérieures. Peu de choses sont connues pour l’instant. Il est déjà clair  toutefois  que les relations entre la zone euro et le reste de l’UE - ceux que l’on appelle les “outs” -  seront d’une importance primordiale. N’oublions pas que l’Union monétaire se déroulera en phases  si bien que la nature des relations entre les membres de l’Union et les pays qui n’ont pas encore voulu - ou pu - adhérer à la zone euro est particulièrement importante  non seulement pour les pays candidats  mais aussi pour les membres de l’Union. A ce stade  une seule chose semble BIS Review 57/1997 - 4 - claire: les pays ne participant pas à la première phase d’intégration ne pourront bénéficier des facilités de crédit du SEBC; le privilège de la liquidité en euro sera réservé aux pays membres. Mais c’est bien entendu dans le domaine des changes que des dispositions spéciales devront être prises. Aujourd’hui  la majeure partie des pays de l’UE font partie du Système Monétaire Européen (SME) et de son Mécanisme de Change (MCE). Demain  lorsque certains membres auront décidé de lier définitivement leurs monnaie  les conditions de fonctionnement du MCE devront être révisées. Il s’agira de mettre la zone euro à l’abri de manipulations monétaires extérieures et d’aider les pays en attente d’intégration à réaliser à leur tour la fusion monétaire. Enfin  la Banque centrale européenne devra également considérer que d’autres pays européens  non-membres de l’UE  souhaiteront établir des relations particulières entre leur monnaie et l’euro. Certains pays d’Europe centrale ont déjà indiqué qu’ils pourraient envisager de lier leur monnaie à l’euro. Qu’en est-il de notre pays  lui qui pourrait se trouver  demain  au coeur de la zone monétaire européenne? 3. Les implications pour la Suisse Que pouvons-nous attendre de l’Union monétaire? Je l’ai déjà indiqué  c’est une révolution qui se prépare à notre porte. Avec l’Union monétaire  le paysage macro-économique européen va être profondément modifié. D’un espace à devises multiples  à marchés financiers fragmentés  on va passer à une zone uniforme dont la dimension potentielle est comparable à celle des Etats-Unis. Le bouleversement sera si profond que chacun d’entre nous  même dans sa vie courante  en percevra les conséquences. Quelles sont les évolutions qui peuvent être pressenties: - au niveau des entreprises  - au niveau macro-économique? 3.1. L’impact de l’euro au niveau des entreprises Avec l’apparition de l’euro  le terme “grand marché” appliqué souvent au marché européen aura pris toute sa signification. Au sein de la zone euro  les risques de change auront disparu  les coûts et les prix seront formulés dans une unité commune  le coût du capital sera identique. De cette constatation banale découleront d’importantes conséquences industrielles: En premier lieu  l’unification monétaire encouragera les entreprises européennes à aller encore plus loin dans leurs investissements transfrontières. La localisation des lieux de production s’effectuera plus rationnellement qu’aujourd’hui en fonction des conditions-cadre locales. Un rôle essentiel joueront ainsi des facteurs comme le coût du travail  la situation fiscale  l’état des communications et la proximité des marchés. Les barrières monétaires disparaîtront: plus d’incertitudes monétaires sur les marges  plus d’incertitudes monétaires sur le rendement des investissements; tous les bilans seront aisément consolidables en euros. Nous allons donc assister à l’apparition d’entreprises à profil plus européen que français ou allemand. Elles seront peut-être multiculturelles dans la langue - pour autant que l’anglais ne devienne pas la langue véhiculaire de l’Europe continentale - mais très “grand marché” dans leur organisation. Il en résultera forcément une unification progressive des techniques et des procédures; peu à peu  s’installera une mentalité de marché intérieur qui  BIS Review 57/1997 - 5 - comme on l’observe aux Etats-Unis  débouchera sur une inflexibilité  une incompréhension à l’égard des marchés extérieurs de faible taille. Pour la Suisse  cela signifie que les règles du jeu commercial deviendront plus difficiles. Les pratiques européennes en matière de contrats  de conditions  de normes  s’imposeront à nous. Il sera toujours plus difficile d’utiliser le franc suisse comme base de facturation  c’est l’euro qui deviendra la référence pour nos exportateurs. Sur le plan interne  le touriste européen qui transitera par notre pays souhaitera payer en euro dans les commerces  plutôt que devoir passer par le franc suisse. Nous devons donc nous préparer à vivre avec un ensemble européen monolithique alors qu’aujourd’hui nous sommes confrontés à une mosaïque aux couleurs très variées. Jusqu’ici le commerce transfrontière était une tradition européenne  demain il le sera moins. En second lieu  la création de la zone euro stimulera la concurrence dans les marchés des produits financiers. C’est certainement dans ce secteur que la suppression des risques de change aura l’impact le plus marqué. Le marché financier européen gagnera en profondeur  il attirera aussi les opérateurs étrangers. La compétition entre les établissements de crédit  entre tous les établissements financiers  s’accentuera même si des particularités nationales subsisteront en matière de surveillance ou dans le domaine fiscal. Il faut donc s’attendre à ce que l’apparition de l’euro entraîne une accélération des ajustements des structures financières. Ici également  le cadre de référence ne pourra plus être national; il deviendra supranational. Cet ajustement des structures est déjà largement engagé dans notre pays. En raison de l’étroitesse de notre marché  nos principaux établissements financiers - banques et assurances - ont déjà été conduits à adopter des stratégies globales. Je crois donc que nous serons ainsi bien en mesure de saisir les chances qui nous seront offertes par le “grand marché financier” de l’euro. Pour conclure cette section sur les services financiers  il convient de parler des services de paiement. Dans ce domaine  notre situation est semblable à celle des pays européens qui ne participeront pas à la première phase d’intégration monétaire. Nous disposons en Suisse d’un système de paiement électronique et de transfert des titres très performant et totalement conforme aux principes retenus par les Européens. Il conviendra d’établir les ponts nécessaires pour que ce système puisse “dialoguer” avec le système européen. Sur ce plan  la situation de la Suisse n’est pas très différente de celle du Royaume-Uni. Les Européens n’ont pas encore défini dans le détail les règles de collaboration dans ce domaine entre les “ins” et les “outs”  les membres et les non-membres de l’Union monétaire. Lorsque cela sera fait  nous verrons quelles sont les variantes qui peuvent être envisagées. Il est indéniable que la monnaie unique créera  dans les relations entre la Suisse et l’Union européenne  un nouveau rapport de forces. Je ne doute pas que nous puissions le gérer  même que nous puissions en exploiter les éléments positifs. Cela réclamera toutefois des prises de risques dans des domaines où nous avons bénéficié de situations fort confortables par le passé. Cela réclamera aussi une volonté de s’adapter à un environnement nouveau  une remise en question de notre manière de commercer avec nos voisins. Il faudra chercher à innover plutôt qu’à optimiser. 3.2. L’impact de l’euro au niveau macro-économique L’apparition de l’euro modifiera aussi l’environnement macro-économique dans lequel opère notre pays. Arrêtons-nous tout d’abord sur les effets de long terme. BIS Review 57/1997 - 6 - Fondamentalement  si les Européens gagnent leur pari  si l’euro s’avère être une monnaie saine  la Suisse bénéficiera d’un environnement européen beaucoup plus stable que par le passé. Jusqu’ici  notre économie a souvent dû s’adapter douloureusement aux distorsions créées par les désordres monétaires extérieurs. A titre d’exemple  rappelons-nous les mouvements spectaculaires de la lire italienne au cours des quinze dernières années. Dans les années quatre-vingt  la lire  intégrée au SME  ne cessait de s’apprécier en termes réels face au franc suisse  ce qui ne pouvait que plaire à nos entreprises qui se trouvaient en concurrence avec des entreprises italiennes. Au fil des années  la capacité exportatrice de l’Italie s’est trouvée si fortement entravée que la lire a dû quitter le SME en 1993. Elle a alors rapidement perdu près de la moitié de sa valeur  éliminant en quelques mois les excès de poids accumulés pendant les dix années précédentes. De tels mouvements de yo-yo échappent à nos moyens de contrôle; ils sont dramatiques pour nos entreprises exportatrices. Si  demain - ou peut-être après-demain -  de telles situations ne survenaient plus grâce aux progrès de la stabilité monétaire en Europe  c’est l’économie suisse tout entière  comme lieu de production  qui en profiterait. Le second effet de long terme que l’on peut attendre de l’unification monétaire - et c’est peut-être un paradoxe aux yeux de certains d’entre vous -  c’est une intégration accélérée de l’économie suisse dans l’économie d’Europe continentale. Déjà aujourd’hui  la conjoncture de notre pays dépend étroitement de ce qui se passe chez nos voisins. Depuis le début des années nonante  tous nos retournements de cycle conjoncturel ont coïncidé avec ceux que l’on observait en France et en Allemagne. Aujourd’hui  notre atmosphère conjoncturelle est semblable à celle de nos voisins. Si  à l’avenir  les pulsions de l’activité économique en Europe devenaient beaucoup plus uniformes  je ne doute pas que notre rythme de production serait encore plus dépendant de ce qui se passe sur le continent. Lorsque le grand marché gagnera en homogénéité  la Suisse aura de plus en plus un profil européen. Il en résultera une synchronisation croissante des décisions de politique économique  des mouvements des taux d’intérêt et de la conjoncture. Dans le domaine monétaire  les décisions de la future Banque centrale européenne seront de première importance pour la Banque nationale suisse. Mais  au-delà de la conjoncture  si l’euro se révèle être une monnaie forte  comme les Européens le souhaitent  deux phénomènes  essentiels pour nous  se manifesteront sur les marchés financiers. D’une part  nous assisterons à une diminution des incertitudes  donc à une baisse du niveau des taux d’intérêt sur l’euro; d’autre part  dès l’instant où les marchés réaliseront que les éléments sous-jacents à l’euro et au franc sont fort semblables  ils considéreront notre monnaie comme une monnaie parente de la monnaie unique: nos taux d’intérêt pourraient ainsi être progressivement attirés par ceux de l’euro. Je ne serais donc pas surpris si  tendanciellement  nous observions ces prochaines années un rapprochement graduel des taux d’intérêt suisses et européens. Comme indiqué tout à l’heure  je ne pense pas que l’ajustement s’opérera de notre côté seulement  car une fois terminée la phase d’introduction de l’euro  les conditions de financement devraient se détendre en France comme en Allemagne. Si cette évolution intervient  c’est-à-dire si les marchés considèrent le franc et l’euro comme des monnaies de qualité semblable  l’écart entre taux suisses et européens diminuera et une intégration à terme du franc dans la zone euro ne devrait pas poser de problèmes. Je vous rappelle ici que l’objectif à long terme du Conseil fédéral est une intégration de la Suisse dans l’édifice européen en construction. 3.3. Les incertitudes Mais bien entendu  les évolutions que je vous ai décrites présupposent que l’euro BIS Review 57/1997 - 7 - devienne une monnaie stable. Certains en doutent et craignent que la monnaie unique ne soit pas le digne successeur du mark allemand. On ne peut écarter totalement cette hypothèse car l’intégration monétaire est une opération délicate. Toutefois  je reste confiant car les Européens ont reconnu ces dernières années l’importance de la stabilité des prix; ils ont aussi vu qu’une monnaie saine permet d’abaisser durablement le coût du capital  d’allouer efficacement les ressources productives et de stimuler la croissance. J’ai donc le sentiment que le SEBC veillera avec grand soin à remplir le mandat qui lui est assigné par ses statuts. Pour nous  Suisses  les incertitudes portent moins sur la qualité future de l’euro que sur les conditions de son introduction. A cet égard  cette année et l’année prochaine jouent un rôle crucial. Au-delà de 1999  le SEBC sera jugé par sa politique et il aura les moyens de maîtriser la situation. Jusque-là  les choses seront plus délicates car les marchés vont essayer  à l’aide d’informations fragmentaires et de suppositions  de mesurer la qualité de la future monnaie européenne. Une grande volatilité peut être crainte  volatilité dommageable pour notre économie. Je reste toutefois confiant. Ma confiance n’est pas du “wishful thinking”  mais repose sur des faits objectifs: En premier lieu  je crois qu’il n’est pas dans l’intérêt des Européens de procéder à l’intégration monétaire dans le désordre. Certains pays - et je pense ici à l’Allemagne - verraient certainement d’un mauvais oeil que l’introduction de l’euro entraîne une dégradation marquée de leur stabilité monétaire. Il me paraît évident que la Bundesbank prendrait des contre-mesures si une spéculation contre le mark devait se déclencher. Les Allemands sont intéressés à un euro fort. En deuxième lieu  les Européens ont tout fait jusqu’ici pour convaincre les marchés que l’intégration monétaire sera ordonnée. Les critères de convergence et le pacte de stabilité sont autant de signaux indiquant que seuls des pays financièrement sains pourront accéder à la monnaie unique. Je crois qu’il se tiendront à cette ligne de conduite jusqu’à la décision finale. En troisième lieu  en dépit des évolutions récentes  c’est le dollar - non le franc suisse - qui absorbe les incertitudes de la construction européenne. La monnaie américaine est vue par les placeurs comme la principale alternative  non notre monnaie qui  elle  se trouvera toujours dans le sillage des monnaies européennes. Quoi qu’il en soit  des risques de perturbations existent. En cas d’agitation des marchés  nous ne serions pas sans moyens pour nous défendre. Notre principale arme est la politique monétaire qui peut tenir compte des turbulences extérieures. Un assouplissement de notre politique en cas d’appréciation du franc est possible - nous venons de le démontrer il y a un peu plus d’une semaine. En cette matière  il convient toutefois de rester réaliste: la Banque nationale n’a pas les moyens de mettre la Suisse totalement à l’abri de perturbations extérieures. Comme je vous l’indiquais tout à l’heure  l’économie suisse a souvent souffert des chocs monétaires provenant de l’étranger; la politique monétaire ne peut - au mieux - qu’en atténuer les effets négatifs. Nous nous efforcerons de lutter contre les mouvements irréalistes du franc. Faudrait-il  dans ces conditions  souhaiter purement et simplement un accrochage du franc à l’euro? Par une opération de ce type  pourrait-on éliminer les risques d’un envol du franc sur les marchés? Malheureusement  il n’existe pas de solution miracle. Tant que la Suisse ne sera pas membre des Institutions européennes  il ne sera pas possible de convaincre les marchés que le franc est lié irrémédiablement à l’euro. Si nous définissions unilatéralement une BIS Review 57/1997 - 8 - parité du franc par rapport à l’euro  les marchés la testeraient. Nous attiserions plus que nous calmerions les mouvements de fonds spéculatifs. L’arrimage unilatéral du franc à la monnaie européenne ne tiendrait donc pas longtemps. 4. Conclusions Les travaux préparatoires à l’Union monétaire vont donc bon train. Au cours des prochains mois  un certain nombre de détails techniques seront encore éclaircis  c’est au printemps prochain que sera connue la liste des pays prêts à la fusion monétaire. Nous n’en serons pas. Mais nous n’en ressentirons pas moins les conséquences. J’utilise ici le terme “nous” afin de couvrir tous les acteurs de la vie économique car le changement du paysage monétaire européen sera si profond que chacun d’entre nous sera affecté  directement ou indirectement. Ce sont bien entendu ceux qui sont au front du commerce extérieur - de biens ou de services - qui verront l’environnement changer le plus rapidement. Le poids de l’euro se fera sentir; le marché européen - considéré comme international par le passé - deviendra un grand marché intérieur avec sa dimension  bien sûr  mais aussi avec ses tendances protectionnistes et dominatrices. Pour la Banque nationale également  l’euro ouvre un nouveau chapitre des relations monétaires en Europe. Nous avons confiance que le processus d’intégration se déroulera sans déclencher des vagues sur le marché des changes. Nous espérons aussi que s’installeront en Europe des conditions de stabilité qui permettront aux trajectoires du franc suisse et de l’euro de se rejoindre un jour. BIS Review 57/1997

There is a good deal of discussion these days about Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in Europe -- about the benefits and difficulties of organizing such a union. However  today I would like to examine a somewhat different issue  one that is at the other end of the spectrum; namely  How is the international system of flexible exchange rates working these days? This is not to denigrate or deny the importance of the challenges surrounding the EMU initiative  nor its relevance for those who will be directly or indirectly affected by its debut. But while many European countries have operated under a fixed exchange rate regime during the post-Bretton Woods period  most other industrial economies have chosen to operate under a flexible currency arrangement. The three major currencies  those of the United States  Japan  and Germany  float against one another. So I thought what I might do this morning is focus on flexible exchange rates and discuss  in particular  how they have performed over the past few years. The main message I would like to convey to you is that  when all is said anddone  the flexible exchange rate system has not done badly over the past 25 years. And in the last three or four years  it has done rather well in an environment characterized by low inflation and improved fiscal performance across the major industrial countries. Exchange rates have  for the most part  moved in the “right direction.” And short-run exchange rate volatility has diminished  notwithstanding some evident cyclical swings of the U.S. dollar. The initial reason for adopting floating exchange rates was more a matter of Why are the major currencies floating? circumstance than a considered choice. The Bretton Woods system  which was established shortly after the Second World War  collapsed in the early 1970s  forcing most industrial countries onto a flexible exchange rate regime as an “interim measure.” Attempts to rescue the Bretton Woods system in the summer of 1971 and the fall of 1973 proved unsuccessful. The reputed reasons for the collapse of the system were the inflationary macropolicies pursued by the United States during the late 1960s and early 1970s and the unwillingness of other countries either to inflate their economies to the same extent or to allow the U.S. dollar to devalue. But the true reasons for its demise were more deep-seated. This system  which had been viable  although prone to periodic crises  throughout the 1950s and 1960s  was clearly unable to cope in a world of liberalized trade and international capital The main problem was that the imbalances that the system was supposed to address  through discrete changes in the parity value of the affected currencies vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar and gold  proved to be much larger and more intractable than the architects of the system had ever envisaged. Moreover  countries were reluctant to adjust their currencies  even when the problems were shown to be fundamental. Thus  authorities would often subvert domestic economic objectives  such as price stability  economic growth and full employment  in order to protect outdated parities. As a result  the system was in disequilibrium more often than not. And its adjustable nature did not prove flexible enough to help countries deal with the shocks that regularly hit the international financial system. BIS Review 57/1997 - 2 - While the adoption of floating exchange rates may have been more a matter of necessity than choice  floating rates did promise greater independence in the conduct of monetary policy and better insulation from external shocks. Advocates of a floating regime  partly influenced by Canada’s favourable experience with such a system in the 1950s  suggested that exchange rates would automatically adjust to correct external imbalances in an orderly and continuous manner. And this would give domestic policymakers greater freedom than under the pegged rate system as well as obviate the need for official intervention and large international reserves. Experience with the floating rate system Needless to say  experience under the floating rate system has not been problem-free. Events did not unfold quite as its proponents had suggested  and the past 25 years have been characterized by volatile short-term movements and sizable long-term swings in most of the major currencies. The magnitude of these currency movements and our evident inability to explain them in a comprehensive  precise manner  led many observers to presume that such movements were driven by market speculation and that they were largely disconnected from economic fundamentals. There is no simple way to resolve this issue. Nonetheless  it is possible to identify some of the forces that have influenced exchange rates through this period  either by shaping their broad movements or  at times  by contributing to uncertainty and hence to excessive volatility in these rates. I would stress  in particular  the uncertainty over the future course of monetary and fiscal policies  which made it difficult for financial markets to cope with the macroeconomic pressures of the day. What forces am I talking about? In the 1970s  we had the two oil shocks  one at the beginning and one at the end of the decade. These may have been precipitated by political developments in the Middle East  but the initial shock was encouraged by the pursuit  among the major industrial countries  of higher output and employment through monetary ease and a willingness to tolerate increased inflation. Subsequently  the monetary accommodation of the price effects caused by the oil shocks added to the turbulent environment that followed. The 1970s and early 1980s turned out to be a period of high and variable inflation in many countries. High inflation  balance-of-payments difficulties arising from the oil shocks  and the large fiscal transfers necessary to support economic activity in energy-dependent countries  were the catalyst for much of what followed in the 1980s. Excessive government spending and rising public indebtedness were coupled with tighter monetary policy  as authorities struggled to maintain social services  restore full employment  and dampen the inflationary pressures that had been allowed to grow in the 1970s. The effects of this uncomfortable policy mix hit the major industrial countries with varying severity and triggered a debt crisis in the developing world. Success on the inflation front was mixed  adding to the strains that the exchange rate system was expected to cope with. While the problems in the industrial countries were generally less severe than those in the developing world  they nevertheless caused serious dislocations. Because of differences in the mix of fiscal and monetary policies in the United States compared with Germany and Japan  the U.S. dollar appreciated sharply against the deutschemark and the yen through the first part of the 1980s. In turn  these developments led to an accumulation of very BIS Review 57/1997 - 3 - large current account imbalances among these three major countries. In these circumstances  the flexible exchange rate system did not perform as well as it might have. But it is not obvious that any other alternative would have been practicable  and I doubt very much that a fixed exchange rate system for the U.S. dollar  the mark  and the yen could have survived these strains. The three major currencies were not the only ones subjected to tensions. Uncertainty about whether and how fiscal imbalances might be corrected  and considerable cross-country differences in actual and expected inflation contributed to major exchange rate pressures among other currencies in the 1980s and early 1990s. By 1992-93  these pressures had reached the breaking point in continental Europe and the United Kingdom  putting extreme stress on the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). As well as causing the United Kingdom and Italy to leave the arrangement  the situation necessitated a widening of the ERM intervention bands. What is the current situation? Although it is still early days  conditions in exchange and asset markets have improved considerably since 1993. Short-term exchange rate volatility  and even the trend movements in bilateral rates  while still significant  are much smaller than those of the previous two decades. I believe that this improved perfomance has a lot to do with the convergence we have seen in recent years towards low and stable rates of inflation among the major industrial countries. But progress on the fiscal front has also been essential  helping to reduce risk premiums and stabilize expectations  both with regard to the long-run viability of the fiscal track in many countries and the prospects for continued low inflation. Thus  I would argue that consistently low inflation and improved fiscal positions have brought about more stable  “better behaved” exchange rates  just as theory would have predicted. This is not to say that exchange rates have remained absolutely stable over the past four years. They have not. But movements have been more orderly  unlike those of the earlier periods  and most of the observed trends can be explained by the different cyclical positions of countries  the different monetary and fiscal responses  and by changes in world commodity prices. Exchange rate movements have  at times  appeared to contribute to trade imbalances or exacerbate existing ones. But this should not be interpreted as evidence that markets are pushing rates in the wrong direction. Indeed  imbalances often reflect the fact that economies are at different points of the business cycle. For example  Japan has  until very recently  seen the value of its currency decline  on balance  against the U.S. dollar  even though the country is running a large and growing trade surplus. It is obvious that much of the recent movement in the U.S. dollar/yen exchange rate has been driven by the different cyclical positions of the two countries. Thus  the relatively low yen has been helping to rejuvenate demand in Japan. Meanwhile  a strong U.S. dollar has been helping the United States to counter inflationary pressures that would otherwise require stronger doses of interest-rate medicine. Of course  it is possible for exchange rates to overreact  even in the benign environment I described a moment ago. But the chances of a serious misalignment are much lower when markets are operating in a climate of greater predictability  provided by a monetary policy grounded in domestic price stability. When exchange rates are not anchored by a credible BIS Review 57/1997 - 4 - commitment to price stability  it is difficult  if not impossible  for markets to perform the tasks that are expected of them. The operation of the flexible exchange rate system in Canada As you know  Canada has been one of the strongest proponents of a flexible exchange rate system. We were the only major industrial country to operate under such a system in the 1950s and early 1960s  and we were the first major country to adopt it again in the 1970s. As a medium-sized open economy that relies on exports of primary commodities more than our principal trading partners  we are vulnerable to external shocks and appreciate the ”shock absorber” effect provided by a flexible exchange rate. Let me tell you briefly how the Canadian economy has performed under the flexible exchange rate system and describe the main forces that have been acting on our exchange rate. The most significant trend movement occurred over the 1976 to 1986 period  when the Canadian dollar experienced a large depreciation vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar  falling from roughly parity to a low of 69 cents (U.S.) in February 1986. During this time  annual inflation rates in Canada exceeded those in the United States by about one per cent  on average. While on a yearly basis this may not sound like much  cumulatively the differential was rather significant and can explain most of the trend depreciation in the Canada-U.S. exchange rate over this period. As for the cyclical swings that accompanied the trend depreciation of the Canadian dollar  they reflected a number of factors. Among these  the most significant has been the variability in the world prices of primary commodities  which remain an important component of our exports. But the most worrisome factor during the 1980s and 1990s was the growth of the fiscal deficit and the destabilizing effect that this had on financial markets  including the foreign exchange market. Rising public debts and deficits contributed importantly to the risk premiums in interest rates on Canadian dollar assets and were the catalyst  if not the cause  of unsettling episodes in 1986  1992  and 1994. Fiscal policy concerns  at times coupled with political uncertainty  proved to be a volatile mix and led to serious financial market turbulence and speculative pressures  complicating the task of monetary policy. Fortunately  the situation has recently improved considerably. Inflation in Canada is stable  at its lowest level in decades. And it has been somewhat below that in the United States since 1992. This implies a potential appreciation of the Canadian dollar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar over time  if the inflation differential persists. But other factors also tend to favour a stronger Canadian dollar. First  deficit reduction by Canadian governments has eased the uncertainty that had pervaded financial markets  thereby shrinking risk premiums in interest rates and reversing the currency weakness caused earlier by these premiums. Second  Canadian industries are in a stronger competitive position than they have been for years  and this has contributed to a sharp reduction of the persistent deficit in the current account of our international balance of payments. Third  primary commodity prices are firm and likely to move higher with the pickup in global economic activity. In light of all this  it is not surprising that several analysts  as well as the Bank of Canada  expect a stronger Canadian dollar in the future and think that the currency is currently undervalued relative to its longer-term fundamentals. BIS Review 57/1997 - 5 - Why  then  has the Canadian dollar not been stronger? The explanation lies mainly in the different cyclical positions of the Canadian and U.S. economies. The more accommodative monetary conditions pursued in Canada during the past two years have been consistent with the needs of an economy characterized by considerable excess capacity and an inflation rate that has tended to be in the lower half of the current 1 to 3 per cent target range. Thus  lower interest rates and a relatively low Canadian dollar have been temporarily appropriate for economic reasons. While no central bank ever wishes to have a weak currency  since late 1995  the Bank of Canada has encouraged easier monetary conditions -- conditions that  at times  have taken the form of lower interest rates and a somewhat softer dollar. Put another way  the Bank did not purposely push the dollar lower  but simply aimed for the path of monetary conditions that seemed appropriate given sluggish domestic economic conditions. The particular mix of interest rate and exchange rate adjustments necessary to achieve the desired path of monetary conditions is not under the direct control of the Bank of Canada. It is essentially determined by the markets. However  the Canadian economy has been gathering momentum lately  and prospects are good for continued robust expansion through 1997 and into 1998  in response to the substantial past monetary easing. With the margin of excess capacity in the economy still fairly wide  there is ample room for strong growth in coming quarters without a resurgence of inflation. However  as the slack is absorbed  the Bank will need to pursue less stimulative monetary conditions  consistent with a durable  low-inflation economic expansion. In other words  for cyclical as well as for more fundamental reasons  the prospects are good for a stronger Canadian currency. In summary  I would say that the exchange market for the Canadian dollar has worked rather well in recent years  interpreting and responding to both the fundamental trends in our economy and the cyclical differences between Canada and the United States. I believe that fiscal discipline and a credible commitment to low inflation are key ingredients of that good performance. BIS Review 57/1997

Checklist for Risk Management (Revised Edition) The English version of the Checklist published in the May 1997 issue of the Bank of Japan Quarterly Bulletin includes specific sample questions in addition to check points that were provisionally published in the November 1996 issue. The original Checklist written in Japanese has precedence over this English version. I. Objectives The Bank Supervision Department of the Bank of Japan initially compiled the Checklist for Risk Management (hereafter referred to as the former Checklist) in December 1987 to assist examiners in assessing the adequacy of risk management at individual banks during on- site examinations. The former Checklist was distributed to financial institutions under the Bank’s supervision as a reference for checking and strengthening their risk management systems. Amid the progress in financial liberalization and innovation that has taken place during the past several years  financial institutions have expanded the scope of their business activities  and this has enabled them to pursue higher returns by taking on risks freely while giving consideration to market rules. At the same time  this has led to a better understanding by financial institutions of the importance of maintaining the balance between risk and return by adequately assessing and controlling risk exposure. As a result  financial institutions are taking the initiative in strengthening and upgrading their risk management systems in order to secure financial safety and soundness. With these changes in the environment surrounding financial institutions  the Bank of Japan has recognized the increased importance of adequately assessing any future threats to the safety and soundness of financial institutions. This implies nothing more than further strengthening and promotion of the same kind of examination focused on risk management as the Bank Supervision Department has comprehensively revised the former Checklist (hereafter referred to as the new Checklist). the past. With this aim  in Like its predecessor  the new Checklist has been distributed to all banks subject to the Bank of Japan’s supervision  as it is intended to assist banks in reviewing and strengthening their risk management systems based on the principle of self-responsibility  while serving as a guideline for bank examiners. As this revised document includes some points that will be equally useful to those financial institutions not subject to the Bank’s supervision (such as some shinkin banks  credit cooperatives  agricultural cooperatives  and labor credit associations) and business enterprises  the new Checklist is presented in the Quarterly Bulletin. II. Major Features The most prominent feature of the new Checklist is the change in categorization. In view of the transformation of risk management emphasis from heightening recognition of risks in the former Checklist to the recent actual control of risks  the overall structure of the Checklist has been altered from the eight categories by type of risk in the former Checklist (credit risk  interest rate risk  foreign exchange risk  liquidity risk  operations risk  electronic data processing [EDP] risk  systemic risk  and management risk) to four categories by type of operation (management and internal controls  lending operations  market operations and asset and liability management [ALM]  and business operations and EDP). BIS Review 60/1997 - 2 - The Checklist has also been revised to reflect the important points in risk management acquired during the Bank’s past on-site examinations  while giving due consideration to the various reports and guidelines of international organizations and foreign financial authorities  and to trading practices in Japan. Concretely  the section on management and internal controls emphasizes basic management policy and strategy concerning risk management  while including items regarding legal compliance and countermeasures against disasters. This section is given the highest priority in the new Checklist. Second  against the background of the increase in nonperforming assets accompanying the bursting of the “bubble” economy  the section on lending operations has been strengthened to reflect points important in the evaluation of creditworthiness and avoidance of credit concentration. At the same time  this section promotes comprehensive management of domestic  overseas  on-balance-sheet  and off-balance-sheet transactions  and includes general remarks foreseeing the introduction of a loan grading and review system  further contributing to the continued enhancement of risk management as a whole. Third  the section on market operations and ALM has been expanded in content  as this section is the most strongly influenced by the progress in financial liberalization and innovation  namely  the rapid growth in derivatives transactions and the greater impact of ALM skills on profit/loss of financial institutions. This section incorporates numerous concepts from the Checklist for Risk Management on Derivatives Transactions  which was compiled and issued in April 1995  and reflects new risk management techniques and lessons learned from some of the recent financial incidents. Fourth  with the development of EDP at financial institutions  more weight has been put on EDP in the section on business operations and EDP. Furthermore  to reinforce the importance of the accuracy of individual offices’ work  this section has given as comprehensive a treatment as possible to such issues as new types of transactions accompanying progress in information technology (i.e.  fund transactions using customers’ computer terminals).

McDonough  before the 39th International Congress of the Association Cambiste International  The Financial Markets Association in Toronto on 30/5/97.,Mr. McDonough examines recent developments and trends in the foreign exchange markets Remarks by the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  Mr. William J. McDonough  before the 39th International Congress of the Association Cambiste International  The Financial Markets Association in Toronto on 30/5/97. I am delighted to be invited to address the 39th International Congress of the Association Cambiste Internationale (ACI) -- The Financial Markets Association. I must confess to a certain affinity for the foreign exchange community  stemming  no doubt  from my commercial banking experience and my time overseeing the foreign exchange desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I’ve long believed that  more so than in most other sectors of the finance industry  there is a real community among those engaged in foreign exchange -- a community that relies on close personal ties and contacts. It is this spirit of community that makes events such as these ACI meetings today and tomorrow so enjoyable and important  giving us the opportunity to renew old friendships and build new relationships that will enable us to do our respective jobs that much better. In my remarks to you this morning  I would like to highlight some recent developments in the foreign exchange market and share with you my view  as a central banker  of what has been driving some of the trends we’ve been observing. We heard a lot of talk in the foreign exchange markets in 1996 about the “end of volatility.” As the market performance of the last few weeks has demonstrated  such commentary was a bit exaggerated. However  even with the spike in volatility we’ve seen in recent weeks  there is no question that we have witnessed a remarkable period of relative stability in foreign exchange rates over the past six quarters or so. What accounts for this relative stability in the foreign exchange markets since late 1995? Economic fundamentals are certainly one factor -- we have had a period of relative price stability in the major world economies  and a general absence of severe market shocks. However  I would argue that what we’ve been observing is also  in part  a by-product of continuously greater transparency that has characterized the foreign exchange market over the past several years. Moreover  I am convinced that the increased transparency in the foreign exchange markets is beneficial: for the foreign exchange community  for financial markets in general  and for the global economy as a whole. Before explaining what I mean by greater transparency and why I believe it is so beneficial  I would like to take a quick look at the record itself. Is the talk about declining volatility reflected in hard evidence? Yes  it largely is. Thirty-day dollar-mark and dollar-yen historical volatility remained below 10 percent throughout most of 1996 and the first quarter of 1997  and  even with the price action we saw in May  the spike in thirty-day historical volatility we’ve observed is not particularly dramatic when compared with similar periods in past years. Similarly  implied volatility on dollar-mark and dollar-yen options traded to near record lows in 1996. But  as this month has shown  volatility has not been eliminated. There also have been a number of days in the past year and a half with considerable volatility in the foreign exchange market. And  I have no doubt that we’ll have many more of these days -- at times  for example  when markets rapidly adjust to new information or when periods of poor liquidityresult in exaggerated price swings. What is clear is that this is a market that is constantly evolving. None of us can say with any certainty whether we’re observing the beginning of a trend or an anomalous period BIS Review 60/1997 - 2 - that will ultimately be viewed as a brief lull in volatility. However  I don’t think many of you would disagree with me when I say that the foreign exchange market over the past six quarters or so has changed significantly from that in 1994 and 1992. For those of you who  like me  were involved in this business in the 1970s and 1980s following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system  the contrast is very dramatic. Given these realities  we must ask ourselves what has changed to alter the way foreign exchange rates fluctuate in the global marketplace? It is obvious that this is not a case of declining volume. The foreign exchange survey most recently published by the Bank for International Settlements in 1996 shows that daily volume in foreign exchange grew by almost 50 percent between 1992 and 1995  and we have no reason to think that anything has changed since then to alter this trend. What has changed  however  is the new  higher level of transparency that has been introduced in recent years into the foreign exchange market. When I speak of transparency  I am actually referring to a combination of several factors. Broadly speaking  I define transparency in this market as the degree to which its participants have equal and simultaneous access to the inputs necessary to price assets and their associated risk accurately. By reducing guesswork and uncertainty  transparency helps to smooth price adjustments and eliminate some of the shocks that can result when market participants discover they have “priced in” assumptions that are inaccurate. In my view  the current move toward greater market transparency is reflected in four broad categories: policy  information  pricing  and risk management. The increased transparency of central bank policy -- which is a product of deliberate steps taken by policymakers -- is an important aspect of the move toward more transparent overall market conditions that we’ve been observing. Over the past several years  central banks in a number of countries  most notably in Canada  New Zealand  Australia  and the United Kingdom  have become increasingly convinced of the value of making a public commitment to an articulated and transparent policy standard  usually price stability. By setting clear policy objectives  the makers of monetary policy can eliminate much of the guesswork that central bank watchers must engage in to figure out what the central bank will do next. In so doing  they can help anchor inflation expectations over the long term  and thereby foster economic growth by ensuring a stable price environment. Many central banks are also increasingly coming to realize that much of the secrecy and cautious signaling that once characterized monetary policy decisions is  to some extent  counterproductive. In recent years  a number of central banks have taken measures to further open up their policy processes to the public. For example  prior to February 1994  changes in monetary policy in the United States were signaled to the market through open market operations. Since that time  the Federal Reserve has publicly announced changes in policy  typically following each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee  or FOMC. Some policymakers had been concerned that this shift in procedure for communicating policy decisions might create additional market volatility. In fact  a recent study by some of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found just the opposite -- that announcing policy changes has not led to increased volatility in the federal funds rate. By making information on monetary policy decisions available quickly and broadly  we at the Federal Reserve have helped level the playing field and  I believe  contributed to smoothing the process by which new information on FOMC policy is incorporated more quickly and efficiently in asset prices. BIS Review 60/1997 - 3 - Other central banks have similarly increased transparency in their monetary policy processes. One example is the Bank of England’s move to publish the minutes of the monthly policy meetings between the Chancellor and the Bank of England Governor  a practice that is to continue under the new monetary policy council. The Bank of Canada  too  has taken steps to increase the level of transparency in its markets. It now publishes a semiannual monetary policy report and sets an explicit level for its bank rate. National governments also have contributed to greater transparency in monetary policy by increasingly recognizing the value of endowing their central banks with greater independence. Moves of this sort have occurred in several Western European countries and many emerging market economies  especially in Latin America  over the past several years. A second area where recent developments have resulted in improved transparency in the foreign exchange market is information technology. Easy and inexpensive access to a vast array of information has changed the way financial markets absorb new data. Most of us in this room sit in offices or trading rooms with keyboard access to data  analysis  and news that once took huge resources to manage. And  neither bankers nor traders have a monopoly on this capacity -- corporate treasurers and institutional investors can pull up most of the same screens we can. At one time  a presence in a local market and access to early newspapers could provide a trading advantage for a large market maker. Today  news from that market is available electronically worldwide with almost no lag. Information is cheaper and easier to come by than ever before. The result? A global market that reacts quickly and efficiently to new data  and participants who have more time to analyze information because they need to spend less time gathering it. One consequence of this improved transparency in information technology is that information gets reflected in asset prices more quickly and more smoothly than ever before. A closely related development that has also contributed to increased transparency in the foreign exchange market has been the rapid evolution of the price discovery process in the past several years. Electronic brokerage and electronic interbank dealing systems have evolved that have smoothed the dissemination of current pricing and improved market liquidity. Whereas truly competitive pricing was once the province of only the largest market makers  smaller interbank dealers -- and even some foreign exchange end-users -- now also have access to narrow bid-ask spreads. The result so far has been a deeper market and  again  a more level playing field for all market participants  with pricing no longer dominated by a few large players. The final area in which recent innovations have improved market transparency is risk management. While we are far from being able to rest on our laurels  there is no denying the fact that financial institutions  their customers  and their investors have become more sophisticated over the past several years at evaluating  monitoring  and controlling market risk. If market participants better understand the risk of the positions they put on their books  they are more able to react effectively and efficiently when their assumptions are challenged or unwound. Although it is crucial that rapid innovations in trading and risk management practices continue  most of the institutions represented here have already made important progress along these lines in recent years. What needs to be stressed  however  is that it is not enough for a firm to develop - for internal purposes alone -- sophisticated new techniques to assess  price  and manage increasingly refined components of financial risk. If financial markets are to function most efficiently  shareholders  creditors  and counterparties of these firms also must be able to BIS Review 60/1997 - 4 - assess the risks when they make their evaluations. In order for them to do this  meaningful information about risks and risk management performance must be available. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been actively involved in encouraging an evolution of disclosure practices that will improve the functioning of financial markets. As you may know  Peter Fisher  an executive vice president of the New York Fed  chaired a working group of the Euro-Currency Standing Committee of the G-10 central banks  which published a discussion paper on “Public Disclosure of Market and Credit Risks by Financial Intermediaries” in September 1994. This so-called Fisher report described how trading and financial risk management practices had developed far beyond the public disclosure of financial information  creating a gap between the precision with which a firm’s management could assess and adjust the firm’s own risk exposures and the information available to outsiders to help them assess the riskiness of that firm’s activities. Recognizing that such an asymmetry of available information could cause the misallocation of capital among firms and amplify market disturbances  the Fisher report recommended that all financial intermediaries -- regulated and unregulated -- move in the direction of publicly disclosing periodic quantitative information. The information requested would provide estimates relied upon by the firm’s management of: the market risks in the relevant portfolio or portfolios  as well as the firm’s actual performance in managing the market risks in these portfolios; and the counterparty credit risks arising from the firm’s trading and risk management activities. By and large  these proposed measures for reporting risk have been adopted voluntarily by many major banking institutions around the world  with many others moving in that direction. As such  they have contributed importantly to improved transparency in financial markets. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has also been deeply involved in efforts to reduce foreign exchange settlement risk -- efforts that should further serve to improve market efficiency and overall financial stability. In October 1994  the New York Fed-sponsored Foreign Exchange Committee issued a major report on “Reducing Foreign Exchange Settlement Risk.” The Bank has also been working actively in this area with other central banks through the G-10 central bank Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems  or CPSS  which I have had the pleasure to chair in recent years. Building upon the work of the New York Foreign Exchange Committee  the CPSS published a document in March of last year  often referred to as the Allsopp report  that contains a comprehensive strategy outlining how the public and private sectors can work together to reduce foreign exchange settlement risk. The strategy was endorsed by the G-10 central bank governors and calls for specific action on the part of individual banks and industry groups. A survey conducted by the CPSS last autumn indicates that individual banks are answering the G-10 governors’ call for action. Many banks have made a good start in improving their ability to measure  manage  control  and net their bilateral settlement exposures  and they plan to push these efforts even further over the next year. While this is a very encouraging beginning  we can’t ignore the fact that more work must be done by individual banks. With this in mind  the CPSS will continue to closely monitor progress over the next year for any signs of slippage. BIS Review 60/1997 - 5 - The search by individual banks for efficient ways to reduce their foreign exchange settlement risk has brought about important progress at the industry-group level as well. The Allsopp report noted the efforts of FXNET  S.W.I.F.T  ECHO  Multinet  and the Group of 20 banks to offer various types of risk-reducing services  and these ongoing efforts are very encouraging. Some banks are also exploring the elimination of settlement risk altogether by shifting the market to trades that simply settle the gain or loss associated with exchange rate movements -- called “contracts for difference” -- instead of requiring delivery of the underlying currencies. We are well aware that many market participants are currently debating what constitutes the most efficient multi-currency netting and settlement services. While there will be potential winners and losers  I believe that the market as a whole should ultimately benefit from this rigorous competition. At the same time  settlement risk reduction should not be used to justify the concentration of market power. The G-10 central bank governors have long been on record in favor of fair and open access to services that permit participation by a broad range of institutions  consistent with the prudent management of risk. Such access was formally adopted as a requirement for multilateral netting systems  and I am convinced that the G-10 central banks would apply a similar standard when evaluating the start-up of any major multi-currency settlement service. In sum  the evolution toward more transparent foreign exchange markets that we’ve observed in the past several years is largely a product of both technological progress in the private sector and conscious policy decisions in the public sector. None of the policy decisions  I should stress  were taken with any explicit or implicit intention of reducing market volatility. On the contrary  the policy community has viewed moves toward increased transparency as desirable ends in and of themselves for a number of reasons. For one  transparency promotes a more level playing field for all market participants. In other words  transparent markets tend not to be dominated by just a few players. Rather  they are open to new entrants  large and small. In such markets  no one group of institutions or type of institution can develop a monopoly on information or competitive pricing. As in most industries  competition in the area of financial services spurs innovation  better service for customers  and a more efficient allocation of resources. Second  transparency in these markets also promotes investment. If money and investment fund managers or corporate CFOs can better understand the risks entailed in various investment alternatives  they are more likely to make the investment decisions best suited to their needs. The result  again  is a more efficient allocation of global capital than would otherwise be possible. To the extent  therefore  that reduced volatility in the foreign exchange market stems from improved transparency  I would view this result as a beneficial by-product -- one that also contributes to the ultimate goal of economic and monetary policy: namely  sustained growth and a stable price environment. The move toward increased transparency in global markets and the accompanying relative decline in foreign exchange market volatility and trading ranges that we have observed in the last year and a half have posed considerable challenges to market makers  spot traders  and brokers  on both an institutional and a personal level. There is an axiom in these markets that volatility is good for market makers. I believe that this is a short-sighted view. On the contrary  I BIS Review 60/1997 - 6 - would submit that excessive volatility not only frightens investors  but also potentially undermines growth and  in so doing  benefits none of us. As a result  I cannot help but conclude that stable -- and not volatile -- markets are in the best interests of both central banks and the financial community. Stability in foreign exchange and other financial markets  along with price stability  is vital to the promotion of sustainable economic growth and rising living standards for everyone. Reducing the diversion of resources to deal with uncertainty and volatility allows resources to be directed toward more productive uses and  in so doing  promotes long-term growth by increasing the resource base available to the economy. We have seen in high-inflation economies how the transfer of resources away from productive activities and into financial transactions geared toward dealing with inflation uncertainty can negatively affect growth. We have also seen how a proliferation of tax code dodges can decrease the available resource base. If individuals must spend more time engaging in financial maneuvers because of uncertainty  then more of the economy’s productive capacity is transferred to the activity of handling transactions. An expansion of the financial sector that stems from an increasing number of people employed to handle distortions arising from inflation and its attendant uncertainty is growth that diverts resources better employed elsewhere. By contrast  an expansion of the financial sector that stems from growth of productivity is growth that offers benefits to all. The same basic principle applies to the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange rates are fundamentally determined by market forces and should be free to fluctuate as a vital adjustment mechanism for the global economy. However  excessive volatility  like price instability  can diminish resources otherwise available for productive growth. The economy in which we live and work is a global one  and becomes more so every year. Regions and industries in need of private capital and investors requiring adequate returns benefit when money can move across national boundaries without excessive risk or hedging costs. Foreign exchange markets that are more stable and more transparent ultimately will better allow investors to allocate their capital efficiently  thereby improving global economic growth. Change is difficult in any industry and can put enormous stress on individuals. I’m not ignoring this dynamic. However  I am persuaded that  in the long run  what is good for economic growth is in the best interests of the financial community  and  in turn  benefits the individuals that make up that community. Just as U.S. industries went through enormous stress in the 1970s and 1980s in coping with a new era of expanding international trade and emerged in the 1990s as among the most competitive in the world  so too must global financial institutions adapt and find new ways to add value and share in the larger benefits that transparency and reduced volatility can bring. We central bankers can contribute to this process. While we can do little to limit market volatility directly  we can work toward more transparent markets supported by sound infrastructure  and by these means lay the groundwork for market stability. And  while we’re not in the business of determining market rates or the ranges in which rates should trade  what we are trying to do is move increasingly toward improving the transparency of our own operations as an end in and of itself. Our collective efforts  along with developments in information technology and risk management techniques  have already contributed to improved market stability. The growing  and successful  commitment of central banks to the achievement of price stability as BIS Review 60/1997 - 7 - their primary goal is another crucial and positive contribution toward market stability. Moreover  where we as central banks see gaps that develop in the global financial system  as we did in the areas of market risk and settlement risk management  we play the role of facilitator to private sector solutions. As central bankers  we tend to view our role in the global financial markets as ensuring that the necessary infrastructure is in place to promote well-functioning markets for all players. Then we step aside and let the markets take care of themselves. BIS Review 60/1997

I. Introduction I am greatly honored to have been invited today to address this distinguished audience. I would like to take this opportunity to first discuss recent monetary and economic conditions in Japan and issues regarding the financial system. I would then like to discuss the Bank of Japan’s views on financial market reform in Japan  the subject of heated discussion since Prime Minister Hashimoto proposed the “Big Bang” deregulation package for Japan on November 11  1996. The financial markets constitute the infrastructure supporting a nation’s economy  and thus their efficient and stable functioning is essential to the promotion of unhindered economic growth in the long term. Accordingly  market reform has become an urgent issue in Japan  as the financial markets seem to be losing international competitiveness. However  various arguments are being heard on the pace and the potential side effects of the reform. Bearing these arguments in mind  I wish to return to the basics of market reform and discuss why a reform is currently needed in Japan and the approach to be taken in promoting the reform. II. Recent Monetary and Economic Conditions in Japan A. The Strength of Economic Recovery I would like to start by examining the strength of the self-sustained economic recovery over the past several years. According to the Economic Planning Agency  the current economic recovery began in October 1993  and has continued for about three and a half years. The recovery  however  has not been constant  and therefore  many people may not have been able to appreciate the true strength of the recovery. In fact  the growth rate of the economy remained low at around 1 percent even after 1993  and there were concerns about the occurrence of a deflationary spiral at one time in 1995. This extremely slow pace of economic recovery was due to the fact that the Japanese economy had to overcome various structural adjustment pressures - that is  pressures to reduce the burdens created by the bursting of the economic “bubble” and pressures to adapt to a new global economic environment. Since 1996  however  the recovery in real economic activity has finally become evident. Looking at GDP growth in 1996  the contribution of fiscal expenditures  which had been large at the beginning of the year  gradually decreased. At the same time  the pace of decline in net exports (exports in excess of imports) slowed  and domestic private demand  such as business fixed investment and personal consumption  showed steady growth. Owing mostly to the increase in domestic private demand  GDP in the fourth quarter of 1996 grew by 2.9 percent over the same period of the previous year  despite the negative contribution by public works. The key to the realization of a self-sustained economic recovery is the sustainability of recovery in domestic private demand. In this respect  there have been concerns that the recovery in business fixed investment might be due in large part to the temporary increase in investment in the telecommunications industry. Equally  there have been concerns that growth in housing investment and personal consumption might have been caused mainly by the boost in demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate in fiscal 1997. BIS Review 61/1997 - 2 - These issues must be examined from various points of view when judging the economic outlook for the current fiscal year. I would  however  like to emphasize here that a virtuous circle of demand  production  and income has gradually come into operation from the latter half of 1996. During the first half of 1996  increase in demand did not bring about significant improvement in production  as the increase was offset by growth in imports and inventory adjustment. In the latter half of the year  however  the decline in external demand halted due to the depreciation of the yen  and  in addition  inventory adjustment progressed. As a result  the increase in final demand was reflected fully in production growth. In fact  the year-to-year growth rate of production improved from less than 1 percent in the first half of 1996 to 4.4 percent in the latter half of 1996  a level consistent with the growth in demand. The increase in production appears to have led to a recovery in business fixed investment and employment in the latter half of 1996  through increased corporate profits. This virtuous circle of demand  production  and income brightens the prospects for a sustained recovery in domestic private demand. The strength of recovery  however  is different in each economic sector. According to the results of the March 1997 “Tankan - Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan ” while increased corporate profits have been stimulating increases in business fixed investment  they have not to the same extent led to increased consumption through improved employment and wage conditions. In addition  while business fixed investment by large firms continues to increase  recovery in the levels of investment by smaller firms has not yet gained strength. While several factors remain uncertain  the Bank of Japan judges that the economic recovery has gradually been firming since autumn 1996  on the basis of the developments in the economic growth rate and its determining factors  and the strengthening of the virtuous circle. B. Future Economic and Price Developments  and Monetary Policy Management The Bank will pay close attention to whether the self-sustained recovery of private demand from fiscal 1996 will further strengthen  leading to a firm recovery of the economy despite the downward pressures of fiscal tightening. The developments in the financial markets indicate considerable concern on the part of market participants as to the firmness of economic recovery. Long-term interest rates continued to decline from autumn 1996 and have recently been at a historic low of 2.1 to 2.2 percent. Stock prices fell sharply at the beginning of the year with no significant improvement thereafter. The results of the March 1997 Tankan also indicated that while firms were confident about their business outlook in terms of expected sales and profits  they had little expectation of an improvement in business conditions in the second quarter. The low level of confidence in the economic outlook may be attributed to a variety of causes. The renewed concern over the nonperforming-loan problem of financial institutions and its effects on the economy may be one factor. With regard to economic developments in the short-term  however  the most significant factors are likely to be the concerns over the downward pressures of fiscal tightening. The Bank has not yet detected any clear signs of such downward pressures  and intends to continue examining the possible effects of fiscal tightening. There appear to be  however  several good reasons not to be too pessimistic. Regarding fiscal tightening  public works are not to be cut drastically in the new fiscal year  but rather  have already been reduced gradually from the latter half of 1996. Despite the decline in public works  domestic private demand has continued to expand  supported in part by the improvement in external demand. BIS Review 61/1997 - 3 - With regard to the rise in the consumption tax rate  it may have two different types of impact: (1) in the short term  the rise may induce an increase in demand ahead of its implementation and a subsequent reaction after the rate change; and (2) in the longer term  it may fundamentally affect consumer behavior. As to the short-term influence  this may have made a certain contribution to the recent improvement in economic indicators such as increased automobile sales and department store sales. From April  therefore  it is likely that there will be some reaction against the increase. From the viewpoint of achieving a self-sustained economic recovery  however  what matters is how the increase in the consumption tax rate will fundamentally change consumer behavior through a decline in the purchasing power of households. The degree of the change will depend largely on consumer confidence and wage conditions. In this respect  the recent improvement in employment and wage conditions  though modest  is encouraging. Nevertheless  a temporary slowdown in economic recovery is likely as the various effects of fiscal tightening will be seen most strongly between now and summer. The Bank  however  is also of the view that the current trend of recovery is likely to be maintained owing to the recent strengthening of the virtuous circle in the economy. In this respect  the Bank will continue to monitor closely economic developments  especially consumer behavior. Turning to recent price developments  it has become increasingly clear that prices have stopped declining since the end of 1996  following an improvement in the domestic supply and demand conditions and a rise in import prices. While the decline in crude oil prices makes it unlikely that import prices will rise further  putting additional upward pressures on domestic prices  the Bank will continue to monitor price developments closely  including the effects of the depreciation of the yen. If I should mention one point about the recent foreign exchange developments  it is that the Bank’s thinking is based on the Group of Seven agreement that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals and that excess volatility is undesirable. While refraining from commenting on specific exchange rate levels  the Bank will continue to carefully watch foreign exchange rate developments  which have recently shown rather rapid movements. Returning to the subject of prices  the raising of the consumption tax rate in April will be reflected in product prices  pushing up the price index accordingly. It would not be appropriate to formulate monetary policy against such a one-time  superficial price adjustment. The issue of concern is whether the rise in the tax rate will trigger price hikes taking advantage of the rise or will lead to inflationary expectations  which in turn might bring about price rises beyond the immediate effects of the tax rate increase. The Bank will also continue to monitor price developments carefully from this viewpoint  with particular attention given to the underlying domestic supply and demand conditions and consumer confidence. In the management of current monetary policy  the Bank of Japan will continue to monitor economic developments closely  placing emphasis on further strengthening the foundation for economic recovery. III. Issues Regarding the Financial System I would now like to move on to the issues regarding the financial system. From the end of fiscal 1996 to the beginning of fiscal 1997  a number of banks announced their intention to front-load their schedule of writing off nonperforming loans and to revise their business results for fiscal 1996 downward accordingly. On April 1  Nippon Credit Bank announced a comprehensive restructuring package  and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Hokkaido Bank announced their plan to merge in pursuit of more efficient management. These developments indicate the determination of Japanese financial institutions to adapt to the far-reaching reform of Japan’s financial system  which I will discuss later  while continuing to strive to promptly resolve their nonperforming loans. BIS Review 61/1997 - 4 - I would therefore like to discuss the implications that the decisions of Nippon Credit Bank and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank may have for Japan’s financial system as a whole and for the nonperforming-loan problem with which the system is burdened. Let me first explain the circumstances which led these banks to take such drastic actions. In recent years  significant progress has been made in the disposal of nonperforming loans by major financial institutions including city banks  long-term credit banks  and trust banks. As a result of active provisioning and write-offs  in fact  most banks already have a clear prospect of completing the disposal within a year or two. Nippon Credit Bank and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank  however  have tended to fall behind others due to the large amount of nonperforming loans they hold relative to their financial strength. Needless to say  it has been believed that both banks could dispose of the nonperforming loans over an extended period of time. However  with the financial markets about to undergo a drastic change  financial institutions that will require time to solve their nonperforming loan problem will unavoidably be placed under serious constraints as they try to survive the reform. With this in mind  domestic and overseas market participants have begun to scrutinize the financial conditions of Japanese financial institutions with increasing severity since the beginning of the year. In this context  the two banks were urged to set forth restructuring plans which are comprehensive enough to remove the sources of uncertainty in the market. Nippon Credit Bank announced a plan which includes thorough restructuring  comprehensive disposal of nonperforming loans  and reinforcement of the capital base. Private financial institutions which have direct capital or business interest in Nippon Credit Bank have been asked to participate in the capital subscription to the bank. The capital which cannot be obtained from private financial institutions will be supplemented by the New Financial Stabilization Fund through the underwriting of preferred shares. This will be carried out using the outstanding amount which has been contributed to the Fund by the Bank of Japan. In this respect  the restructuring plan of Nippon Credit Bank involves public support. We at the Bank believe that Nippon Credit Bank is by no means insolvent  and that it is fully capable of reconstructing its financial position. We have at the same time determined that the entire financial system might be adversely influenced should the implementation of the comprehensive measures to solve the financial problems of Nippon Credit Bank be delayed  and should market confidence in the bank not be maintained or restored. Based on this judgment and in light of the objective of the Fund - which is to “enhance the stability of and global confidence in our country’s financial system” - the Bank deemed it appropriate to utilize the New Financial Stabilization Fund to reinforce the capital base of Nippon Credit Bank. Meanwhile  Hokkaido Takushoku Bank announced a plan to merge with Hokkaido Bank  also based in the Hokkaido region  with a view to becoming a so-called super-regional bank with a stable customer base in the Hokkaido region and with operations in a geographically larger area in the rest of Japan. As part of the planned merger  they announced a management strategy to strengthen the financial base  improve customer services  and thus contribute to invigorating the regional economy. Although the cases of Nippon Credit Bank and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank are different  one involving public support and the other a commercial solution  the approaches taken by the two banks in coping with their problems have points in common. First  both banks are to implement far-reaching restructuring measures in terms of their operation  personnel  and branches  which are unprecedented for major Japanese banks. The plans adopted by the two banks would be comparable to the drastic restructuring measures adopted by U.S. commercial banks in the latter half of the 1980s and in the early 1990s to solve their management problems. Second  both banks plan to withdraw from overseas operations. Nippon Credit Bank subsequently announced an agreement on business collaboration with Bankers Trust of the United States. BIS Review 61/1997 - 5 - We at the Bank are strongly encouraged by these initiatives because they indicate a significant shift from the conventional strategy pursued to date by major Japanese banks  and will contribute significantly to the smooth implementation of the two banks’ restructuring packages. The common aspects of the two cases illustrate the determination of Japanese financial institutions to renovate themselves in order to adapt positively to the changing financial environment. As I shall discuss later  the Japanese financial system is undergoing a drastic change in preparation for the 21st century. These two cases reflect the fact that managements are seriously reconsidering their strategies  freeing themselves from their traditional way of thinking  through identifying areas of comparative advantage and improving customer services. The measures taken by the two banks represent significant steps toward the resolution of nonperforming loans. The disposal of nonperforming loans by Nippon Credit Bank will reach a level comparable to other major banks. In addition  Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Hokkaido Bank will be able to complete the disposal of their nonperforming loans much faster than they would have separately  for the merger will greatly enhance efficiency through such measures as reorganization and consolidation of branch network and elimination of redundant investment. The decisions of the two banks are thus expected to contribute significantly to removing uncertainties from  and ensuring domestic and international confidence in the Japanese financial system. At the same time  the Bank believes that the proposed measures are of great significance in the sense that they represent voluntary action taken by financial institutions in preparation for the fundamental reform of the Japanese financial system. IV. Financial Market Reform A. The Necessity for Market Reform I would now like to move on to the other theme of my speech  financial market reform in Japan. Specific measures of the Big Bang deregulation package for Japan are currently under deliberation in the relevant councils. I would therefore like to discuss the fundamental points of this issue  such as why a reform of the financial markets and the financial system is currently needed  and the approach to be taken in promoting the reform. Today  financial innovations are in progress around the world  and new financial instruments and transactions are being developed one after another. At the same time  however  the Japanese financial markets seem to be losing international competitiveness. This is the main reason the markets need to be reformed. Failure to heighten competitiveness would result in the hollowing out of the Japanese financial markets  eventually threatening the sound development of the Japanese economy. Since the 1980s  Japan has gradually deregulated the financial sector. Interest rates on deposits have been liberalized  and banks and securities companies have been permitted to enter into each other’s fields of business through subsidiaries. During this period  however  the Tokyo market has fallen far behind the New York and London markets in its ability to develop diverse financial instruments and services. This is partly because Japanese financial institutions had to divert much of their energy to the disposal of nonperforming loans  a burden created by the bursting of the economic “bubble.” It is also attributable to the conventional frameworks of the Japanese financial markets and the financial system  which have been left unchanged despite the rapidly changing financial environment  making it difficult to develop and introduce new financial instruments and services. Globally  the most conspicuous change in the financial markets in recent years has been the rapid progress in financial innovations  reflecting the development of computer and communications technology. New financial instruments such as derivatives and securitization have made it possible to unbundle risks - namely  credit risk  interest rate risk  and foreign exchange risk - of conventional BIS Review 61/1997 - 6 - financial instruments such as loans and bonds  and trade these risks individually or as various combinations of risks. The risks traded through the new financial instruments are no different from those originally incorporated in the conventional financial products. However  the range of services that financial institutions can provide has expanded significantly as it has become possible to trade only the risks without paying for or delivering the underlying asset. Conventional financial services  for example  focused on the flow of funds  that is  investment and financing  of firms and households. In comparison  recent financial services place greater emphasis on analyzing the overall risks of the assets and liabilities of firms to hedge those risks or to take new risks. The services can thus be elaborately tailored to the specific financial conditions of individual customers. In other words  it has become possible for firms and households to manage their portfolios efficiently and more flexibly by utilizing custom-made services based on advice from financial institutions. The words derivatives and securitization may sound irrelevant to households  but they have in fact increased opportunities for households to efficiently manage their assets and liabilities  by expanding the range of assets in which pension trusts and investment trusts can be invested indirectly through institutional investors  and by increasing the range of instruments which can be accessed directly by households. in financial Along with the progress in computer and communications technology are further promoting financial globalization. Today  firms and institutional investors around the world are not only transferring funds frequently across borders  but are also accessing financial markets worldwide on a daily basis in pursuit of the best means to control risk. In terms of technical capability at least  by utilizing computer networks  even firms that are small in scale can solicit funds directly from overseas investors and individuals can deal directly with overseas financial institutions. innovations  advances Availability of diverse financial services to meet the potential needs of firms and households provides the basis for revitalizing the financial sector as a growth industry. Countries around the world have recognized the financial sector as a high growth industry  and for this reason they have been vying with each other in the reform of their domestic financial markets. The Big Bang implemented in the United Kingdom in the mid-1980s was in fact aimed at strengthening the financial sector as the leading industry of the country’s economy by attracting back to London financial transactions that had shifted to the United States. The development and introduction of diverse financial services is becoming increasingly important in Japan as well  given the changes in the flow of capital in Japan and abroad. With the accumulation of personal assets and the need to prepare for the aging of society  there is a growing demand in the household sector for diversification of assets and risks  while the corporate sector is waiting for the emergence of venture businesses to lead growth industries and the establishment of new channels to facilitate the supply of capital to such businesses. There is concern  however  as to whether the Japanese financial markets have the capacity to create financial services and instruments which can satisfy the various needs of the corporate and household sectors. The conventional framework of the Japanese financial system has divided the industry by type of business  entrusted each type of business to specialized financial institutions  and prohibited institutions from entering into other types of business. The majority opinion is that this institutional segmentation of financial businesses was effective in supplying capital to priority industries during the postwar reconstruction period and the era of high economic growth. With the rapidly expanding scope of financial services and the diversifying needs of users  however  the appropriateness of such segmentation has come into question. It must indeed be thoroughly examined whether it is impeding the provision of efficient financial services and the introduction of new financial technology  and whether it is restricting market competition. BIS Review 61/1997 - 7 - It is also important to review the institutional frameworks of the legal  tax  and accounting systems to make them suitable for the financial services of the new era. If the institutional frameworks are not improved  even transactions between residents may shift to overseas markets due to the exercise of choice by market participants. This may be called “transactions flight” rather than “capital flight.” As the financial markets constitute the infrastructure supporting the economic activity of a country  hollowing out of the markets must be prevented. B. The Basic Approach to Market Reform As I have explained  market reform should not be conducted as a mere deregulation process. Rather  it should be promoted from the viewpoint of creating an internationally competitive market and making the market attractive to domestic and overseas participants. In doing so  it must be remembered that countries around the world are also striving to attract domestic and cross-border financial transactions to their own markets by enhancing their international competitiveness. That is to say  while the systems of various countries differ significantly  each country is reviewing its existing system on a continuous basis in pursuit of improved efficiency. Therefore  if we simply consider the present New York and London markets as our goal  we might find ourselves trailing behind those markets by the time reform in Japan is realized. In other words  it is most important to try to be one or two steps ahead of the times as we rebuild Japan’s financial markets. The frame of reference in these efforts is to fully utilize the creativity of the private sector  or in other words  to maximize the functioning of the market mechanism. In fact  the driving force for the development of the New York and London markets has been the innovative strength of the market mechanism. It is therefore important that existing regulations be reviewed and abolished as much as possible while placing stronger emphasis on market participants’ self-responsibility and on honoring market discipline. It is essential that a framework be built in which diverse financial services are made available to the public  enabling them to choose the most efficient products or products that sufficiently meet their various needs. Such a framework will not only promote greater efficiency of the entire financial system by drawing out innovative ideas through competition  but should also contribute to the stability of the financial system by putting to work the check mechanism inherent in markets. When we look back at the Japanese financial markets from this perspective  we see that every attempt to introduce a new financial product  such as commercial paper or securitized instruments  required a lengthy process before the product could actually be launched. This was because there was always heated debate about whether the new product could be construed as a negotiable security under the Securities Exchange Act of 1948  in order to determine which type of financial institution  that is  securities companies or banks  would handle the product. Another feature of the Japanese financial markets has been the restrictions or conditions imposed to limit the risk carried by securities traded on the capital market  that is  those imposed on the investment instruments of institutional investors and on the corporate issuers of negotiable securities. Examples are the restrictions on equity investment by investment trusts and pension funds and the qualification criteria for corporate bond issues  which were abolished at the end of 1995. This feature  however  seems to have constrained the basic function of the capital market which is to realize efficient transfers of business risks based on the price mechanism and has consequently restricted access to the capital market. Such features of the Japanese financial markets had the aim of protecting investors  which was realized by making specific institutions responsible for specific financial instruments  and then regulating and supervising the institutions responsible for handling the financial products. Should this remain unchanged  however  new financial instruments may not be introduced expeditiously and the functions of the capital market may not be fully utilized  further weakening the international competitiveness of the Japanese markets. In addition  if regulations continue to severely restrict the activities of the institutions offering financial products  this may leave little room for the financial BIS Review 61/1997 - 8 - institutions to exercise creativity and  in the end  even discourage them from doing so. In practice  the regulations were applied with a certain degree of flexibility to avoid impairment of market functions. In order to strengthen the competitiveness of the Japanese markets  however  it is essential to resolutely relax or remove existing regulations to allow the private sector to fully exercise its creativity. It then becomes important that market participants be held responsible for their own actions and market discipline be respected  and also that comprehensive rules be made that are applied to the entire market to ensure the adequate functioning of the market mechanism. Such market rules can be summarized conceptually in the following two categories. The first type is rules that financial businesses in general - for example  banks  securities companies  insurance companies  and investment trusts - must observe in their transactions with customers. These include rules that provide for adequate explanation of the risks involved in a certain product in accordance with the customer’s level of knowledge and experience  or for a strict separation of the customers’ assets from the institution’s assets. The second type is rules pertaining to disclosure and those that prohibit unfair trades. The basis of investor protection is to disclose information that enables investors to make rational decisions about investment. With such disclosure  all responsibility for the investment decisions will lie with the investors. It is thus necessary to enhance public disclosure  while considering for which instruments investor protection should be provided. Besides these two types of rules  prudential regulations will need to be imposed on banks which participate in the settlement system. This is because failure of one bank might trigger the materialization of systemic risk  disrupting the entire financial system. However  if the prudential regulations are applied too rigorously  banks may be put at a major disadvantage vis-à-vis other financial institutions. Therefore  banking regulations are now being reviewed so that they encourage further efforts by banks themselves. These rules and regulations should not control the details of the actions of financial institutions. Instead  their aim is to guarantee free and self-reliant behavior of financial institutions within the minimum necessary framework. Relaxation or removal of all unnecessary regulations within that framework should promote competition among financial institutions  improving the quality of financial services available to users in Japan and abroad. C. The Future of the Japanese Financial Markets Before concluding  I would also like to discuss the Bank’s views regarding the future of Japan’s markets  about which questions are often raised. First of all  in light of the experience of the Big Bang in the United Kingdom  some anticipate that when the market reform is accomplished  Japanese financial institutions might end up being acquired by foreign interests. It is extremely difficult to forecast whether this will happen in Japan and to what extent it will occur. However  whoever will be the providers of financial services  what is most important is to establish financial markets which efficiently supply diverse financial services to the people and which thereby provide the foundation for the sound development of the national economy. Even if attempts are made to protect domestic financial institutions by means of market regulation  the cost of that protection will have to be borne by the people  if the financial institutions lack international competitiveness. This would reduce the international competitiveness of Japanese firms and  in the end  might only shackle the economic development of Japan. Following the Big Bang in the United Kingdom  the London market grew once again and consolidated its status as a global market. It is true that in the process  capital of various origins found its way into British financial institutions. This  however  occurred because the London market had the capacity to create new financial techniques  and obviously the subsequent revitalization of the market has contributed to the development of the British economy. BIS Review 61/1997 - 9 - In the end  financial institutions seem to have no choice but to reinforce their financial strength and enhance their competitiveness to survive tough competition. I strongly expect that financial institutions in Japan will further strengthen their competitiveness through efforts to reform themselves  and I am convinced that they remain full of determination in this respect. Another concern in Japan has been that if deregulation proceeds further  many of the small and medium-sized financial institutions will find their business base taken over by the larger institutions. Looking at the situation in Europe and the United States  however  I feel that there is a tendency for financial institutions to become specialized in the present financial environment. While it is true that some financial institutions might seek to provide comprehensive financial services  they will not be able to survive the severe competition by merely expanding the scale and scope of their operations. Those institutions will also have to develop areas or niches in which they can be competitive to secure the base for their existence. It is thus strongly expected that each financial institution will advance its know-how and expertise in its particular areas of strength so as to provide quality financial services. While market reform in Japan will thus intensify competition among financial institutions  I am of the view that it will not directly cause the small and medium-sized financial institutions to lose their business bases. V. Conclusion The reform of the financial markets involves numerous issues besides relaxation and removal of existing regulations and improvement of the institutional framework of the legal  tax  and accounting systems. Review of public financing and adequate regulation and supervision  for example  are important considerations. The revision of the Bank of Japan Law should also be perceived as part of the process of reform of the Japanese financial markets and the financial system. With regard to the revision of the Bank of Japan Law  a bill to amend the entire Law was submitted to the Diet in March following intense deliberations by the Central Bank Study Group  an advisory panel to the Prime Minister  and by the Financial System Research Council  an advisory committee to the Minister of Finance. The bill aims at establishing a new central bank system founded on the two basic principles of independence and transparency. Underlying the amendment proposal is the perception that in order to improve the efficacy and flexibility of monetary policy amid the changes occurring in the global environment surrounding the Japanese financial markets  which I have discussed today  the legislation based on which the Bank of Japan operates must be appropriate for a central bank in the new age. I strongly hope that the bill will have a smooth passage following Diet deliberations. At the same time  we at the Bank of Japan are determined to strengthen our efforts to reform the Bank to ensure appropriate policy and operational management. In closing  I would like to ask for your continued understanding and cooperation. BIS Review 61/1997

George  at the City University Business School in London on 24/6/97.,Mr. George discusses the framework of monetary policy in the UK and Europe Text of the Sixteenth Mais Lecture delivered by the Governor of the Bank of England  Mr. E.A.J. George  at the City University Business School in London on 24/6/97. I was delighted to have been invited to deliver the Sixteenth Mais Lecture - until some two or three months ago when you asked me to suggest a title! I confess that  at that stage  I had not really thought about what I should talk about - so I offered you the portmanteau title of “Monetary policy in Britain and Europe”  hoping  like Mr Micawber  that something would turn up - either here or on the Continent - to give some topicality to what I might say. Well happily  Vice Chancellor  it has. On 6 May  just four days after taking office  the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced some radical changes to the monetary policy framework in this country - including changes to the role and constitution of the Bank of England. I should like to discuss some of those changes this evening against the background of the monetary policy framework being developed in Europe  in preparation for the introduction of the euro  including the role of the future European System of Central Banks (ESCB). But I should like to discuss them in the context of the approach to economic management more generally in Europe and this country and perhaps I might start with that. Overall economic management Sweeping generalisations are of course always dangerous. But from my particular vantage point at least  there has  over the past decade or more  been a clear change of emphasis - across Europe but much more widely internationally - away from short-term  macro- economic  demand management as the means of promoting the agreed end-objectives of economic policy  of growth of output and employment  and of rising living standards  and towards the need for macro-economic stability in the medium and longer term. Where before the implicit assumption appeared to be that the supply side of the economy would respond relatively flexibly to increasing demand  there is now the perception that over-ambitious short-term demand management  which attempts to push capacity to its limits or even beyond  can generate instability and uncertainty  damaging capacity growth in the longer term by distorting economic decision-making in relation to investment  for example  or in relation to resource allocation. The result is a broad consensus - across countries but also across a wide part of the political spectrum within countries - on the need for macro-economic policy to be directed towards stability and sustainability in the medium and longer term. This consensus is reflected in the Maastricht Treaty - through the famous convergence criteria. It is reflected  too  in the arrangements for the conduct of macro-economic policy now being put in place for the introduction of the single European currency - including the monetary preparations for the European Central Bank (ECB)  and the agreement on the fiscal Stability and Growth Pact recently confirmed by the European Council in Amsterdam. But alongside this collective commitment to macro-economic stability  there is a growing recognition that stability  on its own  is not enough. While it may be a necessary condition for achieving sustainable growth of output and employment  and rising living standards - the truly good things in life - and while stability may indeed be the most that macro-economic policy can contribute in the longer term to those agreed end-objectives  it is not in itself a sufficient condition for achieving them. So attention everywhere is now focusing increasingly on the structural characteristics of our economies which essentially determine their underlying  supply-side  rate of capacity growth. BIS Review 65/1997 - 2 - The issue is starkly illustrated by the fact that despite very substantial progress towards macro-economic stability within the European Union as a whole in recent years - including real progress towards effective price stability (with measured inflation now below 2%) and strenuous efforts everywhere to cut back public sector deficits as required by the Maastricht convergence criteria - output has stagnated  growing at an average annual rate of only 1% or so over the past five or six years  and unemployment has risen inexorably  to around 11% across the Union as a whole. And while it is true that activity may now be beginning to recover  the pick-up is very largely driven by external demand - with the domestic economy still depressingly weak. Against this background  the need for greater supply-side flexibility within Europe is increasingly widely acknowledged. And there are elements of a common approach to bringing it about. These were reflected  for example  in the Resolution on Growth and Employment adopted at the European Summit in Amsterdam a week ago  which talks of the need to improve European competitiveness - with special attention to be given “to labour and product market efficiency  the potential for small and medium-sized enterprises to create jobs”. It talks  too  of improving “training and education systems  including life-long learning  work incentives in the tax and benefit systems and reducing non-wage labour costs  in order to increase employability”. But these policy approaches are not well-defined across Europe  and it is probably at this stage stretching a point to speak of even a “broad” consensus on specific approaches in this area. Even where particular needs for change have been identified nationally  recent experience in some countries suggests that there can be formidable resistance to bringing it about. innovation and technological The new Government in this country is clearly joined in the European consensus on the need for macro-economic stability; and it too emphasises the importance of supply-side flexibility  indeed its thinking on supply-side issues clearly influenced the Amsterdam Resolution which I have just mentioned. To quote a recent article by the Chancellor: “The Labour Government is committed to monetary stability so that businesses and families can plan for the future; to fiscal stability; and (on the supply side) to higher levels of investment in both people and business; to a modernisation of our welfare state  and  not least  to free trade and a constructive engagement in Europe.” This country’s approach overall to economic management is  therefore  wholly consistent with that of our European partners; and we start from a somewhat more comfortable position  in which our own recent progress towards greater macro-economic stability has in fact been accompanied by somewhat stronger growth of activity - averaging over 2½% over the past five years - and by a sustained fall in unemployment to around 7¼% on a comparable ILO basis. Monetary management Within this overall economic policy context  there is a particular commitment  throughout the European Union  to monetary stability; and I should like now to consider some of the very recent changes to our own monetary policy framework against that background. BIS Review 65/1997 (i) Objective - 3 - I begin with the objective of monetary policy which  both here and on the Continent  is allocated specific responsibility for achieving and maintaining price stability. The Maastricht Treaty states that “The primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability. Without prejudice to the objective of price stability  the ESCB shall support the general economic policies of the Community....” In his statement to the House of Commons on May 20th  the Chancellor said: “The Bank (of England)’s monetary policy objective will be to deliver price stability  and  without prejudice to this objective  to support the Government’s economic policy  including its objectives for growth and employment.” At this level  our respective missions are effectively identical. But it is important to understand that price stability is not simply an end in itself  but a means to the end of sustainable growth. What in fact we are  in principle  trying to do in maintaining price stability is to keep the growth of monetary demand more or less continuously broadly in line with the underlying capacity growth in the economy - in effect using price stability as an indicator of stability in the economy as a whole. And although we cannot hope to achieve that in practice with any great precision  we can reasonably aspire to help to moderate the economic cycle rather than aggravate it  as so often in the past. The Maastricht Treaty makes no provision for any further definition of the ECB’s primary objective. It is left for the ECB’s Governing Council to determine how to interpret “price stability” in any particular circumstance. Indeed  the ECB will need to decide whether it has a specific target for inflation at all  or whether  operationally  it adopts an intermediate monetary target  or elements of both. In the case of the United Kingdom it is the Chancellor who determines the precise inflation target  which he has subsequently set at 2½% for the Retail Price Index excluding mortgage interest payments; and the Chancellor reserves the right  in extreme economic circumstances  to override the Bank of England’s operational independence in seeking to achieve the Government’s target. In practice  in either case  the degree of latitude that these arrangements apparently provide is likely to be limited by the need to maintain the credibility of the commitment to price stability  with financial markets and with the public at large. But in the United Kingdom at least  where public support for monetary stability is more recently established than it is  for example  in Germany  the elected Government’s public and explicit commitment to low inflation may provide reassurance  and help to secure greater acceptance of the policy. In any event the Bank’s remit under the new arrangements is unmistakably clear. We are charged with delivering the Government’s inflation target. Operationally  that means that we are to aim consistently to achieve 2½% on RPIX as a mid-point  so that  with a balanced distribution of risks  there should be an even chance of outturns - at the end of our two-year forecasting horizon - either above or below 2½%. The measure of our success will be how close we in fact come to 2½%  not on any particular date  but on average over time. BIS Review 65/1997 (ii) Transparency and accountability - 4 - The clear separation of responsibility for setting the inflation target (the political decision) from responsibility for achieving it (the technical decision) also helps to ensure that the Government and the Bank are separately accountable for their respective roles in the monetary policy process. And in this area of accountability  too  there are considerable differences between the arrangements that will apply to the ECB and to ourselves. In the case of the ECB  the Treaty requires that it “shall address an annual report on the activities of the ESCB  and on the monetary policy of both the previous and current year  to the European Parliament  the Council and the Commission  and also to the European Council. The President of the ECB shall present this report to the Council and to the European Parliament  which may hold a general debate on that basis.” In addition  the ECB President and the members of its Executive Board may be invited  or volunteer  to appear before the competent Committees of the European Parliament. In the case of the Bank of England: (i) The minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC) meetings to determine interest rates will be published  identifying how each member voted  with an explanation of why the individuals who voted against were opposed to the majority decision. (ii) The MPC’s performance will be reviewed regularly by a reformed Court of Directors  and the Bank’s Annual Report will be debated in the House of Commons. (iii) The Bank will continue to publish its quarterly Inflation Report  reviewing both the outturn and the prospect for inflation in relation to the target; and the Treasury Select Committee will take evidence from the MPC on the Inflation Report. (iv) And  as Chairman of the MPC  the Governor is required to write an open letter to the Chancellor if inflation strays by more than 1 percentage point either side of the 2½% target. The letter would refer as appropriate to the Inflation Report  and explain why inflation was adrift  how long the divergence was expected to last  and the action taken to bring it back on course. Taken as a whole  these arrangements provide for greater transparency of  and greater accountability for  the technical monetary process than anywhere else in the world. Now I do not suppose  quite honestly  that anyone would particularly enjoy this degree of public scrutiny. But it will certainly help to concentrate the minds of the MPC members  and it is  I believe  a necessary feature of our new arrangements. The technical implementation of monetary policy - even with a very clearly defined objective - is not at all easy at the best of times. We have in practice a single instrument - the short-term interest rate - the precise effects of which on the economy are by no means perfectly understood  including by ourselves. We do know that it can take up to a couple of years or more to have its full effects. So we have to rely substantially on uncertain forecasts that are subject to unforeseeable shocks. Policy judgements in these circumstances are BIS Review 65/1997 - 5 - necessarily an art rather than an exact science  no matter how much we apply science to informing those judgements. And the judgements themselves need to be constantly reviewed and frequently revised as relevant new information becomes available. Transparency in these circumstances can only encourage a better informed public debate and a more sophisticated public understanding of the issues. That in turn can only help to strengthen confidence in the process - unless of course we make a frightful hash of it! I shall be surprised - and somewhat disappointed - if the ECB Governing Council does not go to considerable lengths to explain its policies to the public at large  for similar reasons  even if it is not actually required to do so by statute. (iii) The decision-making framework Reflecting its multinational character  the policy-making body of the ECB  the Governing Council  will comprise the Governors of the participating country central banks plus the six members of the Executive Board. Our own MPC will comprise four “outside” members directly appointed by the Chancellor  together with five Bank executives - the Governor  two Deputy Governors  and two Executive Directors. The common characteristic is that in each case the decision-makers will be professional experts rather than representatives of particular interests. Any doubts that this would in fact be the case in relation to the outside appointments to the MPC were certainly immediately dispelled when the names were announced: together with our inside appointees  they are  as a team  as well qualified professionally for the task we have been set as I can imagine anywhere in the world - and we certainly need all the help we can get. The processes of the Committee are inevitably still evolving. It will  as you would expect  be supported by the whole  considerable  range of the Bank’s monetary  economic  statistical and market expertise  supplemented by intelligence from the Bank’s network of regional agencies  with further front-line input both from the non-executive members of Court and from our wide range of industrial  commercial and financial contacts. The Committee will be closely involved in the preparation of the quarterly Inflation Report  contributing to both the analysis and the forecasts. And  of course  it will meet regularly on pre-announced dates each month - the dates determined by the monthly cycle of statistical information - to take its decisions on monetary policy. These monthly meetings are spread over three days: a whole-day meeting to receive briefings from the Bank staff on the latest developments; an afternoon meeting to identify and discuss the important underlying issues  and any tactical considerations there may be; and a final morning meeting to decide upon any necessary policy action. The Committee will need also to provide for emergency meetings in the event of a crisis  but if we are successful in our task of achieving permanent  long-term  stability I would hope that that will prove to be a very rare occurrence. (iv) Implementation of policy Compared with the complexity of the decision-making process in relation to interest rates  implementation of those decisions is relatively straightforward. In the case of the ECB  the short-term interest rate will basically be contained within a corridor  bounded  at the top  by an overnight lending facility to the commercial banks  and  at the bottom  by an overnight deposit facility in which the banks can place surplus funds. Within the corridor the market interest rate will be steered by means of open market repurchase operations. The ECB may also require commercial banks to hold with the system minimum cash BIS Review 65/1997 - 6 - reserves; and it will offer a limited amount of longer-term credit to commercial banks at market rates; neither of these features appear to us to be necessary for monetary policy purposes  but they represent an element of continuity from the arrangements which currently apply in some prospective member countries. In our own case the arrangements are even simpler. The decision on interest rates will be announced at noon following the final  morning  meeting of the MPC  and the chosen interest rate will be applied in our daily money market operations - mostly these days through repurchase operations in gilt-edged securities. Limited facilities for late lending to the remaining discount houses and the settlement banks are available to ensure the smooth functioning of the payments system at the end of the day. Looking at the monetary policy arrangements  planned for Europe and as they now are in this country  as a whole  it is clear that while there are significant differences of detail - such that our own arrangements would certainly require considerable further modification to make them compatible with membership of the ESCB - the essential similarities are much greater than the differences. Crucially  the primary monetary policy objective of price stability is the same  and the responsibility for achieving that objective is in each case entrusted to a broadly based group of technical experts not subject to political influence. That does not of course guarantee that we will  here or in Europe  succeed in achieving permanently greater stability but  perhaps presumptuously  I do think it gives us every chance of doing so. Concluding remarks Mr Chairman  what I have tried to do this evening is to draw attention to what I see as a very striking coincidence of basic approach to economic - and in particular monetary - management within Europe but also between Continental Europe and this country. We are clearly  it seems to me  on parallel tracks as far as our commitment to macro-economic  both fiscal and monetary  stability is concerned  though we may be travelling at different speeds when it comes to supply-side flexibility. That coincidence of basic approach is a prerequisite for sustainable economic convergence within Europe - without it I do not see how monetary union could be on the agenda. But the question that is often then put to me is  if in fact we are on parallel tracks - in terms of our basic approach - why then do we not get on the same train and commit ourselves to joining monetary union. So let me conclude with just a few remarks on that subject. The potential attraction of travelling together with our European partners is very clear. There would  other things equal  be real economic advantages in exchange rate certainty across the single market area  which can only be realised through the single currency. The same certainty cannot be achieved by independently pursuing macro-economic discipline  although that should over time help to minimise the degree of intra-European exchange rate volatility. the countries of Europe But there are real risks. We are not all starting from the same station. Domestic demand in this country  for example  is currently growing at a rate which we cannot sustain for very long without the emergence of inflationary pressures. In the major countries of Continental Europe  on the other hand  domestic demand remains  as I say  relatively subdued. The possibility of such cyclical divergences will not simply disappear on January 1st 1999 and they would seriously complicate BIS Review 65/1997 - 7 - the operation of a single monetary policy. So too would a variety of possible internal or external shocks which affected euro member countries in different ways or to different degrees. But more fundamentally - and I can’t keep up the railway analogy - I am frankly nervous at the prospect of introducing the euro at a time of very high and very different rates of unemployment across Europe. It is not that I think unemployment can be addressed directly by more expansionary macro-economic polices - that ought to be clear from my earlier remarks. I share the view that unemployment needs to be addressed fundamentally through supply-side policies - though it may be that the problem is currently being aggravated in the short term by the heroic attempts being made to meet the fiscal criteria according to the Maastricht timetable in a context of cyclical weakness. The problem is that we cannot be confident how individual countries may respond to this situation. My concern is that the persistence of these wholly unacceptable levels of unemployment across Europe  and the very real difficulty of implementing appropriate supply-side reforms  could begin to undermine public support for macro-economic stability in some countries - even though significant relaxation on this front would provide at best only short-term relief. In that case  economic convergence  if it were achieved  could prove difficult to sustain. There are perhaps some suggestions that this may be beginning to happen; and it may be for this reason that the foreign exchange markets are implying that they expect relative euro weakness - to our own considerable embarrassment as a result of the corresponding strength of sterling’s exchange rate. I have no doubt that  if the euro goes ahead  the ECB would in fact seek determinedly to exercise its statutory responsibility for maintaining price stability within the euro area. But its job would be enormously more difficult if this came to be seen  at least in some countries  within the euro area - however mistakenly - as an obstacle to the end-objectives of economic policy  including particularly increasing employment. My conclusion  Mr Chairman  from all this is that whether or not the euro proceeds on the present timetable  and whether or not the UK is a part of that  the really important thing for European prosperity is that the present broad policy consensus holds together. But if we are to be able to hold on to macro-economic stability - as we must - then we have to find answers to the urgent problem of European unemployment. That involves addressing the problems of supply-side flexibility as an immediate priority. And that  Vice Chancellor  is the message that the new Government has recently carried to Europe.

Jean-Claude Trichet  on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Land central bank of Rheinland-Palatinate and the Saarland in Mainz on 2/6/97.,Mr. Trichet discusses Franco-German monetary cooperation and monetary union Speech by the Governor of the Bank of France  M. Jean-Claude Trichet  on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Land central bank of Rheinland-Palatinate and the Saarland in Mainz on 2/6/97. It is a great honour to speak in Mainz today and to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Land central bank of Rheinland-Palatinate and the Saarland. Everybody knows that Mainz played a decisive role in spreading culture and ideas in Europe  in particular thanks to the invention of printing by Gutenberg. And the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of your institution gives me the opportunity to underline once again the prominent role played by the Bundesbank for the stability  credibility and prosperity of the German economy. As you know  the Banque de France deeply supports this culture of stability  which sets the basis for monetary cooperation between France and Germany  the basis for European monetary union. The celebration of an anniversary is a good opportunity to draw lessons from the past and to foresee the future. That is why I have decided today to speak about Franco-German monetary cooperation during the last fifty years and the prospects for monetary union. In this respect  the creation of the single currency on January 1st  1999 is a major event for our respective countries. Far from being a breaking off with the past  the creation of monetary union is the logical crowning of Franco-German monetary cooperation. Indeed: - Franco-German monetary cooperation is based on solid foundations and has steadily developed during the last fifty years (1) - this cooperation will be crowned by the creation of monetary union in 1999 (2). FRANCO-GERMAN MONETARY COOPERATION IS BASED ON SOLID FOUNDATIONS AND HAS STEADILY DEVELOPED DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS In order not to bother you by an unduly long speech  I will focus on the last fifty years only! Nevertheless  one could easily demonstrate that our respective monetary histories have been deeply linked since the Middle Ages. Indeed  Emperor Charlemagne enacted a bill creating a unit of account common to its whole empire  which enshrined most of the present territories of France and Germany. The global features of the system (in particular the subdivisions) experienced an exceptional longevity of almost 1000 years. The last fifty years constitute  however  a rather homogeneous period  during which Franco-German monetary cooperation really developed. First  it is useful to underline the solid roots and foundations of this cooperation. These foundations paved the way for the emergence of a common destiny  which is best illustrated by the creation of the EMS. This community of views and interests have been crucial in the decision to create a European monetary union and a single currency. I will first explain the solid roots and foundations on which Franco-German monetary cooperation is based Franco-German monetary cooperation is based on historical and economic foundations. identified. The historical roots of Franco-German monetary cooperation can easily be BIS Review 63/1997 - 2 - Both countries had first to rebuild the whole economy in 1945  in a period when sacrifices were difficult to impose on populations. Germany tackled these disturbances rapidly and efficiently. The monetary reform implemented in 1948  aimed at definitively eradicating inflation  paved the way for monetary stability and economic prosperity. A new currency - the Deutschemark - was introduced  and a strong and independent central bank was founded. France followed a similar strategy with the creation of the “nouveau franc” or “new franc”  whose nominal value was 100 “anciens francs” or “old francs”. This reform contributed to stabilizing the French currency  which did not experience any devaluation for ten years. In 1971  the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the currency instability which followed convinced European Governments that an exchange rate system had to be set up. The first experience  known as the Snake  was not completely successful  but was the first step towards a common monetary destiny between European countries. As far as economic foundations are concerned  our two economies have been increasingly interlinked for decades. First of all  the various obstacles to foreign trade in Europe have been progressively lifted. Indeed  the Treaty of Rome signed in 1957 aimed at creating a common market. The removal of all sorts of barriers to trade proved nevertheless difficult to achieve. That is why the European authorities felt that another step was indispensable  and signed the Single Act in 1987. By now all persons  goods  services and capital can move freely from one country to another. This is the case for France and Germany. Trade is a good example of this integration. The share of French imports coming from Germany is currently about 19%  while the share of German imports coming from France is about 15%. Each country is the other's first trading partner. Beyond these gross figures  it is interesting to note that this trade is largely made of complementary goods as opposed to substitutable goods  thus increasing interdependence. This interdependence is more generally macroeconomic. Econometric work has indeed shown that French and German GDPs are closely correlated. This means that national economic policies cannot deviate excessively from each other. is not only commercial  it These foundations progressively convinced France and Germany that they needed a common monetary destiny As I said earlier  the collapse of the Bretton Woods system led European Governements to organize monetary relations between each other. France and Germany were among the most prominent actors in this strategy. I personally see two main elements in this common destiny: the creation of the European monetary system (EMS) in 1979 and the emergence of a conceptual convergence between our two countries as regards monetary issues. The creation of the European Monetary System in March 1979 highlights best the cooperation between France and Germany. The EMS not only provided exchange rate stability through the setting-up of formal fluctuation bands between currencies; it also organized a monetary solidarity between countries  by providing compulsory interventions and related financing facilities. BIS Review 63/1997 - 3 - Although the very first years of the EMS were characterized by several currency realignments  due to insufficient nominal convergence between countries  the system progressively contributed to exchange rate stability. German monetary policy  based on stability and credibility  proved to be efficient. In this context  the French authorities fully endorsed the objectives and disciplines of the EMS and embarked on monetary and exchange rate stability. The years that followed were characterized by increasing convergence between countries and fewer realignments. All countries  including new participants in the system  adopted similar strategies. Although satisfactory in theory  this stance was nevertheless difficult to follow for some economies still facing imbalances  and in particular a lack of competitiveness. This explains partly the crises that occurred in 1992 and 1993. I cannot forget how efficient Franco-German cooperation was during this difficult period. This concrete cooperation has also been made possible by the emergence of a conceptual convergence as regards monetary issues. Since 1987  the central rate of the French franc within the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) has been unchanged  and a virtuous disinflation process has been taking place. This policy has allowed French short-term and long-term interest rates to decline steadily and to stand at similar levels to those reached by the best performers within the EMS. And a consensus has emerged in France that monetary policy should be shielded from short-term influences and short-termist strategies and placed in the framework of a medium and long-term strategy of credibility. In this respect  a decisive step was the decision to grant independence to the Banque de France in late 1993. This reform was based on a new perception by the French populace of the role of a central bank in a developed country. The last three years have shown that independence was not merely a theoretical concept; the Banque de France has adopted its monetary policy and has made its own decisions  according to the law without any interference from the Government. The Banque de France has steadily increased its credibility among market participants and other observers. The stability culture that has developed in France during the last decade is deeply rooted in French society itself. A strong consensus now exists in favour of a stable currency backed by an independent central bank and contributing to preserving the purchasing power of the currency  and thereby the purchasing power of citizens. That is why Franco-German monetary cooperation made the case for European monetary union more obvious Indeed it is clear that a single market is more efficient if it is backed by exchange-rate stability. Excessive exchange-rate volatility and misalignments are invisible barriers to trade  since they increase uncertainty and create inappropriate and erratic competitive fluctuations. Moreover  in an environment characterized by free capital movements  isolated monetary strategies are made more difficult. There is thus a need for monetary coordination  whose ultimate form is the creation of a monetary union and a single currency. France and Germany have had no difficulty in understanding this development and are deeply involved in the preparatory work for EMU. The Maastricht Treaty contains clear and efficient monetary provisions by setting specific deadlines for the creation of a single currency and by organizing three separate stages BIS Review 63/1997 - 4 - for this process. These stages allow for a progressive but logical move to monetary union  which ensures that the single currency will rest on solid foundations. Moreover  the independence of the European System of Central Banks  made up of the European Central Bank and national central banks which is fully warranted by the Treaty  will guarantee price stability and the credibility of the single currency. Last  the Treaty allows for a balanced policy mix based on an independent monetary policy and appropriate fiscal discipline (in this respect  the stability and growth pact is a useful “user guide” to the provisions of the Treaty and not a new constraint coming from nowhere). We are now in the implementation phase of the monetary provisions of the Maastricht Treaty. The concrete preparations of monetary union are the responsibility of the European Monetary Institute. The preparatory work is well on track and will allow the ESCB to perform its tasks right from the start of Stage Three in January 1999; moreover  the EMI is often consulted by other European authorities  who pay careful attention to the advice it provides; this was notably the case for the changeover scenario adopted by the Heads of State and of Government in Madrid in December 1995  and for the elaboration of draft regulations concerning the legal framework for the use of the euro. Here again  France and Germany are playing a very active role in these preparations  and as early as tomorrow I will meet President Tietmeyer in Frankfurt  together with our colleagues  to attend the monthly EMI Council meeting. FRANCO-GERMAN MONETARY COOPERATION WILL ULTIMATELY BE CROWNED BY THE CREATION OF A EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION IN 1999 I am personally convinced that the creation of monetary union in 1999 is the logical consequence of economic  monetary and financial developments that have been taking place during the past years. The increasing integration of the European economies - and in particular those of France and Germany - called for a single monetary policy and a single currency. I am also convinced that monetary union will successfully go through  right from 1999 since: - it is a credible process; - it will create an environment of stability. EMU is a credible process Indeed  the case for a European monetary union is based on solid economic grounds  and it will be implemented in a realistic way. EMU is not just some abstract concept dreamed up by a few people. It is based on solid economic grounds. When the exchange rate stability provided by the Bretton Woods system and by the barriers between national financial markets disappeared in the 1970s  a number of European governments became progressively convinced of the need for a single currency. The Maastricht Treaty is indeed the result of past major initiatives  such as the Werner Report in 1970 and the Delors report in 1989. BIS Review 63/1997 - 5 - The removal of all tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade has made Europe the largest market in the world. The EU accounts for 21% of total world trade  against 17% for the US and 10% for Japan. The benefits of the sheer size of the Single Market are plain to see. The allocation of savings and investments is more efficient  competition is stronger  and the greater liquidity of financial markets makes more capital available at lower cost to finance profitable ventures. No doubt the European Monetary System and its Exchange Rate Mechanism have helped curb exchange rate instability and eradicate the inflation culture that prevailed in some countries; yet the current level of economic and business integration calls for the Europeans to take a further step towards monetary integration  for the benefit of all European economic agents and citizens. The benefits of the single currency are clear. It will reduce uncertainty and facilitate production and investment decisions. It will make price comparisons across Europe more transparent and reduce transaction costs. In addition  the single currency area will enjoy price stability and sound public finances  which will lead to a high level of confidence and to low market interest rates. Last but not least  the euro will be a major international currency and this will facilitate international monetary cooperation. EMU is not only based on solid economic grounds. It is also a realistic economic process. EMU is based on convergence criteria which have to be met on a sustainable basis. The fulfilment of the convergence criteria is not only a legal condition for participating in EMU but  of course  corresponds to the sound policy management which is in the interest of all Member States. I am convinced that EMU will create an environment of stability I know how important the concept of stability is to the German people. This culture of stability  which explains to a large extent the economic success of your country  is shared by many Governments  central banks and citizens all over Europe  not least in France. I know that the German people have expressed some qualms about the disappearance of the Deutschemark and its replacement by the euro. But I will try to convince you that the euro will be as stable as the Deutschemark  as stable as the French franc today  for the sake of European economic prosperity and growth. Indeed  EMU will contribute to reinforcing stability in Europe. EMU will bring legal  fiscal and monetary stability. EMU requires a sound legal basis to foster the credibility of the changeover to the single currency. The Madrid European Council asked the Commission to prepare a draft Council regulation on the legal framework for the use of the euro. This regulation is of the utmost importance. Market participants need legal certainty  not only as regards the new instruments in euro  but also as regard the continuity of instruments denominated in the former national currencies or in ECU. Besides financial markets  legal certainty is also important for citizens  as the emergence of a new currency is inevitably  at the first stage  a source of uncertainties. In this respect  technical preparatory work on the legal framework for the use of the euro is almost achieved. The European regulations that have been drafted and should be endorsed by the European Council in Amsterdam clearly state that the euro will be the BIS Review 63/1997 - 6 - currency of the European monetary union as from the 1.1.1999 . As a consequence  the national currencies  in particular notes and coins  will continue to circulate during a transitional period  as subdivisions of the euro. Two other key elements are that the changeover will ensure the continuity of existing contracts denominated either in national currencies or in ECU and that the ECU will become the euro at a rate of 1 to 1. Besides legal security  EMU will reinforce monetary stability in Europe. The Maastricht Treaty provides for a monetary framework very similar to that prevailing in Germany and in France. The primary objective of the European System of Central Banks (made up of the European Central Bank and national central banks) will be price stability. The ECB Council of Governors (only those of countries participating in monetary union) will decide independently the level of official interest rates. Representatives of the European Council may attend the ECB Council meetings  but they will not participate in the voting procedure. Monetary union will be characterized by a single monetary policy and national fiscal policies. In this context  the issue of fiscal discipline and coordination is crucial. Sound fiscal policies will help the ESCB to maintain price stability. Coordinated fiscal policies will contribute to a balanced policy mix in Europe. Fiscal discipline will prevent free-rider strategies by countries running large deficits and raising funds at low interest rates  thanks to the credibility and stability of other countries. This question of European fiscal discipline is important in the context of the main criticisms which are presently enumerated  particularly from outside Europe  in the analysis of the concept of EMU. Without being exhaustive in this listing  I personally see four major criticisms: First  it is sometimes argued that EMU will lead to greater rigidity  in diverting attention from the necessary structural reforms and inducing an inward-looking posture over Europe at the very moment when global competition is of the essence. Secondly  the difficulty of delivering an appropriate “policy-mix”  the monetary policy being by definition concentrated in the hands of the ECB and the ESCB when  at the same time  the absence of a federal government and therefore of a federal budget leaves the fiscal policy of the Union in the hands of 15 different governments. Thirdly  the difficulty of absorbing “shocks” in a particular member economy  whether this shock is of a domestic or an external nature. This difficulty stems in particular from the absence of the automatic stabilizers of fiscal transfers because there is no federal budget. Fourthly  it is stressed that there are important costs associated with the transition towards EMU  namely the necessity to reduce overall fiscal deficits in the run-up to the single currency in accordance with the Maastricht fiscal criteria and the necessity to embark on an excessively tough monetary policy after the creation of the single currency to ensure the global credibility of the ECB  which in this view will start from scratch. Let me respond to these criticisms and try to demonstrate that the Europeans have embarked upon a coherent economic and monetary strategy  responding as accurately as possible to the various questions I have just listed and paying due attention to the special nature of the European endeavour. BIS Review 63/1997 - 7 - As regards the first criticism  which I call the “diverting from structural reform” argument  I really think that it rests on a misunderstanding of the very nature of the Monetary Union: the essence of EMU is the completion of the single market  which has been one of the boldest structural reforms ever launched in industrialized countries. On top of the common market which was the initial concept of the Treaty of Rome  the single market is marshalling the elimination of all non-tariff barriers  of all those barriers that are of a structural nature and are hampering the smooth circulation of goods  services and capital throughout the European Union. In order to meet the single market targets  workshops have been set up everywhere in Europe in all sectors of the economy and in all capitals to embark on the modernization and harmonization of regulations of all kinds. It is a major medium-term endeavour and an indispensable economic impetus to foster competition  economic growth and job creation throughout the single market. In this perspective  the single currency appears as the last decisive messier for the completion of the single market  eliminating the last barriers that still exist within the European Union: no more additional costs for transactions  no more exchange risks  either justifiable or not amenable to appropriate hedging  and no more costs associated with these hedging mechanisms. Throughout the single market  there will be the same visibility of all prices  thus permitting immediate price comparisons  cost comparisons and therefore fostering competition in all markets. My conclusion on this point is that the single currency will not prevent Europe from embarking on eliminating economic rigidities  inducing market flexibilities and generating measures to cope efficiently and successfully with global competition. On the contrary  the single currency endeavour will help foster the structural reforms that are needed in Europe to improve growth prospects and job creation and counter unemployment. The second and third criticisms are based upon the argument that the Europeans will not set up an optimum currency area like the US because of the absence of a federal government and a federal budget and therefore that there is no possibility of ensuring an appropriate consolidated fiscal policy and ensuring shock absorption through automatic stabilizing transfers. In my eyes  the Maastricht Treaty gives a pertinent response to these pertinent questions. The thrust of the spirit and of the letter of the Treaty is that everything is done to construct the euro area as an optimum currency area. First by ensuring that it incorporates economies that have already proved being convergent in the fiscal field as well as in the monetary and financial fields. This is why the so-called five Maastricht criteria are important. Not only can one expect that a particular economy meeting the five criteria is clearly eligible to belong to a currency area composed of other economies with the same fiscal  monetary and financial features but one can also expect that the business cycles in these economies are likely to be largely synchronized. Convergence from the very beginning of the single currency is a necessary condition to create an optimum currency area. But convergence is not only necessary at the moment of the selection of member economies. It is also necessary afterwards in what we could call the permanent regime of the euro. And then the stability and growth pact is of the essence. It calls for each country to remain in a sound position as regards its fiscal behaviour. There is a paradox enshrined in the stability and growth pact: implementing the Maastricht Treaty provisions  including sanctions vis-à-vis past behaviour  it places more power BIS Review 63/1997 - 8 - in the hands of the „centre“  which is in that case the Council  say Brussels  vis-à-vis member states than is the case  for example  for the US government vis-à-vis Texas or California. The absence of a significant federal budget and the absence of a federal government have driven the Europeans to embark upon a direct coordination of their national fiscal postures  through direct peer pressures and decisions within the Council of Ministers. This very bold construction  which has no worldwide equivalent in the world  will simultaneously permit through the decision-making process that has been decided in Dublin: - to ensure that we have a sound consolidated fiscal policy at the level of the euro area even without a federal budget  - and to ensure that each particular economy reloads the fiscal cannon in order to be able to cope with domestic or external shocks even without the automatic stabilizers of the transfers built into a federal budget. Ensuring a sound consolidated fiscal policy at the level of the Union and reloading the fiscal cannon at the level of national economies are the two major goals of the stability and growth pact monitored by the Stability Council and decided  in accordance with the Treaty  by the Council itself. As regards the costs associated with the transition towards the euro  which were the fourth major criticism  I will confine myself to two main remarks relating to the fiscal side as well as to the monetary side. From a European perspective  the strategies of fiscal retrenchment that have been decided within the European Union are to be implemented in any event  whether the Maastricht Treaty existed or not. There is no doubt that even in a pure  selfish  domestic approach in each of the European countries  meeting the fiscal criteria would be welcome for the sake of the economy  for the sake of the appropriate financing of the competitive sector  for the sake of the credibility of the signature of the State  for the sake of the confidence in the currency and therefore for the sake of growth  job creation and the fight against unemployment. All European governments are saying that Maastricht or no Maastricht  they would pursue their sound fiscal policies and strategies. In the case of France  the proof is even easier. For it was in June 1982 that France adopted the 3 % rule  on the basis of a multipartisan consensus and for domestic reasons  ten years before the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. As regards the monetary side of the coin  shall I also say that we in the Banque de France would pursue exactly the same kind of monetary policy based on low inflation  exchange rate stability  a high level of credibility and confidence  and therefore a low level of long-term interest rates. Implementing what our law says  namely price stability  through exchange rate stability and the monitoring of our domestic monetary aggregates  the French independent central bank would meet spontaneously on pure domestic considerations the three Maastricht criteria that are in our monetary and financial domain  namely a low level of inflation  a low level of long-term market rates and exchange rate stability. For these reasons  I see no extra cost associated with the fiscal and monetary policies that are consistent with progress towards monetary union. BIS Review 63/1997 - 9 - The question of the costs associated with the launching of the ECB and the ESCB is also important. The question arises only to the extent that the ECB is supposed to start from scratch and has to build credibility on its own. But it is certainly not the spirit nor the letter of the Maastricht Treaty; it is certainly not the very nature of the monetary concept of the single currency. The single currency is neither supposed to start from scratch  nor to result from the averaging of the various currencies that exist within the European Union. It must clearly and it will according to the convergence concept  have the legacy of the most credible and solid currencies participating in the ERM mechanism. The euro  in any case  must be as solid and credible as are the most credible currencies in Europe. In conclusion  I would like to make three points - Firstly  it is not only monetary union that we are preparing actively  but also economic union  i.e. political union in the economic field. We should not forget that the Treaty itself provides for a higher degree of political union than is usually acknowledged  with the concept of coordination of economic policies and the provisions for fiscal discipline and sanctions. The stability and growth pact grants important powers to the Council - i.e. the Council of national Governments which is the equivalent in Europe of a federal government in a political federation. - Secondly  one should not underestimate the degree of monetary stability already achieved by European countries. Monetary stability is not only a project for the future  it is already a major achievement in many European countries. For example  seven countries have been participating in the ERM without any change in their central parities for more than ten years. - Thirdly  it is a false perception to view the necessary fiscal consolidation and monetary stability as constraints imposed by the Maastricht Treaty against the very interests of European countries. We would be implementing the same economic policies if there were no Maastricht Treaty  since they are based on some principles of sound economic management which are necessary to create jobs and tackle the problem of unemployment. Finally  economic and monetary union and the creation of the euro will crown economic and monetary cooperation between European countries  notably France and Germany which are the two pillars of it  and will foster prosperity  stability and peace in the European Union.

I The old German folk tale about the stars that fall from the sky as thalers is a dream that  on the European stage  has largely come to an end. The single currency will not fall into the lap of the nations of Europe - at least not as a stable payment medium. The arduous struggle for strict and lasting compliance with the convergence criteria - precisely here in Germany  too - shows that a stable euro is more like a valuable treasure buried in a field. At present  some work is still needed to uncover it. And it will require further energy to guard the euro’s stability on a lasting basis. In saying that  the realisation that it is not possible to make good policy with bad money has  in fact  gained some ground over the past few years. There has been a growing general recognition of the fact that as stable a general price level as possible is an indispensable precondition for long-term growth which promotes employment and fosters social cohesion. Stability and employment are not mutually exclusive. Indeed  I am pleased that the Amsterdam summit seems to have realised this. The encouraging increase in price stability in Europe is also a result of the preparations for monetary union  however. In 1996  the average rate of inflation in the EU countries was no more than 2.5 %  for example  and is likely to be even less in 1997. The financial markets react very sensitively nowadays to political and economic changes that herald risks of inflation. It is possible that higher interest rates and exchange rate reactions will then quickly follow. As a consequence  the globalised financial markets are increasingly also becoming guardians of stability. Since price stability is simultaneously making headway worldwide  too  there are some commentators who already go as far as pronouncing inflation to be “dead”. Does that mean that safeguarding monetary stability is not a perpetual challenge after all? II An animated debate is taking place  not only in the United States  on the question of whether moving even closer to a stable price level might do more harm than good in macroeconomic terms. The losses in output and employment during the course of a further reduction in inflation might  in the view of some  be higher than the gains in stability that are still to be achieved. It is also argued that a moderate inflation rate might promote employment  given  say  that the labour markets are not very flexible and that nominal wages show a certain ratchet effect. It might additionally contribute to lower real interest rates. From my point of view  these arguments point in the wrong direction. Firstly  the rightly deplored distortions due to time-lags in wage and price formation are seldom long-term in nature. And  secondly  attempting to use monetary means to solve problems in the real economy inevitably leads to an inflationary dead end. Such an attempt overrates the ability of economic policy to control real processes and  at the same time  unwarrantably underestimates the controllability of inflationary processes once they have been set in motion. BIS Review 64/1997 - 2 - The advantages of lasting price stability are obvious  however. Fundamentally  they accrue without any time limit and every year. That is also true when a high degree of stability has already been achieved. Overall economic costs arise  even in the case of inflation that is fully anticipated. That is because any monetary erosion has the effect of a tax on cash held. Prices and contracts  too  have to be adjusted regularly. Even a moderate rise in the general price level may imply appreciable uncertainty for economic agents. It is only with difficulty that the future rate of inflation can be assessed. The risk involved in long-term nominal contracts increases. An inflation premium is added to interest rates in the capital market. In a system of taxation that is based on nominal variables  moderate monetary erosion also makes the tax burden rise. With increasing rates of taxation  even growth in revenue that is merely inflation-induced is subject to increasingly higher taxation (so-called “cold” progression). And the nominally constant exemption limits lose their value in real terms. Above all  that places a strain on capital income and leads to significant growth losses as a result of lower savings  as has been established by Martin Feldstein  for instance. The costs associated with hedging financial transactions against inflationary risks is likewise considerable. For you  as players in the financial markets  that may be a lucrative business. You will probably agree with me  however  that - in macroeconomic terms - there are definitely more productive ways of investing money. In addition  stable money avoids the negative consequences for income and wealth distribution and hence the risk of societal conflict. Whereas  given inflation  creditors make arbitrary and unearned gains  it is the recipients of transfer income and the owners of monetary assets who are the losers. I am thinking  in particular  of the small savers who wish to make additional provision for old age. Given 3 % inflation over a period of ten years  their monetary assets lose no less than one quarter of their purchasing power  for example. Thus  looked at over a longer period of time  attempts to moderate a high standard of stability are not at all worthwhile. Internal stability is and remains the sole genuine seal of approval for a good currency. That is the sole basis on which confidence in the monetary system will grow  on which millions of efficient processes of exchange in the goods  factor and financial markets can be organised every day  and on which economic relationships that are sustainable in the long term can be established. For that reason  monetary stability is - and will remain - a perpetual challenge even in the age of moderate rates of inflation. III That applies quite particularly with a view to European monetary union. If the euro is not given the stability seal of approval by the financial markets and the general public from the outset  the project of monetary union will be standing - economically and politically - on feet of clay. But how can the euro be given stability from the start  apart from the future ECB pursuing a consistent and stability-oriented monetary policy? I wish to highlight three aspects. 1. Fiscal policy in the participating countries must regain its room for manoeuvre. A glance at the public sector budgets in the majority of member states shows how narrow the financial scope has become everywhere following the many years of accumulating debt and the expansion of the public sector. The vicious circle of growing indebtedness and of ever-higher interest burdens pushes other tasks into the background and calls for higher and BIS Review 64/1997 - 3 - higher taxes and levies. That is especially the case in those countries with retirement provision and health care based on the “pay as you go” principle  and which are faced with considerable demographic challenges. In a large number of European countries  the government ratio and the taxes and social security ratio have now reached such orders of magnitude that they are threatening to strangle the economy’s power of innovation  and putting more and more jobs at risk. This process must be corrected if prospects for growth and employment are to be improved on a lasting basis. For that reason - irrespective of monetary union - sustained consolidation is a pressing need. Short-term one-off actions or a relaxation of the Maastricht fiscal criteria would  in may view  give the wrong signals. That would only encourage the disastrous illusion that the financial position is still bearable or that it will improve automatically at a later date. Moreover  it would reduce the salutary pressure to reform exerted by the Maastricht process. Urgent adjustments would then probably continue to be put on hold - and place an even heavier burden on the future. An unsound fiscal policy and a strict monetary policy do not go together in the longer term. The distortions in the shape of economic costs  due to higher interest rates  employment and growth losses  may become very large. That is the reason why  under Article 109j of the Maastricht Treaty  all the European countries must make efforts to achieve “the sustainability of the government financial position” beyond the starting date. In all probability  the supranational monetary policy of the ECB will  in the event of a conflict  find it difficult enough as it is to withstand the political pressure of fiscal  economic and pay-rate policies which remain national in Europe. For that reason  2. the independence of the European System of Central Banks enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty must not be infringed. By dispensing with the exchange rate  the participating countries will be doing without the mechanism which they were previously able to use to cushion differences between countries in terms of inflation  productivity or the growth of government debt. In the euro currency area  there will be no comprehensive financial adjustment scheme in support of economically weaker countries. The countries lack the money and probably the willingness for large-scale transfer payments. The burden of adjustment in the case of changes in productivity and demand will lie almost exclusively with national labour costs. Wages and wage-related levies must be geared to differences in productivity  otherwise unemployment will easily occur. If wages are not sufficiently flexible  however  there will be a great danger that pressure for actionism will soon be directed to the single monetary policy. That is because experience teaches us that policy makers easily fall prey to the temptation to side-step the pressure of structural problems by means of a little extra inflation. Given differing trends between countries  however  that could also easily lead to conflicts between them. In Germany  the Bundesbank has always been able to rely on its anti-inflationary policy having the broad support of the general public  and to defend its independence against any political pressure. That has become apparent again during the past few weeks. And the confidence which the markets have always shown in the Bundesbank is based on such experience. The European Central Bank still has to earn that confidence  however. As I understand things  this will be all the easier  the greater is the stock of confidence introduced by the national central banks from their own countries. In other words: the more persistently policy BIS Review 64/1997 - 4 - makers in all the participating countries champion the independence of the European Central Bank and then also respect its monetary policy decisions. For the euro to be successful  however  it is also important for 3. the European countries to solve their structural problems and to face up to the new challenges. The resolution of the European Council on growth and employment states that “... it should be a priority aim to develop a skilled  trained and adaptable workforce and to make labour markets responsive to economic change. Structural reforms need to be comprehensive in scope ...” That statement is actually true. Apart from that  it has little to do with monetary union per se. Those problems and challenges exist anyway: persistently high unemployment  for example  which - even with a cyclical upturn - is unlikely to fall significantly without structural changes; in a large number of countries  the welfare state is increasingly reaching - or has already reached - the point where it cannot go any further in terms of funding; demographic trends call for timely adjustments in health care and retirement provision; advancing economic globalisation is intensifying competition and calls for new thinking and action. Those are undoubtedly only some of the tasks. We are all aware of the pressing problems in our own countries. Each country must find its own  nationally appropriate solution. For it is certain that the euro will  if anything  further intensify competition to win inward investment within Europe. At the same time  Europe’s structural weaknesses will be revealed more starkly in an international comparison. No one should indulge in any illusions. The euro cannot pay off past debts nor can it eliminate unemployment that has already been created. On the contrary  increasing demands will be placed on the participating countries as a result of them dispensing with their own exchange rate and interest rate policies. The problems that exist must therefore be solved  if possible  before entry into monetary union. It is precisely in the case of economic divergence in the euro area that each participating country must be adaptable enough to manage without the emergency escape route of altering the exchange rate. It is only if each participating country is competitive on its own terms that the single Europe will be able to assume a leading role as an economic region in the future. In Germany  the realisation that change is necessary is gradually beginning to gain acceptance. The road which leads from realising that to the necessary reform is still an arduous one at times  however - especially during the run-up to the elections: “We do not have a problem of perception  but rather a problem of implementation.” BIS Review 64/1997 - 5 - That statement by the Federal President  Roman Herzog  puts the present situation in Germany in a nutshell. What we now need more than anything  therefore  is the courage and the determination to redefine the priorities of government and the public sector. Reliable underlying conditions politically in the longer term are important for giving investors certainty. Further steps must also be taken towards labour markets that are more flexible  even if management and labour have already made some moves in that direction. And  overall  we need a greater degree of personal responsibility and private initiative in order to find innovative solutions to structural rigidities. Without doubt  those countries under the umbrella of a single currency that act quickly and fully on the basis the lessons that have been learned will be those which are best able to hold their own. Anyone who puts off the necessary reforms might easily fall behind even further in competing as an industrial location. I hope that all the countries which are pushing for entry into monetary union are aware of that fact. IV The European financial markets are under pressure to adjust  too  of course. Some countries - such as Germany with the D-Mark as the second most important reserve and investment currency in the world - will lose their currency-related “bonus”  whereas others will strengthen their position  which was weaker hitherto because of their currency. In the monetary union  the formerly national European capital markets will draw much closer together. Currency and interest rate differentials will no longer matter. Despite that  it is unlikely that a completely uniform market will come into existence. Certain special national regulations will still be in force - in the case of taxation of investment income  for instance. Nevertheless  I still hope that there will be a growing recognition that further progress in harmonisation is an urgent necessity. In practice  issues having the same terms are still likely to show limited differences in yields. Yield differentials will then mainly be due to the differences in the standing of the issuers and the differing liquidity of the issues. Higher demands will be placed on public sector national debt management because currency will no longer act as a “screen”. Even now  the globalisation of the financial markets is calling for a widespread application of international standards. The euro is likely to encourage that trend. A reliable political regulatory framework and an efficient structure in the national financial markets will then become crucial assets in competing for capital that is in short supply. What implications do these developments have for the European financial markets? At present  there are still a large number of stock markets and futures exchanges in the European Union which have a wide variety of market models and trading systems. As in the financial industry as a whole  the pressure of competition and advances in communication technology will lead to a process of adjustment and concentration. But the debate on the future of Europe’s financial centres is also connected with questions concerning the set of instruments that the European System of Central Banks will have at its disposal. BIS Review 64/1997 - 6 - The Bundesbank attaches great importance to the monetary policy strategy - including the instruments belonging to it - being implemented in a way that leaves competition unaffected  and which does not discriminate against any financial centre in the euro area. We do not want any privileges for Frankfurt  but we do not want any disadvantages either. Along with the national central banks  which will carry the main weight of operational activities  the European Central Bank must itself have its own limited field of operations. That is because  from our point of view  competition between the stock market centres and trading systems which are not bound locationally is the best means of finding the appropriate financial market structure for the larger currency area. The greater breadth and depth of the euro market compared with the former national markets can also bring new business  of course. The euro - especially if it is enduringly stable - is likely to be particularly attractive for internationally operating demanders and suppliers of capital. The euro  however  will still first have to earn its position in the portfolio of public and private investors by competing with other currencies. In saying that  it ought to be beyond dispute that a euro which is weak inwardly in terms of its purchasing power will not be able to take a leading position externally. For that reason  too  safeguarding monetary stability is a perpetual challenge for the euro. V Policy makers must now create confidence by taking credible decisions so that the general public and the markets accept the future euro. The aim must be a smooth changeover from the national currencies to the euro. Turbulence in the financial markets due to volatile exchange rates or to institutional investors abruptly adjusting their portfolios might place a considerable strain on the euro at its inception. In Dublin  the European Council made a major contribution to planning and legal certainty for all concerned with the two regulations on the adoption of the euro. Happily  the Amsterdam summit endorsed those drafts. But it is also necessary for the markets to know in good time how the final exchange rates are fixed. That is something which is still under discussion at present. It is very much my hope that the ministers of finance and central bank governors will arrive at a common opinion on this question at the next Informal Ecofin in Luxembourg in September. The choice of the countries starting with monetary union will naturally be of crucial importance. In accordance with the schedule  that decision will be taken in spring 1998 on the basis of the economic data for 1997. In my view  speculating now about the group of participants is inappropriate. Such speculation could ultimately do more harm than good  because it increases overall uncertainty. For that reason  I shall also continue to refrain from engaging in it. In my opinion  neither political calculation nor short-term success in meeting the criteria should decide the choice of participants to be made  ultimately  by the heads of state and of government acting by a qualified majority. Rather  sustained convergence and credibility in terms of anti-inflation policy will be crucial. It will undoubtedly be possible to gauge how credible that decision is by how the financial markets behave  too. VI A stable euro will indeed be a valuable treasure. That is why the architects of monetary union must not forget that monetary stability is a perpetual challenge. And on no account must they forget that confidence in a currency is established only with difficulty  but BIS Review 64/1997 - 7 - squandered incredibly quickly. Even if the euro will not fall into the European nations’ lap like a star falling as a thaler from the sky  at least the efforts undertaken to obtain it must not be in vain. Monetary union must not be achieved by gaining the euro and losing stability. Instead  we need a euro which - like the D-Mark now - is a byword for lasting stability. BIS Review 64/1997
r970626c,1997-06-26,https://www.bis.org/review/r970626c.pdf,Mr. Greenspan examines the process by which former centrally planned economies are embracing free markets (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  10 Jun 97),Remarks by the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  Mr. Alan Greenspan  at the Woodrow Wilson Award Dinner of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in New York on 10/6/97.,Mr. Greenspan examines the process by which former centrally planned economies are embracing free markets Remarks by the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  Mr. Alan Greenspan  at the Woodrow Wilson Award Dinner of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in New York on 10/6/97. On November 9  1989  the Berlin Wall came down  symbolizing the end of an experiment in economic and social policy that began more than four decades earlier with the division of the states of Western and Central Europe into market economies and those governed by state central planning. At the end of World War II  as Winston Churchill put it  “From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain ... descended across the Continent.” Aside from the Soviet Union itself  the economies on the Soviet side of the “curtain” had been  in the prewar period  similar to the market-based economies on the western side. Over four decades both types of economies developed with limited interaction across the dividing line. It was as close to a controlled experiment in the viability of economic systems as could ever be implemented. The results  unequivocally in favor of market economies  have had far-reaching consequences. The long-standing debate between the virtues of economies organized around free markets and those governed by centrally planned socialism is essentially at an end. To be sure  there are still a few who still support the old fashioned socialism -- but for the vast majority of professed socialists it is now a highly diluted socialism  an amalgam of social equity and the efficiency of the market  often called market socialism. The verdict on rigid central planning has been rendered  and it is generally appreciated to have been unequivocally negative. Over the last seven years  with the Soviet bloc books now open  we of course have learned much about how communist economics worked  or  more to the point  did not. But the biggest surprise is what the aftermath of the four-decade experiment has been teaching us about how and why our own Western economies and societies function  or  perhaps more exactly  refreshing our own long-dormant memories of the process. Economists have had considerable experience this century in observing how market economies converted to centrally planned ones but until recently have had virtually no exposure in the opposite direction. Ironically  in aiding in the process of implementing the latter  we are being forced to more fully understand the roots of our own system. Much of what we took for granted in our free market system and assumed to be human nature was not nature at all  but culture. The dismantling of the central planning function in an economy does not  as some had supposed  automatically establish a free market entrepreneurial system. There is a vast amount of capitalist culture and infrastructure underpinning market economies that has evolved over generations: laws  conventions  behaviors  and a wide variety of business professions and practices that have no important functions in a centrally planned economy. Centrally planned economic systems  such as that which existed in the Soviet Union  had great difficulty in creating wealth and rising standards of living. In theory  and to a large extent in practice  production and distribution were determined by specific instructions -- often in the form of state orders -- coming from the central planning agencies to the various different producing establishments  indicating from whom  and in what quantities  they should receive their raw materials and services  and to whom they should distribute their final outputs. The work force was assumed to be fully employed and wages were somewhat arbitrarily predetermined. BIS Review 64/1997 - 2 - Without an effective market clearing mechanism  the consequences of such a paradigm  as one might readily anticipate  were both huge surpluses of goods which  while produced  were not wanted by the populace  and huge shortages of products that consumers desired but were not produced in adequate quantities. The imbalance of demand over supply inevitably required rationing or its equivalent  standing in queues for limited quantities of goods and services. One might think that the planning authorities should have been able to adjust to these distortions. They tried. But they faced insurmountable handicaps in that they did not have access to the immediate signals of price changes that so efficiently clear markets in capitalist economies. Just as important  they did not have the signals of finance to adjust the allocation of physical resources to accommodate the shifting tastes of consumers. In a centrally planned system  banking and finance play a decidedly minor role. Since the production and distribution of goods and services are essentially driven by state orders and rationing  finance is little more than record keeping. While there are pro-forma payment transfers among state-owned enterprises  few if any actions are driven by them. Payment arrears  or even defaults  are largely irrelevant in the sense that they are essentially transactions among enterprises owned by the same entity  that is  the state. Under central planning there are no credit standards  no interest rate risks  no market value changes  that is  none of the key financial signals that determine who gets credit  and who does not  and hence who produces what  and sells to whom  in a market economy. In short  none of the financial infrastructure which converts the changing valuations of consumers into market signals that direct production for profit are available. But it didn’t matter in the Soviet-bloc economies. Few decisions in those centrally planned systems were affected by the lack of a developed financial system. That centrally planned economies  as a consequence  were highly inefficient is best illustrated by the fact that energy consumed per unit of output was as much as five to seven times higher in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union than in the West. Moreover  the exceptionally large amount of resources devoted to capital investment  without contributing to the productive capacity of these economies  suggests that these resources were largely wasted. Regrettably  until the Berlin Wall was breached and the need to develop market economies out of the rubble of Eastern Europe’s central planning regime became apparent  little contemporary thought had been given to the institutional infrastructure required of markets. Nonetheless  in the years immediately following the fall of the Berlin Wall many of the states of the former Soviet bloc did get something akin to a market system in the form of a rapid growth of black markets that replicated some of what seemingly goes on in a market economy. But only in part. Black markets  by definition  are not supported by the rule of law. There are no rights to own and dispose of property protected by the enforcement power of the state. There are no laws of contract or bankruptcy  or judicial review and determination again enforced by the state. The essential infrastructure of a market economy is missing. Black markets offer few of the benefits of legally sanctioned trade. To know that the state will protect one’s rights to property will encourage the taking of risks that create wealth and foster growth. Few will risk their capital  however  if there is little assurance that the rewards of risk are secure from the arbitrary actions of government or street mobs. BIS Review 64/1997 - 3 - Indeed  today’s Russia is striving to rid itself of a substantial black market intertwined with its evolving market economy. Law enforcement in support of private property is uneven in its application. Private security forces  to a large extent  have taken over protection  with results sometimes less than satisfactory. The shift of vast real resources from the defunct Soviet state to private parties  whose claims in many instances are perceived as dubious  has not enhanced public support for the protection of such claims by official authorities. Some  but not all  would argue with the Russian academic who last month told the Washington Post that “The state thinks ... private capital should be defended by those who have it. ...It’s a completely conscious policy of the law enforcement authorities to remove themselves from defending private capital.” Certainly  if generations of Russians have been brought up on the Marxist notion that private property is “theft ” a breakdown of the Soviet central planning infrastructure is not going to automatically alter the perceived moral base of its social system. The right to property in market economies  on the other hand  is morally rooted in its culture. Indeed  the presumption of property ownership and the legality of its transfer must be deeply embedded in the culture of a society for free market economies to function effectively. In the West and especially under British common law and its derivatives  the moral validity of property rights is accepted  or at least acquiesced in  by virtually the whole of the population. Accordingly  a very small proportion of contracts have to be enforced through actions in the courts. Moreover  reflecting a strong commitment to property rights  a surprisingly large number of contracts  especially in financial markets  are initially oral  confirmed only at a later date  and at times after much price movement  by a written document. The differing attitudes and views toward property ownership are passed from generation to generation through family values and education systems. Hence  the process of full transition from the so-called collective rights of socialist economies to the individual property rights of market economies and legal certainties can be expected to be slow. One prominent young Russian reformer of my acquaintance thinks the transition is moving quickly among those under forty years of age  much less so among their elders. Altering what a nation teaches its children is a profoundly difficult task and clearly cannot be accomplished overnight. Changing attitudes toward property and profit is not simple. These attitudes derive from the deepest values of personal worth people hold. Aside from property rights enforced by an impartial judiciary  for a market economy to function effectively  there must also be widespread dissemination of timely financial and other relevant information. This enables market participants to make the type of informed judgments that foster the most efficient allocation of capital -- efficient in the sense that our physical resources are directed at producing those goods and services most valued by consumers. This requires a free press and government data information systems that are perceived to be free of hidden political manipulation. Government censorship in any form renders information suspect. Such information will be disregarded by market participants as virtually useless  requiring individuals to rely on rumor and other dubious sources of information. This leads to misjudgments about the changing patterns of consumer demand and hence significantly eviscerates the market’s effectiveness and its role in directing real resources to their optimum uses. BIS Review 64/1997 - 4 - Most other rights that we Americans cherish -- protection against extra-legal violence or intimidation by the state  arbitrary confiscation of property without due process  as well as freedom of speech and of the press  and an absence of discrimination -- are all essential to an effective  functioning market system. Indeed a list or bill of rights enforced by an impartial judiciary is  and I hesitate to use the analogy  what substitutes for the central planning function as the guiding mechanism of a free market economy. It is these “rights” that enable the value judgements of millions of consumers to be converted through a legally protected free market into prices of products and financial instruments; and it is  of course  these market prices that substitute for the state orders of the centrally planned economies. We depend on government in a free society to ensure those market “rights.” Perhaps of greater importance  those rights can also be viewed as a list of prohibitions delimiting the actions of government. Thus  the more effective the list is in constraining the arbitrary actions of government officials  the less it matters what they do. The tighter the proscription on government officials’ discretion  the less arbitrary government power is available to the highest bidder. The democratic process  of course  is needed to ensure that the “list of market rights” has the continued sanction of the people. Since any bill of rights specifies the limits to which government officials can infringe on the rights of individuals  the rational self-interest of the populace is always to protect and broaden individual rights. The self-interest of those officials who have the power to exert discretionary power in areas not specifically delimited by a bill of rights  is  too often  to broaden that scope. Hence  authoritarian societies  even benevolent ones  are biased to restraining the rights of individuals generally and property in particular. Clearly  not all democracies protect the private right of property with the same fervor. Indeed  they vary widely. Nor is it the case that all societies with firmly protected property rights bend invariably to the majority will of the populace on all public issues. Certainly in its earlier years Hong Kong did not have a democratic process but a “list of rights” protected by British common law and Britain’s democracy. Singapore  from a similar heritage  does protect property and contract rights  the crucial pillars of market efficiency  but does not have some of the other characteristics of western democracies with which we are familiar. There are those who argue  however  that as this remarkable city-state evolves  increasing wealth will push it toward broader freedoms. To summarize then  the ideal state of affairs for a centrally planned economy is one in which there is continuous production of the same type of goods  of the same quality  of the same design  obediently purchased in repetitive quantities  with cash wages backed as necessary by rationing coupons. Centrally planned economies are frozen in time. They cannot readily accommodate innovation  new ideas  new products  and altered specifications. In sharp contrast  capitalist market economies are driven by what Professor Joseph Schumpeter  a number of decades ago  called “creative destruction.” By this he meant newer ways of doing things  newer products  and novel engineering and architectural insights that induce the continuous obsolescence and retirement of factories and equipment and a reshuffling of workers to new and different activities. Market economies in that sense are continuously renewing themselves. Innovation  risk taking  and competition are the driving forces that propel standards of living progressively higher. BIS Review 64/1997 - 5 - Thus  the bold  if unintended  experiment in economic and social systems  which began after World War II in Europe  did not come to a full resting place with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Despite the ebb and flow of governments of differing persuasions  the face of the world economy continues to edge toward free-market-oriented societies. This is especially the case as increasing numbers of transition economies prosper and emerging market economies wedded to free-market paradigms grow impressively. There has been  to be sure  much pain and periodic backtracking among a number of the nations that discarded the mantle of central planning. There will doubtless be more. But the experience of the last half century clearly attests to how far the power of the idea of market freedom can carry. BIS Review 64/1997

The moment has come for me to say a heartfelt “thank you” to you all! I should like to express my gratitude  first of all  to the governors of the central banks of the European Union  who  in the autumn of 1993  chose me as their candidate for the presidency of the European Monetary Institute  thereby setting in train a process which has allowed me to play a part in a ground-breaking enterprise of exceptional scope and responsibility. I should like to thank them  secondly  in their capacity as members of the EMI Council  for their cooperation in this undertaking and for their wisdom  prudence  willingness to compromise but also their will to achieve results. They have invariably acted with the utmost professionalism. I should like to add that we should not have been able to achieve what has been done without the conviction - which each of us shares - that the first duty of a central bank is to maintain price stability. This fundamental principle has never been a matter of dispute. My thanks go next to the political authorities. First  to the Heads of State or of Government  who did me the honour of putting their faith in me in appointing me President of the EMI. Second  to the Finance Ministers  who resigned themselves gracefully to the existence of an institution which would be independent of the executive and who played their part  with consummate political skill  in establishing the good working atmosphere between the ECOFIN and the EMI  in the mutual respect of our respective competencies. I hope that this will be an enduring legacy. Thanks go  too  to the European Commission  with which we have been able - after a little trial and error  and with both sides demonstrating good will and a certain ability to listen - to draw up the rules of the game for the indispensable cooperation which is needed to enable the project of Economic and Monetary Union to go ahead. The European Parliament - and several national parliaments - have given me the opportunity to report on the work of the EMI  in an atmosphere of constructive dialogue. Their questions and concerns  as well as those of the media and of the large number of associations from both the banking and financial sphere as well as society at large  have given me valuable insights into the expectations and concerns of our fellow citizens. These thanks would not be complete without expressing publicly what I have already had the opportunity to say in private to the members of the management and staff of the European Monetary Institute: without their personal commitment  their spirit of innovation  their boundless ability to find the happy medium - and not just a practical compromise between the concerns of our central banks - nothing would have been accomplished. What can I say to you know by way of farewell? There is little point in giving you the “final score” at this stage - the match is not over yet ... Recommendations on how to cope with the challenges which are looming on the horizon? You will deal with them effectively  I am convinced  without my advice. But perhaps you will accept some reflections on the ability - and the limits - of monetary policy to meet the expectations of our fellow citizens who  while appreciating the confirmation (or renewal) of price stability  are looking for stronger growth and  above all  more jobs. I share their concern unreservedly. The current level of unemployment in the majority of our countries is ethically unacceptable; it is leading to the BIS Review 67/1997 - 2 - erosion of the social fabric and  because of the waste it represents  it is a clear signal that the economy is not functioning properly. Reducing unemployment must be the prime objective of action by the authorities. But what should be the role of monetary policy? In view of the short time available to me - plus the fact that you cannot contradict me - I shall be brief. You may perhaps feel that I am being dogmatic: if so  please bear with me. I should like to make four observations. 1. There is not doubt whatsoever that monetary policy can bring inflation under control. When monetary policy is not flanked by the appropriate budgetary policy  and when labour markets - but also goods and services markets - are not flexible  bringing inflation under control will take time. It will take time  and it can also entail costs - which could otherwise have been avoided. But even so  these costs would still be less than the (very high long-term) cost of not dealing with inflation. Let us not forget that while the rich and the powerful can protect themselves from any loss of purchasing power of their money - and in many cases can even benefit from such a loss - the weak and the not-so-rich will always be the losers. Inflation has always been a major source of social iniquity. In addition  it prevents the economy from functioning properly  by falsifying the signals which are given by prices. The speculative boom in the real estate markets in some of our countries at the end of the 1980s caused serious damage - and we are still paying the price. 2. Once inflation has been brought under control  and once this control has been confirmed  monetary policy can guide short-term interest rates to a level which contributes to balanced growth. Quite a number of EU countries are in such a situation already  with short-term interest rates at around 3%. In others  where inflation has been brought under control more recently  rates have not yet reached this level but are approaching it gradually. The confirmation that inflation has been brought under control does  unfortunately  take time. Finally  in one major country which has seen rapid growth for several years now and in which unemployment has fallen remarkably  short-term interest rates have been raised - applying the principle of preventive medicine. 3. Now  what can we say about long-term interest rates  which also have an important role to play in stimulating growth - perhaps an even more important one than short-term rates? Monetary policy does have an influence on the level of these rates  but its influence is not exclusive and we cannot even predict the direction of its influence with certainty. At this particular point in time  in the first group of countries to which I referred a moment ago  nominal long-term interest rates are at a historically low level - they are well below 6% - but real long-term interest rates can be regarded  perhaps  as still being too high to put continental Europe on the road to more vigorous growth. I am doubtful whether a further easing of monetary policy in this group of countries would be able to help move the yield curve in the desired direction. It could actually have the opposite effect - if investors perceived it as heralding a weak euro. In any event  given the current level of short-term interest rates  monetary policy’s margin for manoeuvre is extremely limited. It is possible that the level of real long-term interest rates in Europe reflects  partially at least  that of real interest rates worldwide. Europe has no influence over that effect. BIS Review 67/1997 - 3 - Europe can  however  have an influence on the effect which comes from the constant increase in public sector indebtedness in our countries. As a reminder  between the end of 1991 and the end of 1996 the general government debt rose from around 56 to above 73% of GDP for the European Union as a whole. This development  together with the worry that it might not yet have run its course  are not likely - to say the least - to lead to a fall in real interest rates. Nor do they create the climate of confidence necessary for consumers and investors to modify their current prudent behaviour. On the other hand  the certainty that governments are tackling the underlying causes of the public deficits which are responsible for the constant increase in the debt burden could well bring about such a change in behaviour. “Faceless” markets are not the only ones looking beyond the immediate present to the future - our fellow citizens are  too. The prospect of self-perpetuating  ever-increasing deficits will not encourage them to spend more. 4. Stronger growth would certainly have a beneficial effect on employment. But it would not eliminate the largest component of unemployment - the structural component. This can be done by means of measures which remedy labour market rigidities and reduce the burden of non-wage labour costs. It is this latter channel that links efforts to create jobs with the task of bringing public expenditure under control. I observe  too  that in those countries where unemployment has fallen substantially  jobs have been created not by existing enterprises - and especially not by large enterprises - but by the setting-up of a large number of new enterprises  which have necessarily been small to begin with. To conclude - allow me  if you will  to be quite blunt. Yes  once inflation has been brought properly under control  monetary policy can and must contribute to supporting balanced growth  but balanced growth will not depend on monetary policy alone. Both the acceleration and the viability of growth will rely on the contribution to be made by other policies. First  on that of a fiscal policy which does not crowd out private investment but  rather  fosters a climate of confidence by implementing a credible process of reforms. Second  on that of a policy which creates a favourable fiscal  financial and regulatory environment for the proliferation of new enterprises. And  so that the growth fostered in this way can create many jobs  structural policies will have to assume the principal role  while the role of monetary policy will then dwindle and fade away - alas - to nothing.

Thank you for your invitation. And  particularly  thank you for not withdrawing it when you discovered that  rather than having on your platform a benign  soft-centred Deputy Governor of the Bank of England  you found yourself face to face with the all-seeing  all-regulating head of super-SIB. This may have come as a surprise to you - but nothing like as big a surprise as it was to me  I can assure you. And I have to say that  in spite of the way I have been presented in some of the newspapers  muscles rippling beneath a Superman T-shirt  I still feel rather more like Clark Kent in his thick specs  stumbling myopically around the office. I haven’t yet found a phonebox in which to get changed. I do not plan  this morning  to talk at length about my new responsibilities  partly for the very good reason that I have not had the time to prepare a coherent plan of campaign. But I might just say a word or two about the new SIB  and the way it will affect your business. I have been quite encouraged  so far  by the market reaction to the proposed new structure. Warning notes have been sounded  of course  about the need to avoid a lumbering  slow-moving bureaucracy  and the need to ensure that regulation is appropriate for the type of market. I understand those points and  particularly as far as you are concerned  the need to distinguish between professional wholesale markets and the retail sector. There are some interesting developments in that direction in the US at present  which we shall certainly look carefully at as we decide our own new structures. But  overall  I sense that we begin the task with some goodwill in the marketplace. I was particularly interested to see the summary of the views of members of your Association on regulation in the Price Waterhouse report published late last year. That is a helpful document which we will take into account. I was struck by the importance you attached to a clear but flexible regulatory environment  which scored highly as a success factor as far as the London market was concerned. And I took the strong point made about the need for cost control  on the one hand  and to provide a framework which facilitates innovation. When it came to structure  your views were divided. But I was encouraged that the option of an enlarged SIB incorporating the SROs was the one which received the strongest favourable response. There was also quite a bit of support for taking banking supervision out of the Bank of England. Unfortunately  I cannot readily assess the level of support for the particular option which the Government have now chosen  since the researchers did not ask you to assess it - which is certainly a tribute to the new Government’s ability to surprise the market. But in these surveys I am always fascinated by the outlying views - the small minorities who express a contrary opinion. For example  when asked about the most appropriate regulatory structure 2 per cent of those asked said they thought the best option would be to abandon the SIB and the SROs  and the Bank of England  and that regulation should be carried out directly by the Treasury. I would be very grateful if that 2 per cent of you could stay behind afterwards  assuming they have not been institutionalised since the study was conducted. BIS Review 67/1997 - 2 - The strongest message to emerge  though  was the need for regulators to consult the market effectively on both structures and on rules. I am certainly prepared to undertake here and now that we shall do so. We are charged by the Government to produce an over-arching framework pretty quickly  so our discussions with the market will need to start now. But  thereafter  we will consult intensively on the way in which the new structure will affect day to day regulation. I give you my firm undertaking on that point. But  as I said  today I am not speaking to you as the Chairman of the SIB. And you have asked me  particularly  as Deputy Governor of the Bank to talk about Economic and Monetary Union  and the way it will impact on your business. Let us  therefore  move quickly on to that point. Whenever I have accepted an invitation to speak about EMU over the last couple of years  I have done so with the hope that when the day came to speak  the clouds of uncertainty surrounding the project would have cleared - both in terms of developments among the countries committed to going ahead  and in terms of the UK’s position. But my hopes have so far been confounded  and indeed the events of the last couple of weeks have complicated matters even further. This is not the time or place to talk in detail about the Bundesbank’s little local difficulty with Herr Waigel. And it is too early to assess the consequences for the project of the results of the French election. But it is clear that new elements of uncertainty have entered the scene  making it harder than ever to forecast the outcome next year. Looking at the markets’ own assessment  our interpretation of movements in the forward FX markets since the autumn is that the markets have become more persuaded that the euro will begin  but that it will be a broader  and possibly weaker euro. Until last summer the assumption appeared to be that only seven or eight countries would make up the hard core. In the last few months the expected future correlation of the deutsche mark/dollar and lira/dollar rates has strengthened  suggesting a stronger market expectation of those currencies being part of the first wave. Very recently  a few doubts seem to have emerged about the project itself  though it would seem that  according to the market  the most likely outcome remains that a euro of some sort would start on time. I recognise that this is a difficult background against which businesses need to plan. Our own advice  which we have maintained for some time now  is that it is prudent to plan on the basis that the euro will begin on 1 January 1999  as set out in the Treaty. As far as the position of the UK is concerned  the option remains open  the policy remains what the French call ‘le wait and see’. But the new Chancellor  like the old  has acknowledged that there are considerable difficulties to overcome if the UK is to be a first wave member. This is not a tidy position to be in  perhaps  but against the uncertain background  it nonetheless has a certain practical appeal. But taking my prudent assumption - that EMU will go ahead - what can we say about the impact on the London market in general  and on the futures and options business in particular? I note with interest that your own assessment is that the best option for the futures and options business in London would be for EMU to go ahead and for the UK to participate in the first wave. It is a moot point as to whether the impact on the profits and bonuses of derivatives traders will be the number one criterion in the minds of Labour MPs when they come to reach a view on EMU  but I will certainly draw it to their attention if you would like me to do so. BIS Review 67/1997 - 3 - By contrast  you are slightly  though not exaggeratedly pessimistic about business opportunities in London if EMU goes ahead with the UK a ‘slow track’ country. I regard this as a pessimistic assessment  and will attempt this morning to persuade you that you are wrong. My first point  and perhaps the strongest  is that uncertainty about UK participation in EMU has persisted now for a considerable number of years - perhaps indeed since the late 1970s when the UK government’s response to the original EMU plan was distinctly lukewarm. And certainly no British Prime Minister has given an enthusiastic endorsement of the most recent Delors Plan for EMU  at any stage. Yet at the same time  London has remained the dominant futures and options market in Europe  and indeed it has strengthened its position in many markets during that time so that  as far as on-exchange business is concerned  London is by far the largest centre in Europe and second only to Chicago. And the central bank survey of OTC derivatives markets in 1995 demonstrated London’s position as the premier centre for the trading and booking of OTC derivatives with 27 per cent of average daily turnover  pushing New York into second place. I do not propose to follow the traditional gambit of Ministerial speakers at trade conferences  reciting figures far better known to the audience than to the speaker  but the growth of LIFFE  the LME  the IPE and OMLX in recent years has been striking  and the most recent development is that LIFFE overtook the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to become the world’s second largest exchange in the first quarter of this year. So if  as I was taught at Stanford Business School  markets are efficient in the sense that they react in advance of events  in the light of an assessment of probabilities  then they appear not to have been particularly distressed by the prospect that EMU may start without the UK in the first wave. Certainly we have not seen an anticipatory flow of business away from London and towards Continental European markets. We have recently asked ourselves why it is that LIFFE has retained its position in the three-month euromark contract and the ten-year Bund contract - Europe’s most active longer-term interest rate contract. And for those of you who like to go home with a reading list  there is an interesting article on the subject of what makes for successful futures contacts in our latest Quarterly Bulletin. (I am sure the restaurants and the bars of the West End will be empty tonight as you sit in your hotel rooms poring over it.) Frankfurt has recently started making inroads into LIFFE’s share of Bund futures business - but the level of activity on LIFFE nonetheless continues to increase. Our assessment is that  in these markets  there is a considerable and long-term advantage inherent in being the first mover. That helped LIFFE to achieve a very broad and international membership  with only 27 per cent of members being UK-based. It has meant that London has an established skill base and good support functions in law and accountancy. Also a good telecommunications system - though fewer of those old telephone boxes  which may be a problem for me at super-SIB. London also has a strong clearing function and we should not forget the advantage of the English language  which is increasingly the lingua franca of the European Union  and I believe that even some Americans can now speak a kind of pidgin version which allows them to be understood. But EMU will create change. This raises three interesting questions. What will be traded in an EMU environment? How much will be traded? And where will the new instruments be traded? Let me take these points in turn. What will be traded when the euro makes its debut? BIS Review 67/1997 - 4 - Looking first at on-exchange markets  it seems likely that  in EMU  there will be room for only one three-month euro short-term interest rate futures contract  although the greater depth of the new euro market may allow other products at the short end of the yield curve  such as a one-month euro contract  to co-exist with the three-month benchmark product. In the bond markets  one - and perhaps the most likely outcome - is that a particular government’s bonds will become the benchmark for the new euro bond market. We may all speculate idly on which that country might be. These issues would then anchor the euro yield curve and futures contracts would follow naturally. The greater depth of the new euro bond market may well mean that it can support a greater range of futures contracts further along its yield curve  as is the case now in the US. Five and two-year contracts  which do already exist in the Bund market  may develop further. The exchanges themselves recognise this point and are seeking to fill in the yield curve in their various markets before the start of EMU. Other national bond markets will be keen to run alongside the main market and futures contracts on those markets may also exist. But their number will depend on the basket of deliverables of the futures contracts and how those baskets are defined. The alternative would be for a group of different countries’ bonds to be traded interchangeably  but that seems an unlikely outcome. On the OTC markets  the last 18 months has seen the proliferation of trades based on changing perceptions of the likelihood of convergence for the traditionally high-yielding countries and trades based on the differential yields of French and German government bonds. If I might embark on a regulatory diversion here  just for one moment  we at the Bank expect those banks involved in convergence trading to undertake rigorous stress testing of their portfolios to assess the market risk they are running on open positions. That testing should also shed light on the potential for changes in their credit risk - for example if an OTC contract is moving further in the money due to a market movement  the bank would become more exposed to its counter-party. We believe that the credit exposure implications of stress testing should be taken seriously too and are encouraging banks as best practice to do that. In our view not enough institutions do so yet. After EMU  one would expect to see the elimination of exchange rate risk narrowing yield differentials in the bond markets. With exchange rate risk removed and a single monetary policy in operation  national bond yields will differ principally because of differential default risks and differences in market liquidity. That should leave default risk more readily monitorable and more efficiently priced. We should therefore see an enhancement of banks’ and investment houses’ credit analysis functions and more trading of credit differentials. My second question was how much will be traded in a post-EMU world? This is not an easy question to answer. Volumes are difficult to predict. On the one hand  EMU may bring about a more stable interest rate environment  as well as eliminating national interest rates and exchange rates  reducing the need for hedging mediums and hence for derivative products. On the other hand  increased liquidity in the euro bond markets could encourage business and we could well see new participants entering the capital and derivative markets. My hunch is that the latter possibility is more likely. And that the market for carefully constructed derivatives contracts  properly sold to customers with a genuine need for them  will continue to expand. BIS Review 67/1997 - 5 - That brings me to my third question  where will the trading be done? I do not think that there is a determinist answer to this question. Nor  certainly  should it be a matter of decision by politicians  central bankers or financial regulators. Certainly  our predisposition is to think that competition will and should determine where business is done and the outcome will depend on the imagination and effort of the managers and controllers of the different markets. There will be lively competition between LIFFE  the DTB and Matif  I am quite sure. And LIFFE do not need me to argue their case for them. I see from the programme that they are sponsoring the coffee and the tea at this conference. As a regulator it will of course be quite impossible for me to accept such lavish and unreasonable hospitality  but the rest of you are welcome to do so. For the moment  LIFFE has a dominant position in short-term interest rate futures and is the leading contender to capitalise on that position  whether or not the UK elects to join EMU in the first wave. It has already amended its contract specifications and from March 1999 onwards these contracts will settle against the three-month interest rate for euros  a move which has been widely welcomed in the industry. The new euro bond market is likely to support a range of futures contracts  as I have said  and it is not impossible that more than one identical contract will continue to exist post-EMU  due to arbitrage opportunities  as happens now between the LIFFE’s and the DTB’s Bund contract. That will be an interesting competitive arena to watch. As far as OTC derivatives are concerned  there is little reason why London should lose its pre-eminent position as a result of EMU. OTC markets by definition have no centralised trading platform and their location will depend on  for example  the regulatory environment  the availability of staff of sufficient quality and in sufficient numbers and the other success factors I described earlier. It is also worth noting that other changes are under way in the markets as well as EMU. The most notable is the advances in technology which have enabled electronic trading to start to challenge traditional open outcry. In response  open outcry exchanges are looking to automate and streamline their trading through technology to reduce costs. And it would seem that the exchange-traded futures industry is coming under some pressure from the OTC derivatives market  which appears to be expanding at a more rapid pace. All of these changes will run in parallel with the introduction of the euro  and as far as competition is concerned  success in those areas may well dominate the euro factor. But I said earlier that the outcome of these competitive skirmishes cannot be simply determined in advance by an analysis of existing competitive advantages. It will depend on the efforts of the different players and on the extent to which they are well prepared in advance. Here I found your own survey rather depressing. The assessment was that relatively few market participants in London had made serious preparations for EMU  and seemed unsure of how to proceed. Only 6 per cent of brokers and own account traders had made contingency plans for the introduction of EMU. But this survey was undertaken in April of last year  and I am confident that the responses would be different today. Certainly  a lot of work has been done in the London market  co-ordinated and steered by a team in the Bank  to ensure that London is as well prepared as other European BIS Review 67/1997 - 6 - centres for EMU. And our assessment now  which I believe is shared by the EMI and the Commission  is that London is as well prepared as most if not all European centres. I can assure you that the Bank of England itself will be ready for EMU on 1 January 1999  whether or not the UK is a member. We will be able to offer euro accounts and euro settlement facilities. We have taken the lead in work on market conventions across Europe. EMU is likely to bring harmonisation of conventions such as day count and frequency of coupon payments among Europe’s bond markets  and the London market is ready to do that. We have been in regular discussion with ISDA which is taking a leading role in co-ordinating preparations of those involved with swaps and other OTC derivatives. And a recent working group chaired by the Bank has examined the adaptations that may be needed in the gilt market  covering re-denomination of gilts into euro  whether to quote in decimals or fractions  the frequency of coupon payments  etc. There seems a reasonable chance that the dramatic move to abandon 30 seconds as the basis for gilt pricing may come about before too long. This could be the only unambiguously  incontestably good thing to come out of Economic and Monetary Union. We have also conducted some really exciting discussions on the issue of rounding - a subject which I find can cause great excitement among accountants and lawyers. And anything which brings excitement to their sad lives should clearly be welcomed by us all. My general conclusion - and I will end here  you will be pleased to know - is that while EMU will significantly affect your markets  it does not negate the usual rules of competition and success. EMU changes the raw material which you work with to generate your exotic  and sometimes dangerous products. But it does not change the rules of economics  nor does it alter the dynamics of competition. It closes down some aspects of current financial market business  but opens up a big set of new opportunities at the same time. Those who seize those opportunities will be the most innovative  most cost effective  and most fast moving. At the moment  on this side of the Atlantic  most of those people are found in London. I see no reason why they should move. BIS Review 67/1997

I should like to begin with a word of thanks for the invitation to talk to you here. In these introductory remarks I shall be discussing the economic situation. Sweden’s economy presents many positive aspects: the outlook for growth is good  the general government deficit is estimated to be eliminated next year and the low inflation policy is becoming more and more established. But there are also persistent economic problems to solve  not least in the labour market. Before considering the economic situation  however  I thought I would say something about monetary policy  the role of the Riksbank and the changes in the status of the Riksbank that recently gained the support of five of the political parties in Sweden’s parliament  including the Centre Party. 1. Monetary policy and the role of the Riksbank Why low inflation? In the past decade there has been a growing awareness of low inflation’s importance as a central condition for the proper workings of an economy. This has been the case not just in Sweden but virtually throughout the western world. The significance of price stability is clearly demonstrated by Sweden’s experience in earlier decades. The economic climate in the 1950s and 1960s  with low inflation  high and stable growth and low unemployment makes a sharp contrast with the 1970s and 1980s  when attempts to keep the price rise on a par with the rest of the world failed and a series of devaluations had negative effects on wage formation  productivity and economic growth. There is reason to believe that the high and fluctuating inflation in the 1970s and 1980s contributed to the weak state of investment and productivity. The recurrent crises over wage costs generated uncertainty about business profits and thereby about the conditions for investment. And although the devaluations did lead to a temporary improvement of profitability in the sector exposed to foreign competition  they also eased the pressure for structural adjustments. By concealing important economic signals  high and fluctuating inflation impairs the workings of the economy. Households and firms are less able to make rational consumption and investment decisions and planning for the longer term is more difficult. The risks are greater and the required return  including compensation for the risks  rises. Decision-making therefore becomes more short term and speculative. A good example is Sweden’s real estate boom in the 1980s. The combination of high inflation and the tax system at that time meant that speculative capital was attracted to the property market. Financing more productive investment became comparatively difficult. When inflation fell back in the early 1990s it became apparent that the investments in real estate had been founded on unrealistic expectations that prices would continue to rise. The property market collapsed and credit institutions were hit by massive loan losses. The bank crisis accordingly accentuated the economic downturn in Sweden. BIS Review 68/1997 - 2 - Inflation is also associated with an arbitrary redistribution of income and wealth  often contrary to the ambitions of distribution policy. Referring again to the 1980s  the chief losers from the inflationary economy at that time  with the resultant price fall  were probably not the property speculators but households whose bank savings were eroded by two-digit inflation and whose wages were only subsequently adjusted for inflation. Price stability is the Riksbank’s objective The reason why monetary policy is assigned the task of safeguarding the value of money is basically simple: by adopting an appropriate monetary stance the central bank can choose  or at least strongly influence  the rate of inflation. In the short run price increases are of course affected by many other factors such as the state of economic activity  the direction of fiscal policy  wage formation  etc. But in the long run inflation is a monetary phenomenon. By controlling the supply of money in a wide sense  in the long term the Riksbank can also govern movements in the value of money and in inflation. Interest rate management by the Riksbank cannot  on the other hand  generate economic growth and employment in the longer run. The crucial factors for this are quite different  such as capital formation  demographic trends  advances in technology and education  how the economy functions  etc. Some scope for stimulating the economy may exist in the short run but this presupposes an established confidence in economic policy’s commitment to price stability. If economic agents have doubts about economic policy  attempts to stimulate demand will be liable to elicit an upward shift in the rate of inflation that is expected by firms  households  trade unions and others. Wages and prices may then start to chase each other as they did in the 1970s and 1980s. The longer market rates of interest  which the Riksbank can influence only marginally  will begin to move up and the ultimate effect on demand may be the opposite of what was intended. The outcome may be a combination of low growth and high inflation. Much accordingly depends on the confidence that the price stability policy enjoys. In an economy where a low inflation policy is firmly established  it is easier to lower the interest rate without eliciting uncertainty about monetary policy’s long-term commitment. There is  quite simply  more room to manoeuvre. But this does of course presuppose that the outlook for future inflation condones such a policy. Independence and accountability The institutional framework for monetary policy is important for underpinning confidence in long-term economic policy. The agreement announced recently between five political parties concerning measures to strengthen the formal status of the Riksbank is therefore a good thing  even though it amounts in many respects to a codification of current practice. It is a clear demonstration that the political system supports a monetary policy that focuses on price stability consistently and over the long term. Increased confidence in the low inflation policy among economic agents implies greater opportunities of supporting economic activity in practice when the conditions for inflation so permit. Some voices in the public debate have chosen to see this as a move towards a monetary policy that is less democratic. Such an interpretation is comprehensible but no less misleading for that. It is the Riksdag  Sweden’s parliament  that lays down monetary policy’s objective and elects the governing board  which then appoints the members of the directorate for a term of six years. The proposed changes mean that the practical execution of the monetary BIS Review 68/1997 - 3 - policy objective as established by the Riksdag is entrusted to the Riksbank. We can concentrate on this task and build up the competence that is needed to do the job properly. At the same time there is less risk of monetary policy being influenced by various short-term considerations. One way of describing the consequences of the reform is to say that the delegation improves the conditions for attaining the objective of low inflation that the Riksdag has ordained. At the same time  an independent status for the Riksbank calls for more in the way of accountability. It will be even more important that monetary policy decisions are anchored - at the political level as well as among a broader public - by means of clear motivation and an open dialogue. Decisions to adjust the interest rate tend to affect both households and firms very directly and specifically. It is therefore vital to gain an understanding for our execution of monetary policy. In recent years the Riksbank has done a great deal to promote an increased understanding of what we do. This work must continue. One instance of transparency is the clear focus on the 2 per cent inflation target. In that this target and our tolerance interval of 1 percentage point are clearly specified  the Riksbank’s operations are open to assessment. Our policy involves adjusting the instrumental interest rate - the repo rate - to a level that we judge to be in accordance with the inflation target. Experience tells us that a change in the short interest rate has its full impact on inflation after a time lag of one to two years. Consequently  the Riksbank has to operate in a relatively long time perspective - the interest rate has to be set in the light of forecasts of what the rate of inflation will be one to two years ahead. Our assessments of future inflation are presented continuously in speeches and various publications  above all the quarterly inflation reports. What I now have to say about the economic situation in Sweden is largely taken from the latest inflation report  which was published about a fortnight ago. 2. The economic situation Activity is strengthening In the period since 1993  when economic activity in Sweden turned upwards after the profound crisis  growth in annual terms has averaged 2.7 per cent  which is higher than we were accustomed to in the inflationary period in the 1970s and 1980s. The growth has also had a favourable composition  coming primarily from exports and investment. This has contributed to a period of expansion without any appreciable capacity shortages. The good export performance has also led to sizable current account surpluses  making it possible to repay foreign debt. Private consumption has been restrained by the measures taken to consolidate government finance. This consolidation will continue on a substantial scale in the years ahead but its effects have probably peaked. Together with a pent-up consumer demand  this leads us to count on rising private consumption  though the labour market situation is a factor that we believe will tend to make the increase relatively cautious. GDP growth in 1996 was held back by destocking and a continued fall in public consumption and investment. We envisage that the stock adjustments are now coming to an end. Together with some increase in consumption and a continuation of strong exports  this means that the outlook for growth in the coming years is relatively bright. Our assessment is that growth in 1997 will amount to approximately 2 per cent  followed by 3 per cent in 1998. BIS Review 68/1997 - 4 - Inflation in line with the target The path of inflation largely depends on growth in relation to the economy’s long-term potential output - in other words on how the gap between actual and potential output changes - as well as on the inflation expectations of different economic agents. The Riksbank considers that 5 per cent growth in the coming years is compatible with low inflation  mainly because in general the economy has plenty of unutilised capacity. In other words the output gap  which is affected by  for example  the labour market situation  is not expected to close in the coming years. Structural changes and increased competition in several fields suggest that the Swedish economy’s inflation propensity has fallen. Deregulation has been carried out in transport and communications  for instance  and to some extent in the food sector. EU membership has had positive effects for competition in Sweden  partly via increased competition from imports. The new competition laws have also helped to strengthen competition. Changes of this type  as everyone knows  are positive in that they pave the way for lower consumer prices. Another consequence that is less evident and therefore worth underscoring is that  in so far as the changes affect the outlook for inflation  they can provide room for a somewhat less tight monetary stance. The continued fall in inflation expectations  to a level that for Sweden is historically low  likewise suggests that inflationary pressure is subdued. Agents in markets for labour  goods and money now count on inflation being in line with the Riksbank’s inflation target in both the short and the medium term. Increased confidence in the inflation target can of itself lower the inflation propensity. The rate of wage increases to date this year indicates that the parties in the labour market are beginning to act in line with the lower expectations; the new wage settlements that have been concluded in 1997 show a downward shift in the rate of wage increases compared with 1996  towards levels that are more in line than before with the Riksbank’s inflation target. The Riksbank’s overall assessment is that in the coming two years the underlying rate of inflation will be between 1.5 and 2 per cent. Registered inflation  however  will rise by degrees with the disappearance of transitory effects that have pushed the CPI down in recent months. The registered rate will probably remain below the inflation target during 1997 and then move up towards two per cent in 1998. Against this background  in the inflation report the Riksbank considered that the monetary stance is well balanced. Forecasting inflation a couple of years ahead is  as everyone appreciates  a very difficult matter. So there is good cause to be humble. In the inflation report we have highlighted a number of factors that may cause inflation to follow a different path. A weaker exchange rate than we assume or a stronger increase in consumption could result in higher inflation. The opposite effect could come from  for example  better productivity growth or a different picture of resource utilisation. For the Riksbank it is therefore important continuously to assess new information that may provide guidance about the path of inflation. 3. Two questions The picture of Sweden’s economy I have painted thus far is relatively bright. This is warranted. The economy has gone through a deep recession after the policy realignment in the BIS Review 68/1997 - 5 - early 1990s. Difficult adjustments have been made and we are now beginning to see the results. There are many resemblances with Denmark and other countries that have experienced similar processes of adjustment earlier. In every case it has taken time for the situation to become more stable and for households and firms to recover confidence. However  the bright picture must not blind us to the continued presence of serious challenges for economic policy. For one thing there is the importance of securing sound government finance in the long run. For another there is the situation in the labour market. I choose to raise these two questions because what happens with fiscal policy and in the labour market is of great consequence for the Riksbank’s ability to safeguard the value of money. It would therefore be almost a dereliction of duty not to place these matters on the agenda as clearly and distinctly as we are able. Fiscal policy and monetary policy’s manoeuvrability Let me begin with fiscal policy. Since the dramatic deterioration of government finance in the early 1990s there has been a remarkable recovery. From a deficit equivalent to over 12 per cent of GDP in 1993 the Government now counts on a deficit of 2 per cent for 1997. This consolidation  besides attracting praise from the European Union and international organisations  has earned the confidence of our creditors; since 1995 the interest rate differential between Swedish and German treasury bonds has narrowed from 3.5 to little more than 1 percentage point. Even with the SEK 16 billion for expansionary measures in fiscal 1998 that the Government proposed in the Spring Economic Bill  the Swedish budget trend looks favourable in a European context. Notwithstanding these successes  there is reason to comment briefly on how fiscal policy influences the conditions for monetary policy and thereby the future development of interest rates. This influence acts in two ways. Firstly  fiscal policy is an important consideration for monetary policy in that it affects the demand situation in the economy. An illustration of this is provided  for example  by the recent years’ changes in household disposable income. Although household wage income rose strongly from 1994 to 1997  the sector’s disposable income hardly changed. Household income has been held back by increased taxes and decreased transfers; but for the negative effects of changes in public systems  the annual level of household income would have been 3 to 4 per cent higher. The burden on household income was probably greatest in 1996 but even in the coming two years the fiscal stance measured in this way will be tight. It is accordingly helping to lower inflationary pressure. If  in the current situation with good prospects for growth  unexpected budget improvements were to be used to give fiscal policy a more expansionary turn  the result might be an earlier need to tighten monetary policy in order to secure the objective of price stability. It is then by no means certain that the overall effect on demand would be what was intended. Secondly  the fiscal trend in a longer context of “sustainability” is also important for monetary policy. If the government deficit appears to be growing uncontrollably  as was the case for some years in the early 1990s  uncertainty may arise as to whether the problems can be tackled at all. This can have negative consequences for monetary policy; the exchange rate may weaken sharply  for instance  with an increased risk of inflation. The budget consolidation has BIS Review 68/1997 - 6 - naturally been important in this respect  too. It is the main single explanation for the krona’s appreciation since the crisis years  as well as for the Riksbank being in a position to lower interest rates so markedly. As a result of the years with massive general government deficits  however  from 1990 to 1996 public sector debt has grown from 44 per cent of GDP to 78 per cent. This restricts the future freedom of action in economic policy and means that there is a risk of fiscal policy in practice having a destabilising effect. This is particularly the case in that  with high revenue and spending ratios  the Swedish budget is sensitive to cyclical factors. Seen from this angle the Government’s target of a 2 per cent budget surplus over the economic cycle appears reasonable  though there is no academic foundation for a quantified level of ambition. There may be grounds for strategic tax cuts to improve the long-term growth potential. But in the light of the experience with government finance in recent decades a warning should be issued against tax cuts without parallel cuts in spending. Weak employment The labour market trends in recent years have been bleak. Although annual economic growth since 1993 has averaged 2.7 per cent  employment has not risen. This indicates that a considerable proportion of unemployment is structural in the sense that the level is liable to remain high even if activity continues to improve. The difficulty in generating new jobs is not confined to Sweden; it is a problem we have in common with much of Europe. But there are countries in Europe that have succeeded in turning the employment curve upwards since the mid 1980s. I am thinking in particular of the Netherlands  where employment  after a long period of stagnation  has been increased by 20 to 25 per cent since the mid 1980s. In the course of a decade unemployment has been virtually halved  from 12 to just over 6 per cent. Of course one cannot be certain that other countries’ solutions apply to Swedish conditions in every respect. But it is important to note that GDP growth in the Netherlands has been fairly close to the EU average even though employment has developed very differently. So it is not higher demand in the past decade that lies behind the creation of so many new jobs in the Netherlands. Most of the evidence suggests that traditional demand management is not capable of lowering unemployment appreciably. Instead it is the workings of the labour market and wage formation that are key factors for the possibility of turning the path of unemployment. That is where the efforts must be made. Such efforts might make it possible to combine low inflation with a better development of employment. They could then contribute to increased confidence in economic policy as a whole. At times there seems to be a tendency for the problem of unemployment to generate some uncertainty about economic policy’s long-term commitment. Reforms in the fields of wage formation and the labour market can mitigate the potential conflicts between economic policy’s goals. That would improve the conditions for a continued fall in the level of interest rates relative to the rest of the world  even in a situation where Sweden stays outside the euro area for the time being. BIS Review 68/1997 4. Summary - 7 - Today  future prospects for the Swedish economy are bright in many respects. The consolidation of the government budget  accompanied by growing confidence in and support for the low inflation policy  has paved the way for a marked reduction of interest rates. This favours domestic demand. Together with a continuation of strong exports and favourable productivity  this points to good conditions for growth in the coming years  with persistently low inflation. At the same time it is a major problem that growth does not seem to be generating new jobs to a sufficient extent. This suggests that to a high degree the unemployment is structural. Measures must therefore be taken to improve the functioning of the labour market. For further favourable economic development it is also essential that the efforts to reduce government debt are continued. The conditions for monetary policy in the years ahead will then be improved and greater freedom of action will be created for economic policy in the longer term. BIS Review 68/1997

Phillips  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the Exchequer Club in Washington on 18/6/97. It is a pleasure to be here today at the Exchequer Club. I thank you for the opportunity to discuss the changing financial landscape and offer my own perspectives on what the future might bring. During the next few months  there will be significant debates on various aspects of financial modernization  both within and without the halls of Congress. These debates may well set the stage for how financial service companies will operate as we enter the twenty- first century. As we can all plainly see  the world is changing across many dimensions  posing new and ever-increasing challenges for both financial services firms and their supervisors. To succeed in this new world  I believe it is important for the industry and supervisors to find common ground for coping with these challenges. By working together to find solutions  we can both accomplish our goals  while retaining the core principles and values that have contributed to the industry’s success. So today I would like to discuss briefly the changes underway affecting the financial services industry  as well as the individual and collective responses by the industry and supervisors to those changes. Then lastly  I will offer some thoughts on what the role of an umbrella supervisor might look like in this changing environment for financial services. All of these changes must be considered in the context of possible legislative reform. The Changing World As widely noted  dramatic advances in information and telecommunication technologies have allowed banks to develop new and more customized products and services and deliver them over a broader geographic area with greater efficiency. Such innovations by the banking industry  and by financial markets in general  have increased the sophistication and complexity of bank lending  investing  trading  and funding. They have propelled growth in less traditional or newer banking activities such as investment banking  mutual fund management  insurance and securitization. In the process  the risk profiles of many banking organizations have been altered in fundamental ways  placing greater pressure on management to monitor and manage underlying risks. To meet this challenge  a growing number of institutions are employing modern financial theory for measuring and analyzing the trade-off between risk and returns. The availability of dramatically more powerful computers at ever more affordable prices has allowed institutions to process vast data bases of rates  prices  defaults  and recoveries. As a result  techniques for portfolio management and risk measurement that not long ago were possible only in theory are now becoming integral parts of daily operating practice. By applying these theories and techniques  institutions today are more effectively pricing and hedging risk  allocating capital  evaluating risk-adjusted returns and identifying the optimum mix of financial products or services. I believe these enhanced management practices have contributed importantly to the economic growth and market gains seen in recent years. As competition has intensified  we have seen a growing overlap in the activities and product lines provided by both banks and other financial service providers that has diminished the past distinction between banks and many nonbank firms. That trend has raised BIS Review 68/1997 - 2 - public policy questions regarding bank powers and the appropriate organizational structure through which banking organizations should gain new powers. Proposals recently introduced in Congress to address those issues would fundamentally redefine the relationship of banks to other financial services companies and in some instances their relationship to commercial firms as well. Banks have not only expanded their products and activities  but have also expanded their geographic reach  both domestically and globally. Within the United States  banks have expanded nationwide as barriers to interstate banking have been removed. This expansion should continue as banks exercise their new power to branch across state lines. A related domestic trend is the rapid consolidation within and between banking organizations. Although some consolidation is undoubtedly related to the removal of barriers to interstate branching  it is also spurred by improved technology  strong competition in banking markets  and the drive by banks to reduce costs. Internationally  the globalization of banking has accelerated  driven by improved technology and the opening of economies in eastern Europe  Asia  Latin America  and other regions. In particular  U.S. and other international financial institutions are forging a growing presence in lending  trading  and underwriting in these emerging markets. These efforts have created closer links among the world’s financial markets and have improved the efficiency and availability of capital. However  market integration has also increased the potential for systemic problems to transcend national borders  as the volume of international financial transactions has grown. Last year  for example  an estimated $1.5 trillion of foreign exchange contracts were settled daily in New York City alone. A default by a major U.S. or foreign participant in that market could disrupt financial markets worldwide. Competitive pressures are intense to reduce the cost of financial services to the public. This is occurring against the need to improve the financial strength and competitiveness of the banking industry from the levels at the beginning of this decade. These factors have  in turn  also placed pressure on the banking agencies to remove unnecessary burdens on the industry without threatening safety and soundness. Regulatory and Supervisory Responses to Change What have been the regulatory and supervisory responses to these changes? Let me first discuss how we addressed the issue of regulatory burden. Although the poor bank profitability of the 1980s and early 1990s was mostly related to industry asset quality problems  regulators and Congress alike recognized that improvements could be made in bank regulations and in supervisory processes to improve credit availability and bank competitiveness without sacrificing safety and soundness. Both legislative and regulatory efforts undertaken in the decade of the 1990’s have simplified regulatory reporting requirements  expedited the application process  eliminated duplicate regulatory filings  and have led to more streamlined and uniform banking agency guidelines and regulations. Taken individually  these and other refinements may not appear material  but taken as a whole they have put a meaningful dent in regulatory costs. In fact  the industry on several occasions has reminded us that it is not necessarily any particular individual regulatory requirement that is problematic  but rather  their cumulative effect  much like the straw that broke the camel’s back. We have taken that point to heart when considering new guidelines and regulations. BIS Review 68/1997 - 3 - Efforts to reduce regulatory burden apply not only to banks  but to holding companies as well. Earlier this year  for example  the Board streamlined Regulation Y and reduced application requirements. These changes recognize that regulatory burden arises not only from the direct operational costs of compliance  but also from the indirect costs of delayed or lost opportunities to enter new activities. To reduce impediments  the Board has decided that the application process should focus on the analysis of the effects of a specific proposal  and should not generally become a vehicle for comprehensively evaluating and addressing supervisory and compliance issues. Rather  the latter can more effectively be addressed in the supervisory process. The Board also recently completed a lengthy review of its policies and procedures for assessing the competitive implications of bank mergers and acquisitions. Modifications have been made to that process to make it more efficient and address the potential benefits of scale economies for small bank mergers. Another improvement in our regulations is the ability of well-capitalized  well- run companies to apply to acquire banks and nonbanks in a faster more streamlined fashion and to commence nonbanking activities approved by regulation without obtaining prior approval. To allow bank holding companies greater opportunities to innovate  the Board has also indicated that it will be pro-active in approving new activities. Further efforts to provide flexibility and help modernize bank holding company regulations have been directed toward securities firms known as section 20 affiliates. Last year the Board raised the Section 20 ineligible revenue limit on underwriting and dealing in securities from 10 to 25 percent. This appears to be allowing greater flexibility for these operations. The Board has also eliminated certain firewalls between banks and their securities affiliates and for other firewalls has proposed to eliminate or scale back even more  recognizing that other laws  regulations  and improved disclosures provide adequate protections against conflicts of interest. These and other refinements should allow holding companies to move closer toward their goal of operating as a one-stop financial service firm for customers  while operating safely and soundly. The Comptroller of the Currency has also taken steps to widen the breadth of activities undertaken by banking organizations. For example  the expansion of insurance sales activities has opened new opportunities for national banks. Beyond efforts to reduce burden and modernize banking powers  regulators are also redesigning their supervisory practices to address more effectively the changing nature of the industry. These efforts are leading to a more risk-focused approach to supervision. That approach is more responsive to the industry’s rapidly evolving activities and risk profiles and places emphasis on the institution’s own ongoing system for managing risk  rather than point-in- time transaction testing. By focusing resources on the areas of highest risk  and eliminating unnecessary procedures  this approach is not only more effective  but also less intrusive and costly to all parties. I should note  however  that successfully implementing this approach requires that supervisors attract  train  and retain qualified staff while also upgrading training  automation  and other resources. This is a continuing challenge indeed! Regulators are also trying to build on private sector initiatives that promote safety  soundness and systemic stability. For example  at the height of Congressional concern BIS Review 68/1997 - 4 - about financial derivatives  the Group of Thirty sponsored a study to identify principles of sound practice for managing risks in derivatives for both dealers and end-users. By providing guidance on this issue  that study served as a catalyst for industry participants to analyze and evaluate their own practices. Subsequent guidance from the Federal Reserve and the Comptroller benefited from the insights provided by the study  while adding a supervisor’s perspective. The study’s emphasis on education and sound practices spurred greater understanding and acceptance by the industry of supervisory recommendations for sound risk management systems. I think it is safe to say that this cooperative approach between the private sector and regulators resulted in stronger industry practices and better supervisory oversight  not only for derivatives  but also for bank risk management more generally. Together  the industry and agency response helped stave off potentially restrictive legislation. Another example of how supervisors are trying to build on bank management practices is their use of internal value-at-risk models in the calculation of capital requirements for market risk. By relying on internal models already used by the institutions for their trading and risk management activities  regulators can reduce burden while vastly improving the accuracy of the capital calculation. In addition  by embracing internal models for regulatory purposes  supervisors are encouraging organizations to incorporate sophisticated risk models more fully and formally into their risk management systems and to continue to upgrade and improve the models. As these two examples illustrate  supervisors recognize that they do not have all the answers and that rigid regulatory solutions may often do more harm than good. A supervisory approach that promotes continued improvements in private sector practices provides the right incentives to industry and  in the case of banking  also reduces risks to the federal safety net. In these ways  supervisors are placing greater reliance on a bank’s own risk management system as the first line of defense for ensuring safety and soundness. We also want to rely more on market discipline as another line of defense. This requires increased  improved disclosure of a bank’s activities  risk exposures  and philosophy for managing and controlling risk. We have made significant gains for derivatives and market risks. Hopefully we will see further gains in other areas in the years ahead. While it is important for supervisors to identify risk at individual banks  as the central bank the Federal Reserve must also be watchful for conditions and trends external to the banking system that could place the financial system and the economy at risk. This broader perspective has become especially important with the globalization of banking and integration of markets. That is why the Federal Reserve has worked closely with financial regulators around the world to reduce systemic risk and promote sound banking practices and improved disclosures among both developed and emerging countries. These efforts have led to the advancement by the BIS of core principles of bank supervision for authorities world-wide and  significantly  promotion of consolidated supervision of banking organizations by home country authorities. The issue of consolidated supervision is particularly relevant in revisiting the question of the modernization of the banking system. I will come to that in a moment. BIS Review 68/1997 Financial Modernization and Umbrella Supervision - 5 - First I would like to point out that whether legislative agreement is reached or not  market forces will continue the modernization of the financial services industry and will further blur the lines between banks and nonbanks. For example  we can expect mutual funds to refine their offerings to compete with bank checking and savings accounts  albeit without deposit insurance. Banks will undoubtedly make further inroads in mutual fund management and investment banking through internal growth and through acquisitions of securities firms. Investment banks may also supplement their services by making commercial loans and participating in loan syndications. With such things happening  why do we need a legislative solution? The answer is that a well thought out proposal addressing the appropriate structure for the industry would allow for a more rapid and efficient integration of financial services. Moreover  by clearly defining the boundaries and structure of financial conglomerates  a well-considered supervisory program could adequately protect banks without undue intrusion to other parts of the conglomerate. Because financial conglomerates generally operate as integrated entities and manage risks on a global basis across business lines  their true operating structure superimposes a risk management and internal control process that extends across legal-entity-based corporate structures. In this light  supervision by legal entity can create important supervisory gaps that may expose the insured depository institution to unnecessary risk. That is to say  someone should look at the risk management of the organization as an organic whole  rather than as separate pieces that are simply added together. In fact  comprehensive  consolidated supervision by the home country supervisor is a legal requirement for foreign banks operating in the U.S. Some foreign supervisors are now beginning to question the consolidated supervision of U.S. firms operating in their countries. Now  I suspect some nonbank firms may feel apprehension at having an umbrella supervisor evaluate their operations. But let me emphasize that such oversight need not be overly onerous or intrusive. In fact  regulators are probably better prepared than ever before to implement an umbrella supervisory approach as a result of the supervisory techniques and approaches I just discussed. By applying risk-focused supervision  and promoting sound practices  and improved market disclosures  an umbrella supervisor should be able to implement an effective  unintrusive oversight process for conglomerates. Moreover  an umbrella supervisor may be able to provide assurances and information to other regulators and individual supervisors which may minimize their need to extend their reviews beyond the legal supervised entity and into the conglomerate’s other operations  creating duplication and burden. I believe that the umbrella supervisor  whether it is the central bank or another agency  should not attempt to duplicate efforts of other regulators. Rather  the umbrella supervisor should evaluate the financial conglomerate from a more comprehensive perspective  bridging the gap between an organization’s legal structure and its structure for taking and managing risk. Similarly  the umbrella supervisor need not attempt to extend bank-like safety and soundness regulations to nonbank entities. Those standards were never intended to apply to the nonbank entities of a conglomerate and would insert unnecessary competitive barriers without achieving the desired benefits. BIS Review 68/1997 - 6 - How exactly should an umbrella supervisor meet its responsibilities? First by focusing its supervisory efforts on the adequacy of the risk management and internal control process of the parent company and of the group as a whole  and determining how well those systems protect the safety and soundness of affiliated banks. That evaluation could be performed in a manner similar to that of a securities analyst  albeit from a different viewpoint. This assessment might involve analysis of public financial statements  rating agencies and Wall Street analyst reports  internal management reports  internal and external audit reports  meetings with management  and only limited  if any  on-site inspections of nonbank affiliates. Any visits that are made could be limited to testing the adequacy of management and operating systems  to protect the insured depository institution. While various approaches could be taken to address capital adequacy and to avoid the unnecessary or inappropriate use of double leverage  I believe such approaches should be measured against the goal of assuring the safety and soundness of the affiliated banks. And finally  the umbrella supervisor should have appropriate enforcement authority  including the authority to require the sale of the bank in extreme situations. Conclusion It is clear that the financial services industry is changing and that banking powers must also change if banks are to remain competitive. The Board has long supported reforms and strongly urges them today. However  changes such as these carry risks. It is important  therefore  that change be introduced properly through legislative debate and by adopting proper safeguards to ensure that nonbank activities do not unduly expose banks and taxpayers. The Federal Reserve is mindful of regulatory burden and of the need to accommodate change. Nevertheless  we also believe that some type of umbrella supervision will be necessary to protect insured depository institutions and address systemic risk concerns. Whoever plays that role should take a broad perspective in evaluating risks not only to specific depository institutions but also to the payment system and to the broad financial industry as well. Simply put  I believe that in an economy as complicated and integrated as we have in the United States  it is important for the nation’s central bank to have a significant role in comprehensive financial institution supervision.

The reintegration of South Africa in the world economy Good progress has been made over the past four years with the reintegration of South Africa in the world economy. The political and social changes introduced in South Africa paved the way for the removal of international economic punitive actions that partly isolated the country’s economy from the rest of the world during the ten years preceding the fully democratic election of a Government of National Unity in April 1994. Even before the election took place  the rest of the world gave its support to the moves towards democracy by lifting sanctions  boycotts  disinvestment campaigns and trade restrictions. Since 1994  the following major changes took place in South Africa’s international economic relations: (i) South Africa became a full participating member again in various multinational institutions such as the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund  the United Nations and the African Development Bank. (ii) Agreements were entered into with the World Trade Organisation for a substantial revision over a five year period in the protective import tariff structure  and certain discriminatory export subsidies were removed. (iii) Exchange controls were substantially relaxed to introduce full convertibility for current account transactions  to remove all exchange controls applicable to non-residents and gradually to lift the remaining exchange controls applicable to the outward investment of capital by South African residents. (iv) An extensive liberalisation programme of the South African financial markets included major changes in the capital market  e.g. to allow for foreign and corporate ownership of stock broking members of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange  and the opening up of the South African banking sector for foreign competition. There are now 17 foreign banks with branches and subsidiaries in South Africa  and about 60 foreign banks with representative offices. (v) A number of new bilateral  regional and international economic co-operation agreements were entered into  such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the arrangements with the European Union for closer economic co-operation. These changes have had a material effect on South Africa’s international economic relations and are reflected in a very visible way in the South African balance of payments. Over the three years 1991 to 1993  the current account of the balance of payments showed a surplus of US $5.8 billion  and the capital account a net outflow of $7.1 billion. The official foreign reserves therefore declined by $1.3 billion. When the new Government came into power in April 1994  the country had virtually no official foreign reserves left. Over the past three years  that is from 1994 to 1996  the current account of the balance of payments showed an accumulated deficit of $5.1 billion. During this period  a net BIS Review 69/1997 - 2 - capital inflow of $7.4 billion  enabled the Reserve Bank to replenish the exhausted foreign reserves gradually. At the end of June 1997  the Bank held an amount of $4.9 billion in reserves  which was still relatively low (sufficient cover for 7 weeks’ imports)  but nevertheless much better than four years ago. The balance of payments developments merely reflected the changes in total gross domestic economic activity. The average rate of change in gross domestic product over the three years 1991 to 1993 showed a decline of 0.6 per cent  compared to an average rate of increase of 3.1 per cent over the next three years. The average rate of change in gross domestic expenditure changed from a decline of 0.3 per cent per annum from 1991 to 1993  to 4.9 per cent growth over the next three years. 2. South Africa’s role in Southern Africa The developments over the past few years enabled South Africa to take on a more active part in the economic development of the Southern African region. Economic co-operation in Southern Africa has been formalised through the Southern African Development Community Treaty of August 1992  which incorporated the following goals: * To achieve development and economic growth  enhance the standard and quality of life of the peoples of Southern Africa  and support the socially disadvantaged through regional integration; * To promote and maximise productive employment and the utilisation of resources of the region; and * To achieve sustainable utilisation of natural resources and effective protection of the environment. To achieve its objectives  SADC shall: * Harmonise political and socio-economic policies and plans of member states; * Mobilise the peoples of the region and their institutions to take initiatives to develop economic  social and cultural ties across the region  and to participate fully in the implementation of the programmes and operations of SADC and its institutions; * Develop policies aimed at the progressive elimination of obstacles to free movement of capital and labour  goods and services  and of the peoples of the region generally among member states; * Promote the development of human resources; * Promote the development  transfer and mastery of technology  and * co-operation. Improve economic management and performance through regional The Treaty provides for other political  social and cultural objectives which are not of direct relevance for the enhancing of financial co-operation in the region. South Africa has been given the task to manage the Finance and Investment Sector of SADC  and the South African Reserve Bank was given the important role to co-ordinate the functions of the central banks of the twelve member states in the promotion of the SADC objectives. For this purpose  a Committee of Governors of Central Banks of SADC BIS Review 69/1997 - 3 - was created  with a small secretariat in the South African Reserve Bank  and a research unit to provide assistance to the Governors’ Committee. In drafting its mission statement  the Committee of Governors designed a model for financial co-operation that was described as a “bottom-up” approach. This approach is based on building financial co-operation by first laying an appropriate foundation in the form of an effective institutional framework for the financial system in each country. More ambitious schemes for the harmonisation or integration of macroeconomic monetary policies can be considered at a later stage  i.e.  once central banks  competitive private banking sectors and financial markets have been established on a firmer basis  and are functioning effectively in most of the participating countries. In its work programme  the Committee of Governors has made good progress with the following projects: * The development of a monetary and financial statistical data base  captured in the computer of the Reserve Bank in Pretoria  with the intention of providing real-time on-line access to the information to all participating central banks; * The development of an information bank on the policies  structures and functions of the 12 SADC central banks; * The harmonisation of the development of national payment  clearing and settlement systems within each one of the twelve SADC countries  and the eventual provision for a network of cross-border settlements in the region; * The co-ordination of exchange controls  and the gradual removal of exchange controls  in the region. South Africa is now relaxing its exchange controls still applicable to foreign capital investment by South African residents in respect of investments in other SADC countries faster than for the rest of the world; * The co-ordination of training of officials of all SADC central banks. The South African Reserve Bank has introduced a specialised Training Institute for Central Banking  and is now providing specialised courses in central banking and financial management for its own staff and officials of other central banks in the SADC region. * There is also a more ambitious training programme provided through the Macroeconomic and Financial Management Institute (MEFMI)  with its headquarters in Harare. The objective of MEFMI is to assist Governments (Treasuries) and central banks to develop internal capacity for macroeconomic management; * The development of the quality of  and capacity for  proper bank regulation and supervision. Some harmonisation is encouraged on policies such as bank licensing  minimum prudential financial requirements  and regular auditing of banking institutions. A joint effort is also being made to take the necessary steps against illegal banking activities in the region  such as money laundering and pyramid schemes. * The forum for closer co-operation amongst the central banks of the region has now been firmly established. The work of the Committee  apart from consolidating the projects so far undertaken  will now be extended to the level of the private banking sector  and of the development of financial and capital markets in the common interest of the region as a whole. BIS Review 69/1997 3. Economic challenges for South Africa - 4 - South Africa now finds itself in the challenging situation that  in one direction  its financial markets are rapidly being integrated in the global financial system  and in the other direction it is becoming more and more part of the difficult process of supporting and stimulating economic development in the Southern African region. At the same time  daunting problems still remain unsolved in the internal economy of the country. The new Government has had remarkable success over the past few years in the implementation of disciplined fiscal and monetary policies  and has gained confidence from investors and business people in its determination to apply sound economic policies in general. Little progress  however  has been made in solving one of the most urgent problems of the South African economy  and that is to create sufficient jobs for the growing population. Total employment in the country is now hardly more than what it was at the beginning of the nineties. South Africa’s economic policies must  at this stage  maintain good balance between the process of globalisation  the satisfaction of the dire basic needs of the domestic population  and the desire to assist in the economic development of the region. In a holistic approach  these various objectives are not in conflict with each other  but are in many respects supplementary. Successful participation in the global financial markets will lead to a larger inflow of foreign investment capital into South Africa  that will enable the country to do more for the upliftment of its own people  and for the development of the region. But this will subject all the macroeconomic initiatives of the country to the disciplines of the global investment community. These disciplines  tested by world-wide experience  amply reward successes  but severely punish failures. With its economic policies of the past few years  South Africa has already proved that it is determined to stand up to this challenge. The process of economic liberalisation and integration into the global markets must continue; economic co-operation in Southern Africa  and with countries further North in Africa  will be extended; the implementation of the Government’s Reconstruction and Development Programme  and the Strategy for Growth  Employment and Redistribution  will be pursued with vigour and determination. The task ahead is not an easy one. South Africa  and Africa  will need all the assistance it can get from the rest of the world. There is growing optimism that  in the early years of the 21st century  Africa will succeed in its concerted efforts to improve the living conditions of all the people of our Continent.

r970725d,1997-07-25,https://www.bis.org/review/r970725d.pdf,Mr. Stals considers the issues of the relaxation of exchange controls and raising finance on the foreign bond market (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  16 Jul 97),Speech given by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank  Dr. Chris Stals  at a luncheon of the Institute of Directors in Southern Africa in Pretoria on 16/7/97.,Mr. Stals considers the issues of the relaxation of exchange controls and raising finance on the foreign bond market Speech given by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank  Dr. Chris Stals  at a luncheon of the Institute of Directors in Southern Africa in Pretoria on 16/7/97. The extension of the relaxation of exchange controls to private individuals as from 1 July 1997  marked a further step in the Government’s committed programme of gradually phasing out all restrictions on the movement of funds between South Africa and the rest of the world. The present system of exchange controls was introduced in South Africa over many years  starting from 1961  and was mainly intended to provide some protection to the domestic economy against the adverse effects of non-economic developments in South Africa  and international reactions that followed internal developments. Since these non-economic factors were removed during 1993 and 1994  following the major social and political reforms in our country  justification for the retention of the exchange controls also disappeared. In the new situation  the retention of exchange controls became counter-productive and  in a more open and freer economic environment  created undesirable distortions in the allocation of resources. There was  therefore  general consensus that South Africa should remove exchange controls as quickly as possible  and some advisers even thought that it should be done in a one-off “big bang” approach. How desirable such an approach might have been  particularly for financial operators in the market  realism forced the Reserve Bank and the Government to opt for a gradual but determined phasing-out programme. The major constraint on the authorities had been the limited amount of foreign exchange reserves available to the country that were required for the conversion of South African rand assets into foreign currencies. Developments over the past few years enabled us to move rather fast with the removal of the exchange controls. Large inflows of foreign funds  mostly in the form of portfolio investments made by non-residents in South African equities and bonds  and inflows of short-  medium- and long-term loan capital made it possible not only to replenish the country’s net foreign reserves from a zero-level in April 1994 to more than R20 billion now  but also to remove more than 50 per cent of the exchange controls that existed three years ago. These relaxations required large amounts of funds  for example to enable South African resident companies to invest about R20 billion in foreign direct investment projects  and to enable institutional investors to diversify about R30 billion of their investments in foreign currency denominated assets. Over the three year period from the beginning of 1994 up to the end of 1996  the total net inflow of capital  that is taking account of non-resident capital inflows and resident capital outflows  showed a net gain for South Africa of almost R30 billion. The substantial capital inflows into South Africa therefore enabled us to achieve our objectives with the replenishment of the official foreign reserves  and the gradual relaxation of the exchange controls. The future programme with the removal of the remaining exchange controls will  as over the past three-and-a-half years  be very dependent on a continuation of net capitalinflows from the rest of the world. The capital inflows will  as a matter of fact  not only determine the pace of the removal of the remaining exchange controls  but also the rate of economic growth and development in the country. For South Africa it is of vital importance BIS Review 69/1997 - 2 - therefore that we shall continue to make our markets and our economy attractive to foreign investors. We may ask ourselves what foreign investors are looking for before they decide to invest in a country. What prompted them  over the past few years  to make such huge investments in South Africa? They are obviously looking for stable political and social conditions in a country. The ANC Government has certainly established itself as a stable government and has founded a credible track record with the management of the economy. Crime and violence remains a worrying aspect of the social system  and many foreign investors still prefer not to commit themselves for too long a period in making their investments here. On the economic side  the globalisation of the world financial markets is a process that countries such as South Africa cannot stay out of. Operators in these global markets are defining their own economic criteria for the assessment and comparison of countries where they can invest huge amounts of funds administered by them. These criteria may sometimes seem to be rather superficial  but they are basic. For example  the Maastricht criteria require members of the European Union to maintain a deficit on their budgets of not more than 3 per cent of gross domestic product. Total government debt should not be more than 60 per cent of gross domestic product. The rate of inflation in each participating member country should not be too far out of line with the average rate of inflation in all the participating member countries. These criteria are now being applied very generally across the board by many global fund investors when they assess the attractiveness of countries for investment purposes. It is therefore not just a whim of the South African Minister of Finance to reduce the deficit on the Budget of the South African Government to 4 per cent this year. Likewise  it is not just an over-ambitious target of the Reserve Bank to bring inflation in South Africa more in line with the average rate of inflation in the economies of our major trading partners. These are directives and requirements from the international investor community -- those investors that enabled us to achieve the results of the past three years with the exchange control relaxation and the improved economic conditions in general. They will also determine the course of the further relaxation in exchange controls and in the economic development of our country over the next few years. Because of the importance of foreign investment for South Africa  it is essential that foreign investors shall also be well-informed of the South African economy  and its potential to absorb new foreign investment. The recent decline in the gold price created a lot of nervousness in the market for foreign exchange. This is an unfortunate development that can have serious adverse implications for the gold mining industry. Its effect on the balance of payments  however  should be judged against a total level of exports of goods and services that now exceeds R150 billion per annum  with gold contributing less than 18 per cent of the total  and a total capital inflow through the Bond Market and Stock Exchange that was double the value of the gold production in the first six months of 1997. The average gold price last year was equal to US $388 per fine ounce  and South Africa’s total gold exports amounted to 15.75 million ounces. Should the present price of $320 be maintained for a full year  the loss in foreign exchange on the balance of payments will amount to R4.5 billion  or less than 3 per cent of total exports. Relative to the volatility of the net capital movements  the amount should not create any undue pressure on the rand/foreign currency exchange rate. Part of this loss can also be made up with an increase in the volume of production and with increases in other exports. We should also not be too negative for some recovery of the gold price before the end of this year. If anything  the recent decline in the gold price provides further evidence of how important it is for South Africa to continue to attract BIS Review 69/1997 - 3 - more foreign investment into the country  particularly in the form of long-term direct investments. 2. Raising finance on the foreign bond market The South African Government recently made two further very successful issues in international capital markets. An issue in the Samurai Yen market raised the equivalent of $357 million for seven years  and an issue in the American Yankee market provided an amount of $500 million for a twenty-year period. Both these loans were raised at relatively attractive interest rates. The international private financial markets have developed very rapidly in recent years  and now provide for the needs of many types of borrowers. Only sovereign borrowers  however  and large multinational corporations will be able to raise funds through public issues in these markets. Many other types of foreign loan facilities are  however  available to other borrowers. It is known that the Reserve Bank is at present busy negotiating for a syndicated loan with a group of foreign banking institutions for $1½ billion. Smaller borrowers can  of course  also negotiate loans on a bilateral basis with one of the many foreign banking institutions that provide their services in the South African markets. It is fairly easy for reputable and established South African organisations at this stage to raise foreign funds. Non-residents are no longer affected by the remaining exchange controls  and accept the credibility of the South African authorities in their determination gradually to remove the remaining controls. One major constraint  however  is provided by the volatility of exchange rates  even amongst the major currencies of the world. It is not only the South African rand that showed great volatility over the past year  but also many other currencies. The exchange rate between the Deutsche Mark and the US dollar  for example  changed from $1=1.54DM at the beginning of January 1997  to $1=1.79DM today  i.e. a change of 16.2 per cent. At this stage  the Malaysian ringgit  the Thai baht  the Indonesian rupiah  the Philippine peso and the Czech koruna are all under pressure from international currency speculators. South African borrowers of foreign funds will therefore most probably prefer to cover foreign borrowings with forward exchange contracts  which will eliminate any cost advantages from lower interest rates in other countries. We nevertheless believe that it is in the interest of the South African economy to make use of foreign finance where available  as this will enable the country to maintain a higher rate of economic development. We are indeed confident that  if carefully managed  the relaxation of exchange controls for residents will not lead to an overall net outflow of capital from the country. New investments by non-residents should continue to exceed the outward investment by residents. BIS Review 69/1997

According to the business leaders surveyed by the Banque de France  industrial output continued to make progress in June. Output of consumer and intermediate goods advanced significantly  with a more moderate increase for capital goods  whereas it levelled out in the food-processing industry and slightly dipped in the automobile industry. Capacity utilization rates recovered. Overall demand strengthened both in France and abroad. Export sales grew considerably  in particular to Great Britain  Italy and the United States. Domestic demand rose  stimulated to some extent by inventory replenishment. Order books seem generally satisfactory. While they have emptied out somewhat in the food processing industry  they remain on the full side in the capital goods sector. Inventories are only just above desired levels  despite an increase in the consumer goods sector  and above all in the automobile and food processing industries. In the coming months  activity is likely to intensify across the board  except for the automobile sector which is expected to stabilize. Overall  raw material and finished goods prices changed little. The cost of supplies climbed in certain branches of the intermediate goods sector  mainly due to the rise in the dollar  although these increases were not passed on to sales prices. Business managers continued to take a cautious stance on investment. The little capital expenditure there was primarily concerned the modernisation of equipment and bringing it into line with standards. Retail activity  which was buoyant in May  fell back in June partly due to poor weather conditions. In aggregate  activity was up over the last two months. The construction and civil engineering sector1 recovered in the second quarter of 1997 primarily as a result of seasonal factors. Employment levels held steady in industry  except for the automobile sector  where there was a further contraction  and the building  retail and market services sectors. Wherever possible  companies sought to enhance workforce flexibility via temporary staff and overtime  in order to cope with fluctuating demand and organize themselves for the summer vacation period. 1 Unadjusted data.

I am pleased to appear before this Subcommittee to present the Federal Reserve’s report on the economic situation and monetary policy. The recent performance of the economy  characterized by strong growth and low inflation  has been exceptional -- and better than most anticipated. During the first quarter of 1997  real gross domestic product expanded at nearly a 6 percent annual rate  after posting a 3 percent increase over 1996. Activity apparently continued to expand in the second quarter  albeit at a more moderate pace. The economy is now in the seventh consecutive year of expansion  making it the third longest post-World War II cyclical upswing to date. Moreover  our Federal Reserve Banks indicate that economic activity is on the rise  and at a relatively high level  in virtually every geographic region and community of the nation. The expansion has been balanced  in that inventories  as well as stocks of business capital and other durable assets  have been kept closely in line with spending  so overhangs have been small and readily corrected. This strong expansion has produced a remarkable increase in work opportunities for Americans. A net of more than thirteen million jobs has been created since the current period of growth began in the spring of 1991. As a consequence  the unemployment rate has fallen to 5 percent -- its lowest level in almost a quarter century. The expansion has enabled many in the working-age population  a large number of whom would have otherwise remained out of the labor force or among the longer-term unemployed  to acquire work experience and improved skills. Our whole economy will benefit from their greater productivity. To be sure  not all segments of our population are fully sharing in the economic improvement. Some Americans still have trouble finding jobs  and for part of our work force real wage stagnation persists. In contrast to the typical postwar business cycle  measured price inflation is lower now than when the expansion began and has shown little tendency to rebound of late  despite high rates of resource utilization. In the business sector  producer prices have fallen in each of the past six months. Consumers also are enjoying low inflation. The consumer price index rose at less than a 2 percent annual rate over the first half of the year  down from a little over 3 percent in 1996. With the economy performing so well for so long  financial markets have been buoyant  as memories of past business and financial cycles fade with time. Soaring prices in the stock market have been fuelled by moderate long-term interest rates and expectations of investors that profit margins and earnings growth will hold steady  or even increase further  in a relatively stable  low-inflation environment. Credit spreads at depository institutions and in the open market have remained extremely narrow by historical standards  suggesting a high degree of confidence among lenders regarding the prospects for credit repayment. The key questions facing financial markets and policy makers are: ""What is behind the good performance of the economy?"" and ""Will it persist?"" Without question  the exceptional economic situation reflects some temporary factors that have been restraining inflation rates. In addition  however  important pieces of information  while just suggestive at this point  could be read as indicating basic improvements in the longer-term efficiency of our BIS Review 70/1997 - 2 - economy. The Federal Reserve has been aware of this possibility in our monetary policy deliberations and  as always  has operated with a view to supplying adequate liquidity to allow the economy to reach its highest potential on a sustainable basis. Nonetheless  we also recognize that the capacity of our economy to produce goods and services is not without limit. If demand were to outrun supply  inflationary imbalances would eventually develop that would tend to undermine the current expansion and inhibit the long-run growth potential of the economy. Because monetary policy works with a significant lag  policy actions are directed at a future that may not be clearly evident in current experience. This leads to policy judgements that are by their nature calibrated to the relative probabilities of differing outcomes. We moved the federal funds rate higher in March because we perceived the probability of demand outstripping supply to have increased to a point where inaction would have put at risk the solid elements of support that have sustained this expansion and made it so beneficial. In making such judgements in March and in the future  we need to analyze carefully the various forces that may be affecting the balance of supply and demand in the economy  including those that may be responsible for its exceptional recent behavior. The remainder of my testimony will address the various possibilities. Inflation  Output  and Technological Change in the 1990s Many observers  including us  have been puzzled about how an economy  operating at high levels and drawing into employment increasingly less-experienced workers  can still produce subdued and  by some measures even falling  inflation rates. It will  doubtless  be several years before we know with any conviction the full story of the surprisingly benign combination of output and prices that has marked the business expansion of the last six years. Certainly  public policy has played an important role. Administration and Congressional actions to curtail budget deficits have enabled long-term interest rates to move lower  encouraging private efficiency-enhancing capital investment. Deregulation in a number of industries has fostered competition and held down prices. Finally  the pre-emptive actions of the Federal Reserve in 1994 contained a potentially destabilizing surge in demand  short-circuiting a boom-bust business cycle in the making and keeping inflation low to encourage business innovation. But the fuller explanation of the recent extraordinary performance may well lie deeper. In February 1996  I raised before this Committee a hypothesis tying together technological change and cost pressures that could explain what was even then a puzzling quiescence of inflation. The new information received in the last eighteen months remains consistent with those earlier notions; indeed  some additional pieces of the puzzle appear to be falling into place. A surge in capital investment in high tech equipment that began in early 1993 has since strengthened. Purchases of computer and telecommunications equipment have risen at a more than 14 percent annual rate since early 1993 in nominal terms  and at an astonishing rate of nearly 25 percent in real terms  reflecting the fall in the prices of this equipment. Presumably companies have come to perceive a significant increase in profit opportunities from exploiting the improved productivity of these new technologies. BIS Review 70/1997 - 3 - It is premature to judge definitively whether these business perceptions are the harbinger of a more general and persistent improvement in productivity. Supporting this possibility  productivity growth  which often suffers as business expansions mature  has not followed that pattern. In addition  profit margins remain high in the face of pickups in compensation growth  suggesting that businesses continue to find new ways to enhance their efficiency. Nonetheless  although the anecdotal evidence is ample and manufacturing productivity has picked up  a change in the underlying trend is not yet reflected in our conventional data for the whole economy. But even if the perceived quicker pace of application of our newer technologies turns out to be mere wheel-spinning rather than true productivity advance  it has brought with it a heightened sense of job insecurity and  as a consequence  subdued wage gains. As I pointed out here last February  polls indicated that despite the significant fall in the unemployment rate  the proportion of workers in larger establishments fearful of being laid off rose from 25 percent in 1991 to 46 percent by 1996. It should not have been surprising then that strike activity in the 1990s has been lower than it has been in decades and that new labor union contracts have been longer and have given greater emphasis to job security. Nor should it have been unexpected that the number of workers voluntarily leaving their jobs to seek other employment has not risen in this period of tight labor markets. To be sure  since last year  surveys have indicated that the proportion of workers fearful of layoff has stabilized and the number of voluntary job leavers has edged up. And  indeed  perhaps as a consequence  wage gains have accelerated some. But increases in the Employment Cost Index still trail behind what previous relationships to tight labor markets would have suggested  and a lingering sense of fear or uncertainty seems still to pervade the job market  though to a somewhat lesser extent. Consumer surveys do indicate greater optimism about the economy. However  it is one thing to believe that the economy  indeed the job market  will do well overall  but quite another to feel secure about one’s individual situation  given the accelerated pace of corporate restructuring and the heightened fear of skill obsolescence that has apparently characterized this expansion. Persisting insecurity would help explain why measured personal saving rates have not declined as would have been expected from the huge increase in stock market wealth. We will  however  have a better fix on savings rates after the coming benchmark revisions to the national income and product accounts. The combination in recent years of subdued compensation per hour and solid productivity advances has meant that unit labor costs of non financial corporations have barely moved. Moreover  when you combine unit labor costs with non labor costs -- which account for one-quarter of total costs on a consolidated basis -- total unit costs for the year ended in the first quarter of 1997 rose only about half a percent. Hence  a significant part of the measured price increase over that period was attributable to a rise in profit margins  unusual well into a business expansion. Rising margins are further evidence suggesting that productivity gains have been unexpectedly strong; in these situations  real labor compensation usually catches up only with a lag. While accelerated technological change may well be an important element in unravelling the current economic puzzle  there have been other influences at play as well in restraining price increases at high levels of resource utilization. The strong dollar of the last two years has pared import prices and constrained the pricing behavior of domestic firms facing import competition. Increasing globalization has enabled greater specialization over a wider BIS Review 70/1997 - 4 - array of goods and services  in effect allowing comparative advantage to hold down costs and enhance efficiencies. Increased deregulation of telecommunications  motor and rail transport  utilities  and finance doubtless has been a factor restraining prices  as perhaps has the reduced market power of labor unions. Certainly  changes in the health care industry and the pricing of health services have greatly contributed to holding down growth in the cost of benefits  and hence overall labor compensation. Many of these forces are limited or temporary  and their effects can be expected to diminish  at which time cost and price pressures would tend to re-emerge. The effects of an increased rate of technological change might be more persistent  but they too could not permanently hold down inflation if the Federal Reserve allows excess liquidity to flood financial markets. I have noted to you before the likelihood that at some point workers might no longer be willing to restrain wage gains for added security  at which time accelerating unit labor costs could begin to press on profit margins and prices  should monetary policy be too accommodative. When I discuss greater technological change  I am not referring primarily to a particular new invention. Instead  I have in mind the increasingly successful and pervasive application of recent technological advances  especially in telecommunications and computers  to enhance efficiencies in production processes throughout the economy. Many of these technologies have been around for some time. Why might they be having a more pronounced effect now? In an intriguing paper prepared for a conference last year sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  Professor Nathan Rosenberg of Stanford documented how  in the past  it often took a considerable period of time for the necessary synergies to develop between different forms of capital and technologies. One example is the invention of the dynamo in the mid 1800s. Rosenberg’s colleague Professor Paul David had noted a number of years ago that it wasn’t until the 1920s that critical complementary technologies of the dynamo -- for example  the electric motor as the primary source of mechanical drive in factories  and central generating stations -- were developed and in place and that production processes had fully adapted to these inventions. What we may be observing in the current environment is a number of key technologies  some even mature  finally interacting to create significant new opportunities for value creation. For example  the applications for the laser were modest until the later development of fiber optics engendered a revolution in telecommunications. Broad advances in software have enabled us to capitalize on the prodigious gains in hardware capacity. The interaction of both of these has created the Internet. The accelerated synergies of the various technologies may be what have been creating the apparent significant new profit opportunities that presumably lie at the root of the recent boom in high-tech investment. An expected result of the widespread and effective application of information and other technologies would be a significant increase in productivity and reduction in business costs. We do not now know  nor do I suspect can anyone know  whether current developments are part of a once or twice in a century phenomenon that will carry productivity trends nationally and globally to a new higher track  or whether we are merely observing some unusual variations within the context of an otherwise generally conventional business cycle expansion. The recent improvement in productivity could be just transitory  an artifact of a temporary surge in demand and output growth. In view of the slowing in growth in the second BIS Review 70/1997 - 5 - quarter and the more moderate expansion widely expected going forward  data for profit margins on domestic operations and productivity from the second quarter on will be especially relevant in assessing whether recent improvements are structural or cyclical. Whatever the trend in productivity and  by extension  overall sustainable economic growth  from the Federal Reserve’s point of view  the faster the better. We see our job as fostering the degree of liquidity that will best support the most effective platform for growth to flourish. We believe a non inflationary environment is such a platform because it promotes long-term planning and capital investment and keeps the pressure on businesses to contain costs and enhance efficiency. The Federal Reserve’s policy problem is not with growth  but with maintaining an effective platform. To do so  we endeavor to prevent strains from developing in our economic system  which long experience tells us produce bottlenecks  shortages  and inefficiencies. These eventually create more inflation  which undermines economic expansion and limits the longer-term potential of the economy. In gauging the potential for oncoming strains  it is the effective capacity of the economy to produce that is important to us. An economy operating at a high level of utilization and growing 5 percent a year is in little difficulty if capacity is growing at least that fast. But a fully utilized economy growing at 1 percent will eventually get into trouble if capacity is growing less than that. Capacity itself  however  is a complex concept  which requires a separate evaluation of its two components  capital and labor. It appears that capital  that is  plant and equipment  can adapt and expand more expeditiously than in the past to meet demands. Hence  capital capacity is now a considerably less rigid constraint than it once was. In recent years  technology has engendered a significant compression of lead times between order and delivery for production facilities. This has enabled output to respond increasingly faster to an upsurge in demand  thereby decreasing the incidence of strains on capital capacity and shortages so evident in earlier business expansions. Reflecting progressively shorter lead times for capital equipment  unfilled orders to shipment ratios for non-defense capital goods have declined by 30 percent in the last six years. Not only do producers have quicker access to equipment that embodies the most recent advances  but they have been able to adjust their overall capital stock more rapidly to increases in demand. The current lack of material shortages and bottlenecks  despite the high level and recent robust expansion of demand  is striking. The effective capacity of production facilities has increased substantially in recent years in response to strong final demands and the influence of cost reductions possible with the newer technologies. Increased flexibility is particularly evident in the computer  telecommunications  and related industries  a segment of our economy that seems far less subject to physical capacity constraints than many older-line establishments  and one that is assuming greater importance in our overall output. But the shortening of lags has been pervasive even in more mature industries  owing in part to the application of advanced technologies to production methods. At the extreme  if all capital goods could be produced at constant cost and on demand  the size of our nation’s capital stock would never pose a restraint on production. We are BIS Review 70/1997 - 6 - obviously very far from that nirvana  but it is important to note that we are also far from the situation a half-century ago when our production processes were dominated by equipment such as open hearth steel furnaces  which had very exacting limits on how much they could produce in a fixed time frame and which required huge lead times to expand their capacity. Even so  today’s economy as a whole still can face capacity constraints from its facilities. Indeed  just three years ago  bottlenecks in industrial production -- though less extensive than in years past at high levels of measured capacity utilization -- were nonetheless putting significant upward pressures on prices at earlier stages of production. More recently vendor performance has deteriorated somewhat  indicating that flexibility to meet demands still has limits. Although further strides toward greater facilities flexibility have occurred since 1994  this is clearly an evolutionary  not a revolutionary  process. Labor Markets Moreover  technology and management changes have had only a limited effect on the ability of labor supply to respond to changes in demand. To be sure  individual firms have acquired additional flexibility by increased use of outsourcing and temporary workers. In addition  smaller work teams can adapt more readily to variations in order flows. While these techniques put the right workers at the right spots to reduce bottlenecks  they do not increase the aggregate supply of labor. That supply is sensitive to changes in demand  but to a far more limited extent than for facilities. New plants can almost always be built. But labor capacity for an individual country is constrained by the size of the working-age population  which  except for immigration  is basically determined several decades in the past. Of course  capital facilities and labor are not fully separate markets. Within limits  labor and capital are substitutes  and slack in one market can offset tightness in another. For example  additional work shifts can expand output without significant addition to facilities  and similarly more labor-displacing equipment can permit production to be increased with the same level of employment. Yet despite significant increases in capital equipment in recent years  new additions to labor supply have been inadequate to meet the demand for labor. As a consequence  the recent period has been one of significant reduction in labor market slack. Of the more than two million net new hires at an annual rate since early 1994  only about half have come from an expansion in the population aged 16 to 64 who wanted a job  and more than a third of those were net new immigrants. The remaining one million plus per year increase in employment has been pulled from those who had been reported as unemployed (600 thousand annually) and those who wanted  but had not actively sought  a job (more than 400 thousand annually). The latter  of course  are not in the official unemployment count. The key point is that continuously digging ever deeper into the available work age population is not a sustainable trajectory for job creation. The unemployment rate has a downside limit if for no other reason than unemployment  in part  reflects voluntary periods of job search and other frictional unemployment. There is also a limit on how many of the additional 5 million who wanted a job last quarter but were not actively seeking one could be readily absorbed into jobs -- in particular  the large number enrolled in school  and those who may lack the necessary skills or face other barriers to taking jobs. The rise in the average workweek since early 1996 suggests employers are having increasingly greater difficulty fitting BIS Review 70/1997 - 7 - the millions who want a job into available job slots. If the pace of job creation continues  the pressures on wages and other costs of hiring increasing numbers of such individuals could escalate more rapidly. To be sure  there remain an additional 34 million in the working-age population (age 16 - 64) who say they do not want a job. Presumably  some of these early retirees  students  or homemakers might be attracted to the job market if it became sufficiently rewarding. However  making it attractive enough could also involve upward pressures in real wages that would trigger renewed price pressures  undermining the expansion. Thus  there would seem to be emerging constraints on potential labor input. Even before we reach the ultimate limit of sustainable labor supply growth  the economy’s ability to expand employment at the recent rate should rapidly diminish. The availability of unemployed labor could no longer add to growth  irrespective of the degree of slack in physical facilities at that time. Simply adding new facilities will not increase production unless output per worker improves. Such improvements are possible if worker skills increase  but such gains come slowly through improved education and on-the-job training. They are also possible as capital substitutes for labor  but are limited by the state of technology. More significant advances require technological breakthroughs. At the cutting edge of technology  where America finds itself  major improvements cannot be produced on demand. New ideas that matter are hard won. The Economic Outlook As I noted  the recent performance of the labor markets suggests that the economy was on an unsustainable track. Unless aggregate demand increases more slowly than it has in recent years -- more in line with trends in the supply of labor and productivity -- imbalances will emerge. We do not know  however  at what point pressures would develop -- or indeed whether the economy is already close to that point. Fortunately  the very rapid growth of demand over the winter has eased recently. To an extent this easing seems to reflect some falloff in growth of demand for consumer durables and for inventories to a pace more in line with moderate expansion in income. But some of the recent slower growth could simply be a product of abnormal weather patterns  which contributed to a first-quarter surge in output and weakened the second quarter  in which case the underlying trend could be somewhat higher than suggested by the second-quarter data alone. Certainly  business and consumer confidence remains high and financial conditions are supportive of growth. Particularly notable is the run-up in stock market wealth  the full effects of which apparently have not been reflected in overall demand  but might yet be. Monetary policymakers  balancing these various forces  forecast a continuation of less rapid growth in coming quarters. For 1997 as a whole  the central tendency of their forecasts has real GDP growing 3 to 3¼ percent. This would be much more brisk than was anticipated in February  and the upward revision to this estimate largely reflects the unexpectedly strong first quarter. The central tendency of monetary policymakers’ projections is that real GDP will expand 2 to 2½ percent in 1998. This pace of expansion is expected to keep the unemployment rate close to its current low level. We are reasonably confident that inflation will be quite modest for 1997 as a whole. The central tendency of the forecasts is that consumer prices will rise only 2¼ to 2½ BIS Review 70/1997 - 8 - percent this year. This would be a significantly better outcome than the 2¾ to 3 percent CPI inflation foreseen in February. Federal Open Market Committee members do see higher rates of inflation next year. The central tendency of the projections is that CPI inflation will be 2½ to 3 percent in 1998 -- a little above the expectation for this year. However  much of this increase is presumed to result from the absence of temporary factors that are holding down inflation this year. In particular  the favorable movements in food and energy prices of 1997 are unlikely to be repeated  and non-oil import prices may not continue to decline. While it is possible that better productivity trends and subdued wage growth will continue to help damp the increases in business costs associated with tight labor markets  this is a situation that the Federal Reserve plans to monitor closely. I have no doubt that the current stance of policy -- characterized by a nominal federal funds rate around 5½ percent -- will need to be changed at some point to foster sustainable growth and low inflation. Adjustments in the policy instrument in response to new information are a necessary and  I should like to emphasize  routine aspect of responsible policy making. For the present  as I indicated  demand growth does appear to have moderated  but whether that moderation will be sufficient to avoid putting additional pressures on resources is an open question. With considerable momentum behind the expansion and labor market utilization rates unusually high  the Federal Reserve must be alert to the possibility that additional action might be called for to forestall excessive credit creation. The Federal Reserve is intent on gearing its policy to facilitate the maximum sustainable growth of the economy  but it is not  as some commentators have suggested  involved in an experiment that deliberately prods the economy to see how far and fast it can grow. The costs of a failed experiment would be much too burdensome for too many of our citizens. Clearly  in considering issues of monetary policy we need to distinguish carefully between sustainable economic growth and unsustainable accelerations of activity. Sustainable growth reflects the increased capacity of the economic system to produce goods and services over the longer run. It is largely the sum of increases in productivity and in the labor force. That growth contrasts with a second type  a more transitory growth. An economy producing near capacity can expand faster for a short time  often through unsustainably low short-term interest rates and excess credit creation. But this is not growth that promotes lasting increases in standards of living and in jobs for our nation. Rather  it is a growth that creates instability and thereby inhibits the achievement of our nation’s economic goals. The key question is how monetary policy can best foster the highest rate of sustainable growth and avoid amplifying swings in output  employment  and prices. The historical evidence is unambiguous that excessive creation of credit and liquidity contributes nothing to the long-run growth of our productive potential and much to costly shorter-term fluctuations. Moreover  it promotes inflation  impairing the economy’s longer-term potential output. Our objective has never been to contain inflation as an end in itself  but rather as a precondition for the highest possible long-run growth of output and income -- the ultimate goal of macroeconomic policy. BIS Review 70/1997 - 9 - In considering possible adjustments of policy to achieve that goal  the issue of lags in the effects of monetary policy is crucial. The evidence clearly demonstrates that monetary policy affects the financial markets immediately but works with significant lags on output  employment  and prices. Thus  as I pointed out earlier  policy needs to be made today on the basis of likely economic conditions in the future. As a consequence  and in the absence of once-reliable monetary guides to policy  there is no alternative to formulating policy using risk-reward trade-offs based on what are  unavoidably  uncertain forecasts. Operating on uncertain forecasts  of course  is not unusual. People do it every day  consciously or subconsciously. A driver might tap the brakes to make sure not to be hit by a truck coming down the street  even if he thinks the chances of such an event are relatively low; the costs of being wrong are simply too high. Similarly  in conducting monetary policy the Federal Reserve needs constantly to look down the road to gauge the future risks to the economy and act accordingly. Growth of Money and Credit The view that the Federal Reserve’s best contribution to growth is to foster price stability has informed both our tactical decisions on the stance of monetary policy and our longer-run judgements on appropriate rates of liquidity provision. To be sure  growth rates of monetary and credit aggregates have become less reliable as guides for monetary policy as a result of rapid change in our financial system. As I have reported to you previously  the current uncertainties regarding the behavior of the monetary aggregates have implied that we have been unable to employ them as guides to short-run policy decisions. Accordingly  in recent years we have reported annual ranges for money growth that serve as benchmarks under conditions of price stability and a return to historically stable patterns of velocity. Over the past several years  the monetary aggregates -- M2 in particular -- have shown some signs of re-establishing such stable patterns. The velocity of M2 has fluctuated in a relatively narrow range  and some of its variation within that range has been explained by interest rate movements  in a relationship similar to that established over earlier decades. We find this an encouraging development  and it is possible that at some point the FOMC might elect to put more weight on such monetary quantities in the conduct of policy. But in our view  sufficient evidence has not yet accumulated to support such a judgement. Consequently  we have decided to keep the existing ranges of growth for money and credit for 1997 and carry them over to next year  retaining the interpretation of the money ranges as benchmarks for the achievement of price stability. With nominal income growth strong relative to the rate that would likely prevail under conditions of price stability  the growth of M2 is likely to run in the upper part of its range both this year and next  while M3 could run a little above its cone. Domestic non financial sector debt is likely to remain well within its range  with private debt growth brisk and federal debt growth subdued. Although any tendency for the aggregates to exceed their ranges would not  in the event  necessarily call for an examination of whether a policy adjustment was needed  the Federal Reserve will be closely examining financial market prices and flows in the context of a broad range of economic and price indicators for evidence that the sustainability of the economic expansion may be in jeopardy. BIS Review 70/1997 Concluding Comment - 10 - The Federal Reserve recognizes  of course  that monetary policy does not determine the economy’s potential. All that it can do is help establish sound money and a stable financial environment in which the inherent vitality of a market economy can flourish and promote the capital investment that in the long run is the basis for vigorous economic growth. Similarly  other government policies also have a major role to play in contributing to economic growth. A continued emphasis on market mechanisms through deregulation will help sharpen incentives to work  save  invest  and innovate. Similarly  a fiscal policy oriented toward limited growth in government expenditures  producing smaller budget deficits and even budget surpluses  would tend to lower real interest rates even further  also promoting capital investment. The recent experience provides striking evidence of the potential for the continuation and extension of monetary  fiscal  and structural policies to enhance our economy’s performance in the period ahead.

Japan’s economy continues on a moderate recovery trend. Production and income are showing underlying firmness despite the continued reaction to the temporary surge in demand ahead of the consumption tax hike. Among final demand items  public-sector investment has been on a decreasing trend  and housing investment has been somewhat lackluster  particularly as a result of the reaction to the rise in demand ahead of the consumption tax hike. On the other hand  net exports have recently increased significantly and business fixed investment has been rising steadily. Despite the continued decline in demand which followed the rise ahead of the consumption tax hike  particularly in consumer durables  the recovery trend in personal consumption does not seem to have been hindered. In these circumstances  industrial production has been firm and the growth in employees’ income has been rising steadily  albeit moderately. Price indices were pushed up in April 1997 by the consumption tax hike  but excluding this factor  prices have been stable. Both quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year changes in domestic wholesale prices (adjusted for seasonal electricity rates) have been near zero  and the year-to-year declines in corporate service prices have narrowed. The year-to-year rises in consumer prices (nationwide  excluding perishables) are widening somewhat  albeit by a small margin. Changes in commercial land prices have varied by type  and residential land prices have virtually stopped declining. 2. In the financial markets  the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) stayed slightly below the official discount rate of 0.5 per cent. The long-term government bond yield rebounded to near 2.7 per cent in late May  as market uncertainties about the economic outlook and the Japanese financial system gradually subsided after the second half of April. However  it declined to around 2.2 - 2.3 per cent. Stock prices rose to ¥20 000 - 21 000 in May and June 1997  and have recently been fluctuating without showing clear direction. In the foreign exchange market  the yen reached ¥127 to the U.S. dollar in early May  but later appreciated and has recently moved at around ¥113 - 116 to the U.S. dollar. With respect to the fund-raising activities by firms  growth in bank lending continues to be lackluster but fund-raising through the capital market has been high  particularly in straight bonds. Growth in monetary aggregates in terms of M2 + CDs year-to-year average outstanding has continued at around 3.0 per cent. 3. Looking at individual components of final demand  public-sector investment will be supported by implementation of public works included in the government’s supplementary budget for fiscal 1996 for the time being  but it is expected to follow a declining trend. Net exports  on the other hand  are likely to continue to be steady even after the recent large increase. This reflects the robust increase in overseas demand  and the recovery in the price competitiveness of Japan’s manufacturing industry supported by the yen’s depreciation until early spring. In these circumstances  corporate profits on the whole are expected to continue improving in fiscal 1997 although with varied strength across sectors. Business fixed investment is also expected to continue increasing  mainly reflecting 1) increases in corporate profits  2) further progress in capital stock adjustments  and 3) the rise in information-related investment. However  because of the remaining balance-sheet adjustment pressures and the BIS Review /1997 - 2 - absence of leading industries  the increase in business fixed investment is unlikely to gather significant momentum for the time being. The growth in the employees’ income has been rising gradually owing to the increase in bonus payments and the moderate recovery in employment growth  reflecting the improvement in the labor market conditions. This shows that the recovery in the business sector has spread to the household sector. Thus  recovery in personal consumption is expected to continue after the reaction to the rise in demand ahead of the consumption tax hike subsides in the near future. However  the pace of recovery is likely to be moderate considering the increases in the tax burden  such as the rise in the consumption tax. Meanwhile  housing investment  which is in a generally favorable environment including low interest rates  is expected to recover somewhat in the second half of fiscal 1997  although it has recently been weak reflecting the reaction to the surge in demand ahead of the consumption tax hike. 4. With respect to price developments  the downward pressure on domestic prices from the increase in manufactured imports has weakened  as the rise in import penetration rate has paused. On the other hand  the upward pressure on import costs from materials prices has also subsided owing to the decline in crude oil prices since spring 1997 and the appreciation of the yen. Thus  import prices are not exerting significant upward nor downward pressure on domestic prices. Meanwhile  final demand will continue to recover on the whole  but the output gap is unlikely to narrow significantly as the pace of recovery in final demand is expected to be moderate. In these circumstances  prices are expected to be stable for some time. 5. In sum  the positive cycle among production  income and expenditure continues steadily and is reflected in the improvement in corporate profits and the rise in employees’ income. Thus  despite the restraining pressures from fiscal policies  including the consumption tax hike and the decline in public-sector investment  Japan’s economy is expected to continue its recovery  supported by the yen’s depreciation until early spring and the expansion of information-related demand. However  the economic recovery is unlikely to gather significant momentum  as a result of fragility in some sectors  as well as the continued balance- sheet adjustment pressure. In these circumstances  building an economic environment which increases the confidence of the private sector is vital to strengthening the economic recovery. In this process  effective structural reforms to draw out the dynamism inherent in the economy continue to be essential in addition to appropriate macroeconomic policies.

Thompson  to the Australian Institute of Banking and Finance in Canberra on 12/6/97.,Mr. Thompson discusses the many faces of risk in banking in Australia Talk by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia  Mr. G.J. Thompson  to the Australian Institute of Banking and Finance in Canberra on 12/6/97. Introduction I would like to talk today about various aspects of risk in banking. One modern notion is that banking essentially consists of processing information and managing risk. While the average person in the street probably has a more prosaic - not to say jaundiced - view of banks  risk management is indeed very much a core activity for bankers. And it is of fundamental concern to bank supervisors  such as the RBA  that banks are doing this job reasonably well - that all the big risks are identified clearly  measured accurately  monitored continuously and kept within prudent bounds. Bank supervision in recent years has focused much more intensively on the quality of the systems which banks use for these tasks. It seems that banks and their supervisors are having to contend with a steadily growing array of risks. Derivatives risk  operational risk and environmental risk have all come to prominence in the past decade or so. And public relations risk is a major ongoing challenge for banks! One even hears occasionally of “regulation risk” - which seems to relate to the capricious demands of regulatory agencies. Needless to say  this one has not been high on our list of concerns for the Australian banking system! I propose to touch on only three areas of banking risk: old-fashioned credit risk; interbank settlement risk; and the Year 2000 problem - a kind of operational risk visited upon the world by the approach of the new millenium  and the short-sightedness of 1970s computer programmers with a penchant for abbreviation! Credit risk All of the major periods of stress in Australian banking have been caused by credit losses. In the most recent episode - in the late 1980s and early 1990s - banks wrote off over $25 billion in loan losses. There have been recent comments from some bankers and others that lending standards are slackening once again  perhaps threatening another such round. One reaction would be that these comments are rather alarmist. After all  on most indicators  banks’ asset quality position is very sound. Impaired loans are less than one per cent of their total assets  the lowest point since we started collecting statistics seven years ago. Furthermore  the rate at which assets are becoming impaired has been stable for some time  and shows no signs of an upturn. “Past due” loans kicked up in 1995 and early 1996 but have stabilised recently  still at relatively low levels. BIS Review 71/1997 - 2 - The broader environment also has fewer worrying features than in the 1980s: aggregate bank credit is expanding much less rapidly than then (although inflation rates are also down quite a bit); the financial position of business borrowers is generally quite healthy with debt to equity ratios lower  and interest coverage higher  than in the late 1980s; and while asset prices are rising  there is no sign of the bubbles we saw in the 1980s; commercial property prices are up only modestly from their low points of 1993. We also have the general impression that banks have a better handle on their credit risks than they did ten years ago. With more centralised credit management  banks can now aggregate exposures to clients and industries  a basic capability which was sadly lacking then. Some of the bigger banks have specialised units to monitor their property exposures. I also suspect that the corporate structures which contributed to problems in the late 1980s are less likely to be tolerated by lenders today. This is all reassuring  but it is certainly no reason for complacency. There is little doubt that current lending standards are less stringent than they were a couple of years ago. Our observations during visits to banks support the market anecdotes on this. There has been a clear narrowing in interest margins for big corporate borrowers and some relaxation in the loan covenants which apply. It’s only a slight exaggeration to say that high quality corporate borrowers can virtually write their own terms and conditions; and some lenders are prepared to lend for very long terms at low margins. For lesser quality clients there appears to have been some drift back toward negative pledge and interest-only lending. The main reason for this is more intense competition among all banks as they strive to keep or build market share in an environment where it is also becoming easier for major corporates to tap debt markets directly. At the smaller end of the market the signs of looser lending standards are less clear. We have  however  seen more facilities where requirements for personal guarantees have been relaxed. It’s also possible that some of the regional banks might  in their eagerness to diversify loan portfolios  be lending to clients that major banks are turning away. It is  of course  not possible to interpret all these trends unequivocally as indicators of unsound banking. And it would be unrealistic to expect impaired assets to stay as low as they are now. Credit quality necessarily ebbs and flows with the fortunes of the economy and particular sectors. What is important is that any deterioration is manageable against banks’ capital  and that they recognise early the need for additional provisions. On balance  we believe that some current lending practices do risk sowing the seeds of future credit quality problems for banks. Chief executives and boards should be considering carefully whether the additional point of market share that might be won now by lending to marginal propositions is worth the pain of future losses  the resources needed for loan workouts  and so on. They should also be alert to the possibility that the household sector might feature more strongly in the next upswing of losses. Household debt has increased a good deal more quickly than incomes in recent years. BIS Review 71/1997 - 3 - The RBA recently organised a Credit Conference to review trends in credit risk management  with participants including a number of leading bankers and accountants. A volume of readings and a summary of discussion will be published soon. The main theme from the Conference was how credit risk assessment and management are becoming more objective  more scientific. One speaker described this as moving from an “experience-centric” approach to “data-centric” models. With standard products such as mortgages  consumer loans  credit cards and (to some extent) small business loans  quite sophisticated statistical methods are beginning to be applied to estimating default risk. The aim is to see  from an analysis of history  which data are most helpful in predicting the probability of default. Such analysis produces “scorecards” for use in processing loan requests. Increasingly  consumer loans are being managed on a portfolio basis  with banks calculating expected losses for various broad product categories. Some are tracking the migration of loans through various stages of delinquency to help determine the proportion which will ultimately incur a loss. By updating the amounts at each stage  and adjusting migration rates in the light of current information  banks aim to measure more accurately the current risks in their portfolios. At the “bigger” end of the loan market  a lot of attention is being given to the accuracy and timeliness of risk-grading systems. To grade loans  the more sophisticated banks are now using complex statistical models based on financial information about borrowers or on equity prices. These feed into decisions about pricing  provisioning and portfolio balance. Securitisation  the development of secondary markets and the use of credit derivatives are other facets of the more scientific management of credit risk. These trends are  of course  to be encouraged. The new tools should not  however  be regarded as guarantees against unexpected credit problems. For one thing  their usefulness depends critically on the quality and relevance of the historical information which goes into them. Most banks have detailed asset quality data for no more than a few years  covering not even one full credit cycle. Even where good data are available  it is uncertain how closely past relationships will hold for the future. There would be dangers  therefore  if automated systems were used uncritically  without an understanding of their limitations. Even when these models have been extensively road tested and their predictions assessed carefully  it is unlikely that they will do away with the need for overriding judgments about economic prospects and the outlook for particular industries and sectors. On the other hand  the new techniques do provide an objective framework for decisions about pricing and capital allocation. While it would be foolish to rely blindly on them  it would be as dangerous if they were too easily overridden by competitive pressures. As another participant at our Conference asked: will banks be willing to forego business that is apparently priced in line with the prevailing market just because a risk-based model indicates that it would dilute shareholder value? There is no doubt that such questions should be resolved at the highest levels in banks. They should not be left to business-driven relationship managers. BIS Review 71/1997 - 4 - Needless to say  we will be keen observers of banks’ lending practices over the next couple of years. Interbank settlement risk and RTGS Naturally we in the RBA  like almost everyone else  would prefer not to contemplate the failure of a bank. But bank failures have happened from time to time in other countries - despite the best endeavours of managers and regulators. And it would be foolish to turn a blind eye to this possibility in Australia  because a bank failure is not only very damaging for the depositors immediately affected  but it can create a wave of problems flowing well beyond that particular institution. This flow-on damage can occur in various ways  including through effects on depositor confidence  but perhaps the most important channel is the payments system. If a bank in difficulty has large unsettled payment obligations to other banks  those banks will inevitably share some of the pain. There could then be further effects which cannot be predicted with any precision. In the past Australian banks have not paid much attention to interbank settlement risk; indeed  they have had no way of monitoring their exposures to each other during the day. They operated on the presumption that  as long as they exchanged payments only with supervised banks  the central bank would “sort out” a settlement problem in the unlikely event that one arose. This is hardly a sound basis on which to proceed - from either a commercial or a public policy viewpoint. It leaves individual banks potentially exposed to large losses which  because of the broader ramifications  tax payers might end up having to cover. To achieve a more satisfactory position  Australia is now travelling the path of many other countries in introducing a real-time gross settlement - that is  RTGS - system for interbank payments. Under RTGS  high-value payments will be settled continuously across banks’ accounts with the RBA - rather than being accumulated  left hanging overnight and settled up in one hit the following morning. On an average day payments exchanged among banks but not settled until the next day come to over $90 billion. RTGS will  at the outset  eliminate about two-thirds of that overnight exposure. It will also give Australia a fully-fledged delivery-versus- payment system for transactions in debt securities. With banks and other payments providers  the RBA began building the RTGS system in 1995. This has been a major undertaking - with a development cost across the industry of around $120 million. The project is technically complex  but its biggest challenges have been reaching agreement on the architecture and rules for a system which all high-value payments providers will use on an equal and open basis. Progress has not been rapid  or without occasional friction  but it has been steady. The key components of the system are now falling into place: last month  the RBA’s central site - where interbank payments will be processed in real time - became available for testing by the industry; by early next month  this central site will be fully operational; by August  the industry’s system for delivering payments to the central site using SWIFT messages should be tested and ready to use; BIS Review 71/1997 - 5 - over subsequent months  high-value interbank payments will be moved progressively onto the new system  although ultimate settlement will  for the time being  still be the following morning. Full implementation of RTGS is scheduled for April next year. Whether this is achieved now depends largely on the commitment of the industry  especially the major banks. As we get closer to RTGS “going live”  more thought is being given to its practical implications for banks and their customers. Perhaps the most important of these is the daily management of liquidity. With payments able to flow across banks’ settlement accounts at the RBA only if the paying bank has sufficient funds  liquidity will clearly become more of an issue than it is now - when a bank needs only enough funds to extinguish any net obligation to others each morning. Under RTGS  banks will need to manage their liquidity more carefully or run the risk of being unable to send an important payment at the required time. Banks are starting to give attention to this task - studying the patterns in their payment flows and upgrading their systems so they can monitor and manage flows on an aggregate basis across their business. There will inevitably be implications for corporates in this. RTGS will cause banks to focus more sharply on the amount of credit extended to customers during the day. Because they will have to manage their own liquidity more closely on a real-time basis  banks will (understandably) want to control their customer exposures  and the demands which these place on liquidity  more tightly than before. Payment requests will have priorities attached. Corporates may need to negotiate facilities to ensure that time-critical payments will flow when they are expected by suppliers and counterparties. As a result  some will no doubt choose to plan their payments and receipts more actively than in the past. Our impression from recent discussions with corporate treasurers is that very few  if any  banks have yet done much talking to their customers about these issues. More careful management of liquidity by banks and their customers will reduce the likelihood of payments “gridlock” under RTGS. For its part  the RBA has taken various decisions aimed at ensuring adequate liquidity will be available  at a reasonable cost  across the system as a whole. We will enter into securities repurchase agreements with banks to provide them with intra-day funds at virtually no cost. We will allow banks to dip into their PAR assets for such transactions. The range of assets eligible for repos with the RBA has also just been expanded. Finally  as banker to the Commonwealth  we will use our control over government payments to inject funds early in the day. It remains to be seen whether other devices will be needed to lubricate the system. In some places  such as the United Kingdom and Hong Kong  banks are required to send a minimum proportion of their payments early in the day to provide liquidity for the market. We will monitor flows to assess whether such “affirmative action” is necessary in Australia. It will  of course  be essential that most high-value payments are settled real-time when the new system is available. Anything less would defeat the purpose for which it is being built. There have been suggestions that some banks might by-pass RTGS by using lower cost (but higher risk) channels  such as the Direct Entry system which is designed for high volumes BIS Review 71/1997 - 6 - of small payments and settles on a net deferred basis. If this were to happen  we would have to consider what incentives or sanctions were needed to ensure that high-value payments travel along the RTGS path. RTGS will not  of itself  remove the risks that banks incur in international payments - in particular  the risks arising from non-synchronisation of payments and receipts in foreign exchange transactions. Having RTGS for domestic transactions is  however  a necessary step toward tackling this. We’re currently investigating the extent of Australian banks’ settlement risks in their foreign exchange business. This is the next major frontier for risk reduction in banking. Operational risk and Year 2000 As their business becomes more complex and diverse  banks are increasingly reliant on computers for information-processing and control. As a result  they are exposed to various kinds of operational risk. For a bank active in derivatives trading  a breakdown in computer systems for even a relatively short time could be disastrous - preventing it from monitoring its changing market positions and disrupting its capacity to trade and to settle outstanding transactions. I recently heard a keen observer predict that the next big banking disaster would come from a (hypothetical) major international bank losing track of its derivatives positions for 24 hours. To protect against such events  banks invest heavily in the integrity of their computer systems  as well as in back-up and disaster recovery facilities. The RBA is  of course  providing such back-up for the core of the RTGS system. The Year 2000 problem poses a rather novel sort of operational risk because it is the result of past programming decisions which have produced the classic “unintended consequence”. Basically  the risk is computer confusion and malfunction when the year identified in programming as “99” clicks over to “00”. The upshot for Australian banks is the need to spend big sums on replacing or reprogramming their date-dependent computer systems. For the four majors alone  the total cost could be well over $350 million. As the calendar moves forward  the need to get on with addressing this problem becomes more urgent. In the United States  Federal regulators have recommended that financial institutions complete all necessary reprogramming by the end of 1998 to allow time for thorough testing before January 2000. This will be needed because  in changing a lot of banking software  new bugs could be introduced along the way. More aggressive targets have been set for large banks where computer problems could do broad damage to the working of the financial system. The RBA is currently seeking assurance that Australian banks are giving the Year 2000 problem the high priority it warrants. We recently sent them a questionnaire asking each about progress in identifying the size of the problem for its operations  in drawing up a management program to fix it and in assigning the necessary resources. They should also be finding out what their major customers are doing about it. BIS Review 71/1997 - 7 - Fixing the Year 2000 problem is not a glamorous task - but it is no less important for that. In this respect  it is much like the challenge of managing banking risks generally. BIS Review 71/1997

Rivlin  before the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the US House of Representatives on 23/7/97.,Ms. Rivlin reports on the positive perfomance of the US economy and the policies needed to sustain growth in the future Testimony of the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  Ms. Alice M. Rivlin  before the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the US House of Representatives on 23/7/97. I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to the Committee for holding this hearing to solicit a wide range of views on appropriate monetary policy at this extremely favorable moment in our economic history. All too often congressional hearings are called when something bad is happening. In a deteriorating situation  Congress finds it necessary to survey the damage  assess responsibility and call for better policies in the future. At the moment  however  the economy as a whole is functioning amazingly well. Employment is high and rising  unemployment is low  incomes are increasing  profits are high  the Federal budget deficit is plummeting  state and local finances are increasingly strong  and inflation is benign. The overriding economic objective -- shared by all participants in the economy -- is to keep the good news flowing. We all want the economy to grow at its highest sustainable rate  to keep unemployment and inflation low  and above all  to avoid recession as long as possible. Thoughtful people  at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere  have somewhat different views about why the economy is doing so well and how best to keep it going. Your invitation to share those views is timely  constructive and welcome. I would like briefly to discuss three questions: 1. 2. 3. Why is the economy performing so well -- and  in particular  why do we have so little inflation with such low unemployment? Why is it so important  especially right now  to keep the economy growing at its highest sustainable rate and to avoid recession? What policies -- monetary and other economic policies -- are most likely to keep economic performance high and sustained? Why is the economy doing so well? Most economists are frankly surprised that the economy has been able to grow fast enough to push unemployment rates below 5 percent without generating accelerating inflation. Until recently  most students of the economy thought that unemployment rates below 5.5 - 6.0 percent (estimates differed) for an appreciable period would lead to rising labor costs that would be passed on in higher prices and start a self-perpetuating wage-price spiral that would be hard to reverse. True  unemployment had been lower in the 1960s while inflation remained low  but the structure of the economy and the characteristics of the labor force subsequently changed in ways that seemed to make the economy more inflation-prone for given levels of unemployment. The experience of the period since about 1970 appeared to confirm that inflationary pressure emerged at unemployment rates appreciably higher than those of the 1960s. Five years ago  most economists would have thought the Federal Reserve irresponsible and derelict in its duty if it had not used monetary policy to slow an economy operating at such a high level that unemployment remained under 5.5 percent for more than a short time. The inflation might not appear immediately  but it was thought to be inevitable  and allowing it to get up a head of steam before acting was taking a high risk of having to react more strongly  perhaps strongly enough to bring on a recession. Nevertheless  the unemployment rate has been below 5.5 percent for over a year and below 5.0 percent in 1997 while inflation has shown no signs of picking up -- indeed  producer prices BIS Review 72/1997 - 2 - have actually been falling. The Federal Reserve  except for a quarter point tightening of the federal funds rate in March (after months of inaction)  has left the monetary levers alone. Is the Federal Reserve ignoring risks of future inflation? The answer depends on whether the coexistence of higher growth and lower unemployment with benign inflation is explained by a fundamental improvement in the structure of the economy making it less inflation-prone  or by temporary factors that might return to “normal” and kick-off an inflationary wage-price spiral  or by some combination of the two. The honest answer is: We don't know yet. One surprise has been that such tight labor markets have not resulted in more rapid increases in wages and other labor compensation. Part of the explanation  as Chairman Greenspan noted in his testimony on July 22  may lie in less aggressive behavior on the part of workers. Workers may be more reluctant than previously to bargain for higher compensation or to take drastic action  such as striking or quitting to look for a better job. They may be reluctant because they are insecure in the face of rapidly changing technology  for which they fear they may not have the right skills  because they have recent memories of company “downsizing ” or because they are less likely than in previous tight labor markets to be members of a union. These explanations of less aggressive worker behavior are plausible  but likely to be temporary. Workers are not likely to get more insecure as low unemployment continues  and union strength is unlikely to ebb further. Part of the explanation of moderate compensation increases may also lie in more aggressive employer resistance to labor cost increases than in previous cycles. Business owners and managers appear to believe strongly that they are operating in such a competitive environment -- whether domestic or international -- that they cannot pass cost increases on to their customers in higher prices because they would lose those customers to competitors overseas or down the street. Low import prices resulting from growing international competition and the strong dollar reinforce this perception. Domestic markets have also become more fiercely competitive as the result of deregulation  lower transportation and communication costs  and more competitive business attitudes. These competitive forces  well known to workers  may give employers a plausible reason -- or at least an excuse -- for strong resistance to wage and benefit demands. The subdued inflation rate itself  moreover  has dampened inflationary expectations. These lower expectations contribute both to diminished compensation demands of workers and stiffer employer resistance to those demands. An important contribution to lower total compensation costs has also come from the slowdown in the rise of health benefit costs associated with the shift to managed care and the general reduction in the rate of health care inflation. It is not yet clear how much of this slowdown is temporary. The other surprise is that prices have shown no reaction to the moderate compensation increases that have occurred. Increased foreign and domestic competitiveness is certainly part of the answer  but the remarkable fact is that this competition has not generally eroded profit margins. Persistent high profits suggest that  on the average  employers have been able to increase productivity enough to absorb larger compensation increases without comparable price increases. Whether they will be able to continue to do so is the crucial unanswered question facing monetary policy makers at the moment. Measured productivity has grown slowly for more than two decades and did not accelerate in this expansion as economists hoped it would. Nevertheless  output per hour seems to have picked up a little recently  which is surprising late in an expansion when productivity increase normally slows. If productivity growth were on the verge of sustained acceleration  a possibility discussed in Chairman Greenspan's testimony  it would greatly increase the chances of higher sustained growth without accelerating inflation. There are reasons to be optimistic  but only time will tell if the optimists are right. BIS Review 72/1997 Why is sustained growth so important now? - 3 - It is always desirable to live in an economy that is growing at a healthy rate. The general standard of living rises and average people are normally better off. Not only do private resources grow  giving consumers more and better choices  but public resources also grow  making it easier to solve public problems and improve national and community infrastructure. Healthy growth has to be sustainable  not bought at the price of environmental degradation or inflationary overheating that turns a boom into a bust. Nevertheless  there are at least three reasons why it seems especially important for the United States in the next few years to do everything possible to keep the economy growing at a healthy sustainable rate and avoid recession. Welfare reform Recent legislation requires extremely ambitious state and Federal efforts to reduce dependency and channel large portions of the present and future welfare population into self- supporting jobs. For these efforts to be even moderately successful will require effective skill training and job placement  adequate child care and  above all  low unemployment rates and plentiful entry level jobs. If economic expansion continues and labor markets remain tight  there is a good chance that many families who would otherwise have depended on welfare can acquire the job skills and experience that can enable them to live more independent and satisfying lives. If the economy slides into recession before welfare recipients have time to establish new skills  work patterns and eligibility for unemployment benefits  welfare reform is almost certain to be a failure  if not an outright disaster. Community development Partnerships for community development are beginning to create new hope for some devastated areas of big cities  smaller towns and rural areas. Partners include business and community groups  financial institutions and governments. With continued economic growth and low unemployment  these efforts could transform many blighted areas into viable communities with decent housing and an economic base. Recession  especially a deep one  would dry up public and private resources and greatly reduce the chances of successful community development. Preparing for more older people Perhaps the biggest challenge to the U.S. economy (indeed to all industrial economies) over the next couple of decades is the prospective rise in the ratio of elderly to working age people. Barring a huge increase in working age immigrants or dramatic increases in the length of working life  the number of retirees will rise much faster than the working population beginning early in the next century. No matter what combination of public and private pensions are used to sort out the claims of retirees to a share of the nation's output  the only way to guarantee a rising standard of living for both retirees and workers is to greatly increase the future productivity of that workforce. A high growth economy over the next decade could generate enough saving and investment to make that increased future workforce productivity feasible. Slower growth and repeated recessions could make the burden of an aging population far heavier and policy choices more contentious. What policies are needed? These three challenges to the American economy simply reinforce the need to keep the economy on the highest sustainable growth track attainable and to keep recessions as shallow and infrequent as possible. The biggest problem for monetary policy at the moment is that no one knows what growth rate is sustainable. It may be true that the structure of the economy has changed in ways BIS Review 72/1997 - 4 - that make a higher growth rate sustainable without inflation than we thought possible a few years ago -- or it may not be true. The question turns on whether productivity growth has shifted up out of the doldrums of the last couple of decades. It's possible that it has  but by no means certain. This leaves monetary policymakers with the difficult job of watching all the signs  weighing the risks and making a new judgment call every few weeks. At the moment  there seems to be little risk of the economy slowing down too much in the near term and sliding into recession. Growth has already slowed from its clearly unsustainable pace in the first quarter  but all the current signs point to continued economic expansion for the rest of this year and into the next. The risks seem higher on the other side -- that many of the factors holding down inflationary pressures will prove temporary  that the rebound of productivity necessary for higher sustainable growth will not occur or not prove robust and durable. The Federal Open Market Committee has to weigh the risk of slowing the economy unnecessarily against the risk of waiting too long and having to put the brakes on harder later. Waiting longer may increase the possibility of overheating followed by recession. It's a tough call. I can't promise we will make the right decisions  but I can promise we will try. It is important not to overestimate the role of monetary policy and the Federal Reserve. Monetary policy can help keep the economy from falling off the sustainable growth track in either direction -- either by overheating and generating enough inflation to unbalance the economy and threaten growth or by chugging along too slowly with excessive unemployment. But monetary policy cannot do much to determine how high the sustainable growth rate is. How fast the economy can grow is determined by how rapidly the employed labor force is increasing and how fast the productivity of that workforce is growing. There are only two ways to get more output: either more people work or working people produce more (or both). In the 1960s and 1970s  the American workforce was growing rapidly as the large baby boom generation reached working age and women  especially mothers  moved into the workforce in much larger proportions than previously. But those two trends have run their course. The labor force is likely to grow slowly over the next few years  about 1 percent per year. The main hope for increasing labor force growth  besides encouraging more immigration  is that continued tight labor markets plus increased flexibility in employment hours will gradually begin to reverse the trends to early retirement that has reduced labor force participation among older people. Continued employment opportunities combined with well-designed training programs  especially in computer related skills  could also attract into the labor force people who are not actively looking for work because they don't think they have the skills to get a “good” job -- principally older workers and young people who have dropped out of school. Indeed  the shortage of workers with modern technical skills may be the biggest problem facing the American economy at the moment  as well as its biggest opportunity. As long as labor markets stay tight  investment in skill training is likely to pay off handsomely both for individuals and for companies that can retain the trained workers long enough to benefit from their increased productivity. Public investment in training for workers with low skills -- often unsuccessful when jobs are scarce -- also stands a far better chance in tight labor markets of moving workers into jobs in which they can gain increasing skills  experience and higher wages. Continued low unemployment rates  plus public and private investment in skill training are essential  not only for successful welfare reform  but also for modernizing the skills of the portion of the workforce whose real incomes and opportunities have declined both relatively and absolutely in the last couple of decades. The other key to productivity increase  of course  is continued investment  both public and private  in research and development and the technology and infrastructure needed for continuous modernization of the economy. Stable low inflation tends to foster long-term planning and investment by businesses and households. A high growth economy should generate more of the saving needed to BIS Review 72/1997 - 5 - finance the investment. Reducing the public dissaving inherent in running a deficit in the Federal budget also adds to national saving. Near term reform of social security and Medicare in ways that add to national saving  public and private  could make a significant contribution to future productivity increase and hence to raising the future rate of sustainable economic growth. In summary  the objective of economic policy -- monetary policy included -- is to keep the economy on the highest sustainable growth path. No one knows exactly what that rate is right now  or what it can be in the future  but a combination of policies  intelligently pursued  can raise it as far as possible. These policies include: wise monetary policy that helps the economy expand  and keeps labor markets tight  without incurring excessive risk of accelerating inflation; investment in skills by individuals  firms and the public and non-profit sectors; increased saving (public and private) invested in research  technology and infrastructure. The Federal Reserve will do its part  in the face of huge uncertainties  to steer an appropriate monetary policy. Fiscal and other policies  both public and private  are needed to take full advantage of the opportunity we have today to keep the American economy operating at a high level in the future.

Rivlin  before the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the US House of Representatives on 29/7/97.,Ms. Rivlin discusses the Federal Reserve’s planning process and the efforts being made to improve performance Testimony of the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  Ms. Alice M. Rivlin  before the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the US House of Representatives on 29/7/97. Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee  I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Federal Reserve’s planning process and the efforts we are making to measure and improve our performance in the spirit of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). I am personally a long-term proponent of GPRA and worked hard on its implementation when I was at the Office of Management and Budget. While the Federal Reserve does not receive appropriated funds and is not  strictly speaking  covered by the Act  we are eager to participate in the processes and activities set forth in the Act. GPRA fits well with the new efforts the Federal Reserve has undertaken to plan further ahead  use our resources more effectively and to coordinate activities across the whole system more explicitly. The testimony is a brief progress report on those efforts. Planning at the Fed In its briefest form  the Federal Reserve’s mission is to “foster the stability  BIS Review 72/1997 - 2 - Reserve have historically been quite decentralized  and major changes have required painstaking consensus building across the Board/Bank structure. The regional structure of the Federal Reserve is one of its great strengths. The twelve regional Federal Banks work closely with the banks in their region and are closely tied into their regional economies. The development of Federal Reserve policy is greatly enriched by the in-depth knowledge that the regional banks have of the industrial  agricultural and financial forces shaping different parts of the economy. The challenge confronting strategic planning at the Federal Reserve is to find a balance between decentralized regional planning  which preserves the strengths of the regional structure  and the need for a more comprehensive national plan aimed at increasing efficiency by rationalizing the allocation of resources across regions and functions. In recent years  major changes have occurred in the allocation of Federal Reserve resources in response to unfolding events. When serious problems developed in the banking industry in the 1980s and in response to increased supervisory responsibility for foreign banking entities  more Federal Reserve resources were channeled into supervision and regulation. Rapidly changing technology  especially telecommunications and automation  has revolutionized Federal Reserve operations and required considerable investment in hardware  software and expertise. Consolidation of the banking industry  evolution of payment systems patterns and technology  growth in derivatives  globalization of financial services  concerns about equal credit opportunity and fair housing issues  efforts to reduce systemic risk in the payments area  and changes in monetary aggregates  have all caused planning and resource adjustments. Rapid technological change has also created opportunities for system-wide efficiencies resulting from consolidation of activities in one or more Reserve Banks. A number of the twelve regional banks have developed specialized activities serving other regions. For example  Federal Reserve Automation Services (FRAS) is headquartered in Richmond  but provides mainframe data processing and data communications services to all parts of the system. This consolidation and specialization has enabled the Reserve Banks to centralize operations of many of their mission critical applications  such as Fedwire  Automated Clearing House (ACH)  and accounting. Continued technological advance  as well as further consolidation in the financial services industry  is likely to lead to further specialization among regional Federal Reserve Banks. New Strategic Planning Activities In the face of accelerating change  the Federal Reserve recently recognized the need for a more comprehensive planning framework. In 1995  a System Strategic Planning Coordinating Group was appointed  consisting of Board members  Reserve Bank Presidents and senior managers  representing the full range of the Federal Reserve’s activities. This group produced an “umbrella” framework  designed to enable the Board  the Reserve Banks and product and support offices to produce their own more detailed plans and decision documents under the “umbrella.” This framework  which is the basis for the document submitted to the House and Senate Banking Committees  sets forth the mission of the Federal Reserve referred to above. It also discusses the “values” of the Federal Reserve  the goals and objectives of the Fed  key assumptions  as well as the external and internal factors that could affect the achievement of those goals and objectives. With the overall framework as a reference point  strategic planning BIS Review 72/1997 - 3 - activities are proceeding with new energy at the Reserve Banks  at the Board  and with respect to cross-cutting major functions such as the payments system and bank supervision and regulation. Individual Reserve Banks have reviewed their operations from the ground up and reassessed their structure and effectiveness in carrying out their missions. Some of the Banks have launched fundamental re-engineering efforts that are resulting in substantial changes in management structure and operations. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago calls its effort “Fresh Look”; the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland is engaged in “Transformation: 2000.” Board planning and budgeting At the Board  we have restructured the annual planning and budget process to put more emphasis on planning (and less on detailed line-item budgeting)  to lengthen the planning and budgeting horizon  and to involve the Board itself more heavily in setting priorities. To this end  we have established a Budget Committee of the Board (consisting of myself and Governors Phillips and Kelley) assisted by a staff planning group drawn from across the major functions of the Board. We are working with a four-year planning horizon and intend to produce the Board’s first biennial budget (1998/1999) to go into effect on January 1  1998. Our hope is that the new process and structure will give the Board a better understanding of the options it faces with respect to alternative ways of carrying out the Federal Reserve’s mission  and a clearer basis for deciding on priorities. Payments System study A major study of the Federal Reserve’s role in the Payments System  currently underway  is another example of strategic planning with respect to a major portion of the Federal Reserve’s activities  under the general umbrella of the strategic planning framework. Since payments technology and the structure of the financial services industry are changing rapidly  it seemed important to focus both on how the payment system was evolving (and should evolve) and what role the Federal Reserve should play in that evolution. The United States is amazingly dependent on paper checks -- Americans wrote 64 billion checks in 1996 -- while most of the industrial world is shifting rapidly to more efficient electronic based payments. The study  directed by a committee of two Governors and two Federal Reserve Bank Presidents  has drawn on analytic resources across the Federal Reserve System and outside. We began by examining the consequences of substantially altering the role of the Federal Reserve in the retail payments system (checks and wire transfer system know as ACH). We analyzed the impact of scenarios ranging from withdrawal of the Federal Reserve from the check and ACH markets to more aggressive leadership by the Federal Reserve in making the payment system more efficient and less dependent on paper. To get maximum input from the participants in the payment system -- banks  clearinghouses  vendors  consumers and others -- in helping us assess alternatives for the future  we held a series of “forums” around the country in May and June. We had enthusiastic and extremely helpful participation from a wide range of institutions. We learned a lot from the process and are now reassessing the alternatives  conducting additional analyses and preparing to present preliminary options to the Board. I look forward to sharing the study with this Committee. BIS Review 72/1997 - 4 - The payments area is a good example of the dilemma posed for planners by rapid technological change. While rapidly evolving technology makes focussing on future options imperative  it also makes it extremely important to remain flexible. Laying out a blueprint for the payments system of the next ten or even five years  and rigidly following it  would almost certainly be a mistake. The technology is moving so rapidly that investments made now may well be obsolete in a short time. Performance Measures A major theme of GPRA is the identification of specific measures of performance of projects and programs which can be used to evaluate their effectiveness. As in most organizations  performance measurement at the Federal Reserve is more advanced -- and more feasible -- in some types of activities than in others. In the payment services areas  the Reserve Banks have measured their performance through various financial measures for many years. For example  the Monetary Control Act of 1980 imposes market discipline on the Federal Reserve by requiring it fully to cover its costs of providing services to depository institutions  and compliance with this requirement is monitored closely. Frequently private competitors provide or could provide these services  and our ability to recover our costs  adjusted to include a factor for imputed profits  taxes and cost of capital  help determine whether it is beneficial for the economy that we stay in the business. In addition  the Federal Reserve has traditionally measured unit costs for its financial services and has developed various indices that allow a Reserve Bank to measure its cost performance over time and in comparison to other Reserve Banks. Private sector benchmarks are also being developed. The Federal Reserve also tracks quality measures for many Reserve Bank services. Finally  the Federal Reserve monitors the progress of the Reserve Banks against various strategic objectives. Similarly  in bank supervision  the Federal Reserve has long used a variety of measures of the effectiveness of its examination process  but the measurement challenge has taken on new importance as supervision becomes more automated and more focused on analyzing risk. To meet this challenge  the Federal Reserve is working closely with other regulators to standardize and improve examination techniques  and has established a Steering Committee to oversee implementation of a risk-focused examination program and to design a management information system that will permit the Board to evaluate better the efficient use of examination resources among the Reserve Banks. For instance  supervisory data are used to determine in advance of on-site examinations what factors (CAMELS rating  asset size  location  and loan types) are most predictive as to the resources needed for examinations  and which institutions  particular lending areas or other service lines may require more intensive review. Such programs are low-cost because they use information that we already collect  and are effective and cost-saving because they provide a systematic way to plan and prioritize our time and resources. In other areas  such as the research and statistical analysis on which monetary policy is based  performance measurement is -- and will remain -- far more problematic. The performance of the economy itself is not so hard to measure and right now is highly positive. But it is not clear how much of the economic progress can be attributed to monetary policy  and even less clear how particular monetary policy actions are related to the quality and quantity of research and analysis produced by the Fed’s research staff. BIS Review 72/1997 Conclusion - 5 - GPRA provides the opportunity for a major improvement in the management and effectiveness of Federal agencies. It provides the impetus for agencies to clarify their missions and objectives  measure their performance better and improve their efficiency and effectiveness. It must  however  avoid the risk of becoming  like some previous efforts to improve government management  largely a paper exercise which produces many numbers and reports but few real results. The Federal Reserve welcomes the opportunity to participate in the GPRA process. We will work hard to fulfill the vision of the framers of the Act and avoid the pitfalls. We will have to respond in ways that are appropriate to the Federal Reserve’s diverse missions and decentralized structure. I believe we have made significant progress toward the GPRA-type strategic planning and are on the track to making more in the immediate future. BIS Review 72/1997
r970806c,1997-08-06,https://www.bis.org/review/r970806c.pdf,Mr. Meyer gives his views on the conduct of monetary policy in the United States (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  23 Jul 97),Testimony by Mr. Laurence H. Meyer  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  before the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the US House of Representatives in Washington DC on 23/7/97.,Ms. Phillips' testimony before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the U.S. House of Representatives Testimony of a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  Ms. Susan M. Phillips in Washington  on 8/10/97. Madam Chairwoman and members of the Subcommittee  I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Federal Reserve’s efforts in recent years to strengthen its supervisory processes and also to share with you the Board’s views about what challenges lie ahead  both for the banking system and the supervisory process. As you know  the U.S. economy and its banking system have enjoyed half a decade of improving strength in which U.S. banks have become better capitalized and more profitable than they have been in generations. Moreover  in the past 13 months not a single insured bank has failed  and the Bank Insurance Fund is now capitalized at a level requiring most banks to pay only nominal fees for their insurance. While we can take comfort and  to some degree  satisfaction in these events  experience has demonstrated that at times like these -- if we are not vigilant -- risks can occur that set the stage for future problems. As I begin my remarks  I would like to point out that no system of supervision or regulation can provide total assurance that banking problems will not occur or that banks will not fail. Nor should it. Our goal as regulators is to identify weak banking practices early so that small or emerging problems can be addressed before they become large and costly -- either to the insurance fund or the financial system as a whole. We believe that progress made in recent years to focus our examinations on the areas of highest risk at banking organizations places us in a better position to identify problems early  control systemic risk  and maintain financial stability. That goal and the need to adapt the supervisory process to the potentially rapidly changing conditions in banking and financial markets underlies our decision to pursue a more risk-focused supervisory approach. We are well underway in implementing this new supervisory framework  and initial indications about that process from both the Federal Reserve’s supervisory staff and the banking industry  itself  have been favorable. The risk-focused approach reflects our supervisory response to the effects that technology and financial innovation have had on the pace of change in banking organizations  the nature of U.S. and world financial markets  and the techniques employed for managing and controlling risk. As banking practices and markets continue to evolve  our emphasis on risk-focused supervision will be even more necessary in the years to come. The Federal Reserve’s Oversight Role As the primary federal supervisor of U.S. bank holding companies  state member banks  and most U.S. offices of foreign banks  the Federal Reserve has sought to apply effective supervision and contain excessive risks to the federal safety net  while also ensuring that banks adequately serve their communities and accommodate economic growth. As the nation’s central bank  the Federal Reserve brings a different  important perspective to the supervisory process through its attention to the broad and long-term consequences of supervisory actions on the financial system and the economy. Significantly  the practical  hands-on involvement which the Federal Reserve gains through its supervisory function supports and complements our other central bank responsibilities  including fostering a safe and efficient payment system and ensuring the stability of the financial system. Past studies of bank failures have cited a number of contributing factors including  but certainly not limited to  inadequate supervisory staffing and antiquated examination procedures. Over the years  as it has supervised and regulated banking organizations  the Federal Reserve has emphasized periodic  on-site examinations that entail substantive loan portfolio reviews and significant transaction testing to identify emerging problems. In that connection  the Federal Reserve has sought to maintain a sufficient number and quality of supervisory personnel to conduct BIS Review 93/1997 - 2 - examinations with appropriate frequency and depth. That approach appears to have provided us with some consistent success. As conditions within the industry have substantially improved  the Board has been mindful of the cost of conducting its supervisory activities and has worked to contain those costs in the face of increased responsibilities. Throughout this period we have recognized the need to maintain stability in our work force  and have sought to avoid excessive build-ups or periods of disruptive retrenchment. That approach has enabled us to maintain what we believe has been an adequate and consistent level of oversight of banking organizations under our supervision during both good times and bad. Developments Driving Change During the past decade  the U.S. banking system has experienced a great deal of turmoil  stress  and change. Ten years ago  many of the country’s largest banks announced huge loan loss provisions  beginning the process of reducing the industry’s overhang of doubtful developing country loans. At the same time  many of these institutions and smaller regional banks were struggling with oil and agriculture sector difficulties or accumulating commercial real estate problems. These and other difficulties took a heavy toll. By the end of the 1980s  more than 200 banks were failing annually  and there were more than 1 000 other problem banks. This experience provided important lessons and forced supervisors and bankers  alike  to reconsider the way they approached their jobs. For their part  bankers recognized the need to build their capital and reserves  strengthen their internal controls  and improve practices for identifying  underwriting and managing risk. Supervisors were also reminded of the need to remain vigilant and of the high costs that bank failures can bring  not only to the insurance fund but to local communities as well. The FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 emphasized that point  requiring frequent examinations and prompt regulatory actions when serious problems emerge. Beyond these largely domestic  institutional events  banks and businesses throughout the world were dealing in the 1980s and 1990s with new technologies that were leading to a multitude of new and increasingly complex financial products that changed the nature of banking and financial markets. These technologies have brought many benefits that facilitate more efficient markets and  in turn  greater international trade and economic growth. They may also  however  have raised macro-stability concerns by concentrating the growing volume and complexity of certain activities within a small number of truly global institutions. It is essential that these largest firms adequately manage the related risks of these activities and that they remain adequately supervised. For it is these institutions that have the potential to disrupt worldwide payment systems and contribute most to systemic risk. In addition to the formal supervisory oversight exerted by regulators  concerns may be eased somewhat by the strong counterparty discipline being brought to bear world wide on banks and other financial institutions dealing in these new products. The scrutiny among counterparties in the global market place has contributed to improvements in capital positions and in overall risk management practices. In many ways  U.S. banks have been in the vanguard in applying technological advances to their products  distribution systems  and management processes  with such applications and innovations as ATMs  home banking  securitizations and credit derivatives. Such efforts  combined with greater attention to pricing their services and measuring their risks  have had material effects on the increased strength and profitability that our banks have seen. Within the United States  our banking system has also experienced a dramatic consolidation in the number of banking institutions  with the number of independent commercial BIS Review 93/1997 banking organizations declining from 12 400 in 1980 to 7 400 in June of this year.1 That structural change has also contributed to industry earnings by providing banks with greater opportunities to reduce costs. The challenge going forward for many of these institutions may be in managing the growth and the continuing process of industry consolidation. This challenge may be greatest as banking organizations expand  particularly through acquisitions  into more diverse or nontraditional banking activities. That growth into a wider array of activities is especially important if banks are to meet the wide-ranging needs of their business and household customers while competing effectively with other regulated and unregulated firms. However  the managerial implications of rapid growth and growth into new activities should not be overlooked  either by the institutions or their supervisors. Supervisory Challenges Ahead There is also no shortage of tasks facing the Federal Reserve as a bank supervisor  despite the virtually unprecedented strong condition of the U.S. banking system today. We  too  must deal with the evolving financial markets and advances in technology. At the same time  we must ensure that our own supervisory practices  tools  and standards take advantage of technological improvements and financial techniques so that our oversight is not only effective  but also as unobtrusive and appropriate as possible. These tasks are wide ranging  extending from our own re-engineering of the supervisory process to the way supervisors approach issues such as measuring capital adequacy and how we seek convergence on bank supervisory standards worldwide. Risk-focused examinations Constructing a sound supervisory process while minimizing regulatory burden has been a long-standing and on-going effort at the Federal Reserve and an objective we have sought to advance with our emphasis on risk-focused examinations. Particularly in the past decade  we have found that the increased range of products and the greater depth and liquidity of financial markets permit banking organizations to change their risk profiles more rapidly than ever before. That possibility requires that we strike an appropriate balance between evaluating the condition of an institution at a point in time and evaluating the soundness of the bank’s processes for managing risk. Recognition of the need for that balance is at the heart of the risk-focused examination approach. The risk-focused approach  by definition  entails a more formal risk assessment planning phase that identifies those areas and activities that warrant the most extensive review. This pre-planning process is supported by technology  for example  to download certain information about a bank’s loan portfolio to our own computer systems and target areas of the portfolio for review. Once on-site  examiners analyze the bank’s loans and other assets to ascertain the organization’s current condition  and also to evaluate its internal control process and its own ability to identify and resolve problems. As a result  the Federal Reserve is placing greater reliance than before on a bank’s internal auditors and on the accuracy and adequacy of its information systems. The review of the information flow extends from top to bottom  and with the expectation that bank senior management and boards of directors are actively involved in monitoring the bank’s activities and providing sufficient guidance regarding risk assumption. 1 “Independent commercial banking organizations” is defined as the sum of all bank holding companies and independent banks. Multi-bank holding companies are  therefore  considered as a single organization. BIS Review 93/1997 - 4 - As in the past  performance of substantive checks on the reliability of a bank’s controls remains today a cornerstone of the examination process  albeit in a more automated and advanced form. For example  automated loan sampling is performed for the purpose of generating statistically valid conclusions about the accuracy of a bank’s internal loan review process. To the extent we can validate the integrity of a bank’s internal controls more efficiently  we can place more confidence in them at an earlier stage and can also take greater comfort that management is getting an accurate indication of the bank’s condition. Toward that end  Board staff is working to refine loan-sampling procedures that should further boost examiner productivity and accomplish other supervisory goals. Moreover  as examiners are able to complete loan reviews more quickly  they will have more time to review other high-priority aspects of the institution’s operations. A significant benefit of the risk-focused approach is its emphasis on ensuring that the bank’s internal oversight processes are sound and that communication between the bank and senior examiners is ongoing between examinations. That approach is generally supported by institutions we supervise and provides a more comprehensive oversight process that complements our annual or 18-month examinations. Such an approach strengthens our ability to respond promptly if conditions deteriorate. Another benefit of the risk-focused approach has been a greater amount of planning  analysis  and information gathering at Reserve Banks prior to the on-site portion of the examination. Far from reducing our hands-on knowledge of the institution  this approach has ensured that when we are on-site  we are reviewing and analyzing the right areas  talking to the right people and making better use of our time and that of the bank’s management and employees. In addition to improving productivity  it has also reduced our travel costs and improved employee morale. Examination staff at the Reserve Banks indicate that this process may be reducing on-site examination time by 15-30 percent in many cases and overall examination time of Federal Reserve personnel by perhaps 10 percent. While those results are tentative  partial  and unscientific  they are certainly encouraging in terms of resource implications. Complementing the risk-focused approach to supervision are enhancements to the tools we use to grade a bank’s condition and management. Since 1995  we have asked Federal Reserve examiners to provide a specific supervisory rating for a bank’s risk management process. More recently  the CAMEL rating system  too  has been revised by the banking agencies to place more emphasis on the adequacy of a bank’s risk management practices and was expanded to include a specific “S” rating for an institution’s sensitivity to market risk. As you may know  the Federal Reserve has also  for some time  used a rating scheme that focuses heavily on managerial procedures and controls in its oversight of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. How effective is the risk-focused process? Since economic and industry conditions have been generally favorable for the past several years  there has not been a sufficiently stressful economic downturn to test fully bank risk management systems or supervisory practices. The market volatility beginning in 1994 did  however  provide some tests for the risk management systems of the larger banks with active trading desks. Nevertheless  there are many indications that bank and supervisory practices are materially better than they were in the 1980s and early 1990s. For example  the risk-focused approach is helping to identify certain deficiencies before they show up in a bank’s financial condition. These are evidenced by instances where ratings for the quality of bank management are lower than those for capital  asset quality  or earnings. Because managerial weaknesses eventually show up in a bank’s financial condition  it is important to identify and resolve those weaknesses early. In that regard  the risk-focused approach endeavors to prevent problems from developing to the point that they cause unnecessary losses that impair the institution’s capital and require resolution under the Prompt Corrective Action mandate. BIS Review 93/1997 One example of how the risk-focused approach is helping to identify and address deficiencies is our supervisory experience with the U.S. branches of foreign banks. Subsequent to the enactment of the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act of 1991  which gave the Federal Reserve greater supervisory authority over foreign branches  our examinations uncovered a number of entities with internal control and audit weaknesses. This result was not completely unexpected  as these foreign banking organizations were not previously subject to the same level of oversight as our domestic organizations. Recognizing the seriousness of these weaknesses and their potential for causing problems in the future  the Federal Reserve has taken a number of steps to ensure that practices are materially upgraded at foreign branches and that any weaknesses continue to be uncovered. In addition to identifying and addressing internal control and audit weaknesses through examinations and supervisory follow-up  these efforts include ensuring that the foreign bank provides the necessary managerial support to its U.S. branches  including adequate systems of controls and audit. To place even more emphasis on internal controls and audit systems  the foreign branch rating system was revised in 1994. Furthermore  in 1996 additional steps were taken to ensure that internal control weaknesses are corrected and will not cause financial harm by adopting requirements for audit procedures in situations where significant control weaknesses are detected. These efforts to detect problems at their early stages and resolve them appear to be having positive effects. After peaking in 1993  there has been a steady decline in the number of U.S. branches and agencies with an overall examination rating of fair or lower and a rating of fair or lower in an examination component substantively affected by internal control and audit weaknesses. We believe that our continued efforts in this area will lead to further improvements in the internal control and audit practices of foreign banking organizations Implementing the risk-focused approach has not been an easy task. It has required a significant revision of our broad and specialized training programs  including expansion of capital markets  information technology  and global trading activities  as well as courses devoted exclusively to internal controls. These education programs will  of course  need to be continually updated as industry activities and conditions evolve. With the greater discretion provided to examiners to focus on areas of highest risk  ensuring the consistency and quality of examinations has increased in importance. Fortunately  new training courses and improved examination platforms  tools  and programs that guide examiners through the appropriate selection of examination procedures will help. In addition  our ability to evaluate more thoroughly the quality of an examination has improved with the greater depth of analysis provided in supporting examination materials such as the written risk assessments and analysis of exam findings. Those materials are allowing us to perform comparative reviews of examinations across institutions of similar size  risk profile and complexity  to ensure quality and consistency. So far we have been able to evaluate the effectiveness of our examination programs by identifying whether problems are identified early and resolved in a timely fashion  by evaluating whether examination reports and findings provide clear feedback to management and identify areas of highest risk  and by monitoring the extent to which our examinations are complying with statutory mandates for the frequency of examinations. Based on those criteria  I believe our examination program has been generally successful. Application of technology to supervisory process BIS Review 93/1997 - 6 - The Federal Reserve has also done much to increase its own use of technology in an effort to improve examiner productivity  enhance analyses  and reduce burden on banks. Much of this effort has been conducted on an inter-agency basis  particularly in cooperation with the FDIC and state banking departments with whom we share supervision of state-chartered banks. Specific results include the development of a personal computer  lap-top workstation that provides examiners with a decision tree framework to assist them through the necessary procedures. The workstation also helps them document their work and prepare exam reports more efficiently. In addition  a software program has also been developed for receiving and analyzing loan portfolio data transmitted electronically from financial institutions. This process not only saves time but also improves the examiner’s understanding of the risks presented by individual portfolios. The Federal Reserve is also developing an electronic examination tool for large domestic and foreign banking organizations that enhances our ability to share examination analysis and findings and other pertinent supervisory information among our Reserve Banks and with other supervisory authorities. This platform should substantively improve our ability to provide comprehensive oversight to those firms that are most prominent in the payment system and global financial markets. In addition to examination tools  the Federal Reserve has for many years maintained a comprehensive source of banking structure  financial  and examination data in its National Information Center. By year-end  we will have completed significant enhancements to the tools that provide examiners and analysts at the federal and state banking agencies with access to those data. The Year 2000 One of the clearest reminders that managing technology is a challenge of its own is the need for banks to resolve the “Year 2000” problem. U.S. banks appear to be taking this matter seriously and are generally well underway toward identifying their individual needs and developing action plans. The Federal Reserve and the other federal bank supervisors are reviewing the relevant efforts of every insured depository institution in order to determine whether adequate progress on this issue is being made. This process should be complete by the middle of next year so that any detected deficiencies may be addressed in time. Meeting the demands of this review and ensuring proper remedies both before and after the year 2000 will be a significant and costly task to both the industry and the banking agencies. However  even within the context of banking  the scope of the Year 2000 problem extends far beyond U.S. banks to foreign banks  bank borrowers  depositors  vendors  and other counterparties. Through the Bank for International Settlements and other international forums  the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking agencies have emphasized the need for all institutions to recognize this issue and to address it actively. Importantly  century date compliance is gaining more attention internationally  and the Basle Supervisors Committee is taking steps to address this matter. Banks and others need to address year 2000 system alterations  not only because of the potential effects on overall markets  but also as a threat to individual firm viability. At a minimum  banks should be concerned about their ability to provide uninterrupted service to their customers into the next millennium. If nothing else  it is simply good business. Efforts to Accommodate Industry Growth and Innovation Another goal of the Federal Reserve’s supervisory approach is to remove unnecessary barriers that might hinder the industry’s ability to grow  innovate  and remain competitive. Recently  the Board refined its application process to ensure that well-run  well capitalized banking organizations may apply to acquire banks and nonbanks in a more streamlined fashion and BIS Review 93/1997 commence certain types of new activities without prior approval. The Board also significantly revised various rules for section 20 companies and scaled back or removed many redundant firewalls. While these refinements require some changes to the supervisory process  we firmly believe that removing barriers to these lower risk activities is essential to maintaining the industry’s health and competitiveness and its ability to serve its customers and the community. Supervising nationwide and international institutions The consolidation and transformation of the U.S. banking system resulting from evolving market  statutory  and regulatory changes are also requiring the Federal Reserve to adapt to new conditions. As previously noted  we are working closely with the FDIC and state banking agencies to deal with the challenges presented by interstate banking and branching to ensure that the dual banking system remains viable in future years. To address that goal  the FDIC  the Federal Reserve  and the state banking departments began on October 1 a common risk-focused process for the examination of state-chartered community banks. Another initiative has been the State/Federal Supervisory Protocol  which commits the various banking agencies to work toward a “seamless” and minimally burdensome oversight process. In short  it sets forth a process in which state banking supervisors will accept the supervisory reports of other agencies for banks operating in their states through branches  but headquartered elsewhere. The fact that the plan has been accepted by all involved parties is encouraging. We now need to ensure that it is implemented as intended  as banks make use of their broader branching powers. Similar coordination efforts are necessary and underway in an international context. Through the Bank for International Settlements  for example  the Federal Reserve and the other U.S. banking agencies participate with supervisors from other G-10 countries to develop not only prudential capital and other regulatory standards  but also to promote sound practices over a broad range of banking issues. In this regard  the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision  with the approval of the central bank Governors of the G-10 countries  recently issued three documents: one dealing with the management of interest rate risk by banks  one dealing with the Year 2000 problems  and another identifying 25 “core principles” of effective supervision that is directed at bank supervisors worldwide. The Basle Committee is also working to improve international risk disclosure practices of banks  and has created the new market risk capital standard that is based on banks’ internal value-at-risk models. That standard goes into effect in January of next year. Beyond the work of the Basle Committee and the banking agencies  we are also meeting with the SEC and international securities and insurance regulators to identify common issues  and to bring about greater convergence in our respective regulatory frameworks. That effort also has links to the Committee’s efforts and should prove helpful in strengthening the oversight and regulation of financial institutions throughout the world that provide a broad range of financial products. Successful groundwork from this effort could also have implications for moving forward domestically in an era of financial reform. Guidance as well as supervisory and regulatory standards such as these -- whether developed in a domestic or international context -- are soon incorporated into examination procedures and help examiners in their reviews of many of the more complex activities of global banking organizations. These global institutions are perhaps the most challenging to supervise. Since it is not feasible for supervisors to review all locations of a global banking organization  emphasis is placed on the integrity of risk management and internal control systems  coordination with international supervisors  strong capital standards  and improved disclosures. BIS Review 93/1997 - 8 - Staffing the Supervisory Process A final supervisory challenge relates to the Federal Reserve’s need to continue attracting  training  and retaining expert staff. Retaining sufficient numbers of individuals with the expertise to evaluate fully the risks in a rapidly changing banking industry is a major priority for the Federal Reserve and figures prominently in the bank supervision function’s strategic plan. Particularly challenging is attracting and retaining specialists in the areas of capital markets and information technology where we have experienced increased turnover. We will continue efforts to attract and retain both specialists and generalists who are qualified to address issues as the industry evolves. As I have outlined in my testimony  the Federal Reserve’s supervisory strategy is to maintain staff who can adequately evaluate the general soundness of banking activities by placing strong emphasis on the bank’s management processes  systems  and controls. I believe such an approach will serve us well as the industry continues to evolve either by expanding the scope of its activities or legislation. Nevertheless  developing the supervisory techniques  and attracting and training the personnel to do the job will pose a continuing challenge in the years ahead. through broader structural changes from financial modernization Conclusion The history of banking and of bank supervision shows a long and rather close relationship between the health of the banking system and the economy  a connection reflecting the role of banks in the credit intermediation process. We can expect that relationship to continue and for bank earnings and asset quality to fluctuate as economic conditions change. As supervisors  we must prepare for such developments. In many ways  however  the banking and financial system have changed dramatically in the past decade both in terms of structure and diversity of activities. Risk management practices have also advanced  helped by technological and financial innovations. I believe that both bank supervisors and the banking industry have learned important lessons from the experience of the past ten years specifically about the need to actively monitor  manage and control risks. Nevertheless  conditions can always change  and the risk-focused approach will be continually challenged to anticipate and avoid new kinds of problems. We must recognize that a risk-focused approach to supervision is a developing process and however successful it may be  there will again be bank failures. Indeed  having no bank failures may suggest inadequate risk-taking by banks and less economic growth. Through our supervisory process  the Federal Reserve seeks to maintain the proper balance -- permitting banks maximum freedom  while still protecting the safety net and maintaining financial stability. Devoting adequate attention to banking practices and conditions and responding promptly as events unfold is the key. We intend to do that now and in the years ahead. BIS Review 93/1997
r970806d,1997-08-06,https://www.bis.org/review/r970806d.pdf,Mr. Kelley describes the Federal Reserve System's efforts to address the Year 2000 computer systems problem (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  30 Jul 97),Testimony by Mr. Edward W. Kelley  Jr. before the Subcommittee on Financial Services and Technology of the Committee on Banking  Housing and Urban Affairs of the US Senate in Washington DC on 30/7/97.,Mr. Kelley describes the Federal Reserve System's efforts to address the Year 2000 computer systems problem Testimony by Mr. Edward W. Kelley  Jr. before the Subcommittee on Financial Services and Technology of the Committee on Banking  Housing and Urban Affairs of the US Senate in Washington DC on 30/7/97. I am pleased to appear before the Subcommittee today to discuss the Federal Reserve’s efforts to address the Year 2000 computer systems problem. I will discuss what action is being taken by the Federal Reserve System to address internal systems  our supervisory efforts  coordination with the industry  and contingency planning. Year 2000 Readiness It is crucial that the Federal Reserve maintain reliable services to the nation’s banking system and financial markets. I want to assure you that the Federal Reserve is giving the Year 2000 its highest priority  commensurate with our goal of maintaining the stability of the nation’s financial markets and payments systems  preserving public confidence  and supporting reliable government operations. The Federal Reserve System has developed and is executing a comprehensive plan to ensure its own Year 2000 readiness and the bank supervision function is well along in a cooperative  interagency effort  to promote early remediation and testing by the industry. The supervision function is completing an assessment of the industry’s readiness  will examine every bank subject to our jurisdiction by mid-1998  and will review their progress as part of all examinations conducted throughout the remaining months before the millennium. We are taking a comprehensive approach to preparedness which includes assessments of readiness  remediation  testing  and updating proven plans and techniques used during other times of operational stress in order to be prepared to address potential century data change difficulties. All Federal Reserve computer program changes  as well as system and user-acceptance testing  are scheduled to be completed by year-end 1998. Further  critical financial services systems that interface with customers will be Year 2000 ready by mid-1998  permitting approximately 18 months for customer testing. Many top personnel in the Federal Reserve System are working hard to manage this initiative. Our staff is putting in many extra hours to prepare for testing with customers  planning for business continuity in the event of any unanticipated internal systems problem  and enhancing our ability to respond to possible operating failures of depository institutions. While there are challenges before us  I can report that we expect to be fully prepared for the century date change. Federal Reserve Readiness The Federal Reserve recognized the potential problem with two-digit date fields more than five years ago when we began consolidating our mainframe data processing operations. Our new centralized mission-critical applications  such as Fedwire funds transfer  book-entry securities  and Automated Clearing House  were designed from inception with Year 2000 compliance in mind. The mainframe consolidation effort also necessitated extensive application standardization  which required us to complete a comprehensive inventory of our mainframe applications  a necessary first step to effective remediation. Like our counterparts in the private sector  the Federal Reserve System still faces substantial challenges in achieving Year 2000 readiness. These challenges include managing a highly complex project involving multiple interfaces with others  ensuring the readiness of vendor components  ensuring the readiness of applications  testing  and establishing contingency plans. We are also faced with labor market pressures that call for creative measures to retain staff who are critical to the success of our Year 2000 activities. BIS Review74 /1997 - 2 - According to industry experts  one quarter of an organization’s Year 2000 compliance efforts are devoted to project management. Managing preparations for the century date change is particularly resource-intensive given the number of automated systems to be addressed  systems interrelationships and interdependencies  interfaces with external data sources and customers  and testing requirements. In addition  Year 2000 preparations must address computerized environmental systems such as power  heating and cooling  voice communications  elevators  and vaults. In the case of the Federal Reserve  management of this project is particularly challenging in that it requires coordination among Reserve Banks  the Board of Governors  government agencies  numerous vendors and service providers  and approximately 13 000 customers. In late 1995  a Federal Reserve System-wide project was initiated  referred to as the Century Date Change (CDC) project  to coordinate the efforts of the Reserve Banks  Federal Reserve Automation Services (FRAS) -- the Reserve Banks’ centralized mainframe data processing and data communications services organization -- and the Board of Governors. Our project team is taking a three-part approach to achieve its objectives  focusing on planning  readiness  and communication. Our planning began with a careful inventory of all applications and establishment of schedules and support mechanisms to ensure that readiness objectives are met. The readiness process involves performing risk assessments  modifying automated systems  and testing internally and with depository institutions  service providers  and government agencies. Finally  we are stressing effective  consistent  and timely communication  both internal and external  to promote awareness and commitment at all levels of our own organization and the financial services industry  more generally. Some of our most senior executives are leading the project and the Board is now receiving formal status reports at least every 60 days. Any significant compliance issues will be reported to the Board immediately. A significant challenge in meeting our Year 2000 readiness objectives is our reliance on commercial hardware and software products and services. Much of our information processing and communications infrastructure is comprised of hardware and software products from third-party vendors. Additionally  the Federal Reserve utilizes commercial application software products and services for certain administrative functions and other operations. As a result  we must coordinate with numerous vendors and manufacturers to ensure that all of our hardware  software  and services are Year 2000 ready. In many cases  compliance will require upgrading  or even replacing  equipment and software. We have completed an initial inventory of vendor components used in our mainframe and distributed computing environments  and vendor coordination and system change are progressing well. As we continue to assess our systems for Year 2000 readiness  we are preparing a central environment for testing our payment system applications. We are establishing isolated mainframe data processing environments to be used for internal testing of all system components as well as for testing with depository institutions and other government agencies. These environments will enable testing for high-risk dates such as year-end 1999  beginning of year 2000  and February 29  2000 (leap year). Testing will be conducted through a combination of future-dating our computer systems to verify the readiness of our infrastructure  and testing critical future dates within interfaces to other institutions. Our test environments will be available to our customers for testing on a twenty-four hour basis  six days a week. Network communications components will also be tested and certified in a special test lab environment at FRAS. The testing effort for Year 2000 readiness within the Federal Reserve will be extensive and complex. Industry experts estimate that testing for readiness will consume about half of total Year 2000 project resources. To leverage existing resources and processes  we are modelling our Year 2000 testing  both internally and with depository institutions  on proven testing methods and processes. Our customers are already familiar with these processes and testing environment. We will finalize and distribute our testing strategy to depository institutions by the end of September this year and begin coordinating test schedules January 1998. As I noted earlier  the Reserve Banks are targeting June 1998 to commence testing with their customers  which allows an 18-month time period for depository institutions to test their systems with the Federal Reserve. - 3 - The next challenge I would like to discuss regards retaining staff critical to the success of the project. As I mentioned earlier  we have placed a high priority on our CDC project  and as such have allocated many of the best managers and technical staff in the Federal Reserve System to work on the project. The information technology industry is already experiencing market pressures due to the increased demand for technical talent. As the millennium draws closer  the global market requirements for qualified personnel will intensify even further. We are responding as necessary to these market-induced pressures by offering incentives to retain staff members in critical  high-demand positions. Our focus at the Board goes beyond the immediate need to prepare our systems and ensure reliable operation of the payments infrastructure. We are also working hard to address the supervisory issues raised by Year 2000 and are developing contingency plans which I will discuss later. Supervision Program Banks rely heavily on their automated information processing and telecommunications systems to participate in the global payments system  to exchange information with counterparties and regulatory agencies  and to manage their internal control systems and sophisticated computer equipment. As a bank supervisor  the Federal Reserve has worked actively with the other banking agencies to advise the industry of our concerns  and to develop a thorough understanding of the industry’s readiness. In this regard  the Federal Reserve is closely monitoring Year 2000 preparations and compliance of the institutions we supervise so that we can act aggressively to identify and resolve problems that arise. Early this year  the Federal Reserve and the other regulatory agencies developed a uniform Year 2000 assessment questionnaire to collect and aggregate information on a national basis. We have received over 1000 responses from financial organizations and service providers supervised by the Federal Reserve. Based on these responses and other information  we believe the banking industry’s awareness level has improved substantially during 1997 and is reflected in the intensified project management  planning  budgeting  and renovation efforts that have been initiated. Generally speaking  the nation’s largest banking organizations have done much to address the issues and have devoted significant financial and human resources to preparing for the century date change. Many larger banks are already renovating their operating systems and have commenced testing of their critical applications. Large organizations appear capable of renovating their critical operating systems by year-end 1998  and will have their testing well underway by then. Some of these organizations have recently come to realize that their initial resource and cost estimates to address this project need to be raised  given the magnitude of the tasks to be performed and the growing scarcity of available programming staff with the skills necessary to renovate older systems. Smaller banks  including the US offices of foreign banks and those dependent on a third party to provide their computer services  are generally aware of the issues and are working on the problem; however  their progress is less visible and will be carefully monitored as part of our supervision program. Many of these organizations appear to have underestimated the efforts necessary to ensure that their systems will be compliant. Accordingly  we will direct significant attention to ensure that these banks intensify their efforts to prepare for the Year 2000. We intend to update our assessment periodically in order to maintain a current awareness of the industry’s readiness. Our focus on the industry’s readiness began last year  when the Federal Reserve commenced examining banks’ plans and initiatives for the century date change. Through mid-year 1998 we will continue this program and conduct a thorough Year 2000 preparedness examination of every bank  US branch and agency of a foreign bank  data processing center  and service provider that we supervise. Our examination program includes an extensive review of each institution’s Year 2000 project management plans in order to evaluate their sufficiency  to ensure the direct involvement of senior management and the board of directors  and to monitor their progress against the plan. Our examiners are actively engaged in ensuring that the board of directors and senior management are addressing the issues - 4 - and assembling the necessary resources. Based on the examination results and the findings collected during the current assessment program  we are identifying those institutions that require intensified supervisory attention and establish our priorities for subsequent examinations. Public Awareness We are mindful that extensive communication with the industry and the public is crucial to the success of our efforts. Our public awareness program includes communications related to our testing efforts and our overall concerns about the industry’s readiness. We continue to advise our customers of the Federal Reserve’s plans and time frames for making our software Year 2000 ready. We have inaugurated a Year 2000 newsletter and have just published our first bulletin addressing specific technical issues. We have also established an Internet Web site to provide depository institutions with information regarding the Federal Reserve System’s CDC project. This site can be accessed at the following Internet address: http://www.frbsf.org/fiservices/cdc. the level  To heighten industry’s awareness the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)  issued a policy statement on May 5th entitled “Year 2000 Project Management Awareness ” which updates the supervisory guidance first issued in 1996. The statement emphasizes the regulators’ concerns that inability to provide a compliant hardware and software environment to support the upcoming century date change would expose a bank to inordinate operational  financial  and legal risks. A set of uniform examination procedures accompanying the statement provides guidance for examiners as well as bank management  stressing the need for sponsorship at the highest levels of the organization to effectively manage the remediation process and address any deficiencies that may surface. Bank management must not only be aware of the many Year 2000 problems  but must also be sensitive to the magnitude of the efforts needed to achieve compliance and the consequent budgetary implications. Industry experts maintain that costs to perform Year 2000 renovation tasks will increase as the demand for skilled information technology professionals grows. Accordingly  the interagency policy statement emphasizes the need for bank management to be aggressive in securing sufficient human and computer resources. The statement also encourages banks to be largely completed with their renovation and well into testing of their major applications by year-end 1998 so that any substantive problems can be addressed in 1999. The statement also calls upon banks to consider the Year 2000 risks posed by their borrowers and customers  as banks could be adversely affected by borrowers who are not prepared for Year 2000 processing. Corporate customers who have not considered Year 2000 issues may experience a disruption in business  resulting in financial difficulties that could negatively influence their creditworthiness. Examiners now verify that a bank incorporates a borrower’s Year 2000 preparedness into its underwriting standards  and that loan officers assess the extent of Year 2000 computer problems that may influence a borrower’s ability to repay its loans on a timely basis. On behalf of the FFIEC  the Federal Reserve has developed a Year 2000 information distribution system  including an Internet web site and a toll free Fax Back service (888-882- 0982). The web site provides easy access to policy statements  guidance to examiners  and paths to other Year 2000 web sites available from numerous other sources. The site has been used heavily since its introduction in early May of this year. The FFIEC Year 2000 web site can be accessed at the following Internet address: http://www.ffiec.gov/y2k. The Federal Reserve has also produced a ten-minute video entitled “Year 2000 Executive Awareness” intended for viewing by a bank’s board of directors and senior management. The video presents a summary of the Year 2000 five-phase project management plan outlined in the interagency policy statement. In my introductory remarks on the video  I note that senior bank officials should be directly involved in managing the Year 2000 project to ensure that it is given the appropriate level of - 5 - attention and sufficient resources to address the issue on a timely basis. The video has already been distributed to banks and their service providers  and can be ordered through the Board’s Web site. We are also taking steps to provide this information to foreign bank supervisors. With regard to the international aspects of the Year 2000 issue  US offices of foreign banks pose a unique set of challenges. Based on our assessments  we are concerned that some offices may not have an adequate appreciation of the magnitude and ramifications of the problem  and may not have committed the resources necessary to address the issues effectively. This is a particular concern for foreign bank offices that are dependent on their foreign parent bank for information processing systems. Therefore  we are working through the Bank for International Settlements’ (BIS) committee of bank supervisors composed of many of the international agencies responsible for the foreign banks that operate in the US Through several presentations and the distribution of the interagency statement and the Year 2000 video to the BIS Supervisors Committee  we have sought to elevate foreign bank supervisors’ awareness of the risks posed by the century date change and to solicit their assistance in monitoring the state of overall preparedness of foreign bank parents to ensure that they consider the needs of their US offices. We are also participating in the BIS Group of Computer Experts’ meeting of G-10 and non-G-10 central banks in September which provides a forum to share views on and approaches to dealing with Year 2000 issues and have been active in various private sector forums. The participants will discuss their involvement with raising bank industry awareness  remediation of payment systems  and the readiness of the central banks’ internal systems. Information garnered from this meeting will assist the BIS Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems  as well as the Federal Reserve  in understanding the current state of preparedness of payment systems on a global level. Contingency Planning Because smooth and uninterrupted financial flows are obviously of utmost importance  our main focus is our preparedness and the avoidance of problems. But we know from experience that upon occasion  things can go wrong. Given our unique role as the nation’s central bank  the Federal Reserve has always stressed contingency planning -- for both systemic risks as well as operational failures. In this regard  we regularly conduct exhaustive business resumption tests of our major payment systems that include depository institutions. Moreover  as a result of our experience in responding to problems arising from such diverse events as earthquakes  fires  storms  and power outages  as well as liquidity problems in institutions  we expect to be well positioned to deal with problems in the financial sector that might arise as a result of CDC. We are  of course  developing specific CDC contingency plans to address various operational scenarios. Our existing business resumption plans will be updated to address date-related difficulties that may face the financial industry. We already have arrangements in place to assist financial institutions in the event they are unable to access their own systems. For example  we are able to provide financial institutions with access to Federal Reserve computer terminals on a limited bases for the processing of critical funds transfers. This contingency arrangement has proven highly effective when used from time to time by depository institutions experiencing major hardware/software outages or that have had their operations disrupted due to natural disasters such as the Los Angeles earthquake  hurricane Hugo in the Carolinas  and hurricane Andrew in south Florida. In these cases we worked closely with financial institutions to ensure that adequate supplies of cash were available to the community and also arranged for our operations to function virtually without interruptions for 24 hours a day during the crisis period. We feel the experience gained from such crises will prove very helpful in the event of similar problems triggered by century date change. We are also beginning to formulate responses for augmenting certain functions  such as computer help desk services and off-line funds transfers  to respond to short-term needs for these services. - 6 - Although operational contingency is something that the Federal Reserve is confronted with on a daily basis  preparation for contingencies in the century date change environment does offer some new and significant challenges. For example  in the software application arena  the normal contingency of falling back to a prior release of the software is not a viable option. This underscores the importance of the rigorous assessment and testing to which all applications must be subjected. Beyond reliance on a sound plan and effective execution of the plan  the Federal Reserve is not totally dependent upon any single system for executing payment orders. While we have very sophisticated automated systems in place  such as Fedwire and our Automated Clearing House systems  we also operate paper-based payment systems that offer a set of alternatives in the event of a disruption in a segment of the electronic payment system. Clearly  the Federal Reserve and other bank supervisors expect depository institutions to work diligently and effectively to ensure that automation issues associated with the Year 2000 are resolved fully and in a timely fashion. However  we anticipate that at least a few financial institutions will experience difficulty in completing their Year 2000 preparations in a timely manner  and we are developing plans to address such cases. The Federal Reserve will identify and monitor these organizations closely and work to ensure that senior management and boards of directors are aware of their Year 2000 issues  cost implications  and possible consequences. A bank’s need for adequate preparation for the Year 2000 is regarded as a safety and soundness issue. Where progress is deemed to be substantively less than satisfactory  resulting in excessive risk and a possibly unsafe or unsound condition  we will address the issue in a manner consistent with our long-standing supervisory approach to dealing with other safety and soundness issues. The full range of our supervisory tools and remedies are available  including intensified monitoring  progressively more detailed reporting requirements  presentations to the board of directors  insistence on bank commitments to initiate corrective action  and  ultimately  possible use of enforcement actions as appropriate. We recognize  nonetheless  that despite their best efforts  some depository institutions may experience operating difficulties  either as a result of their own computer problems or those of their customers  counterparties  or others. These problems could be manifested in a number of ways and would not necessarily involve funding shortfalls. Nevertheless  the Federal Reserve is always prepared to provide information to depository institutions on the balances in their accounts with us throughout the day  so that they can identify shortfalls and seek funding in the market. The Federal Reserve will be prepared to lend in appropriate circumstances and with adequate collateral to depository institutions when market sources of funding are not reasonably available. The terms and conditions of such lending may depend upon the circumstances giving rise to the liquidity shortfall. Discussions are also underway with the other federal banking agencies to ensure that we are jointly prepared to address the challenge resulting from serious operating problems. If such operating problems were not correctable within a reasonable time frame  it could necessitate a federal resolution comparable to that used for a bank that has become capital insolvent. Our preparations for possible liquidity difficulties also extend to the foreign bank branches and agencies in the US that may be adversely affected directly by their own computer systems or through difficulties caused by the linkage and dependence on their parent bank. Such circumstances would necessitate coordination with the home country supervisor. Moreover  consistent with current policy  foreign central banks will be expected to provide liquidity support to any foreign banking organizations that experience a funding shortfall. Closing Remarks As I indicated at the outset  the Federal Reserve views its Year 2000 preparations with great seriousness. As such  we have placed a high priority on the remediation of date problems in our systems and the development of action plans that will ensure business continuity for the critical financial - 7 - systems we operate. While we have made significant progress in validating our internal systems and planning for testing with depository institutions and others using Federal Reserve services  we must work to ensure that our efforts remain on schedule and that problems are addressed in a timely fashion. In particular  we will be paying special attention to the testing needs of depository institutions and the financial industry and are prepared to adjust our support for them as required by experience. We believe that we are well-positioned to meet our objectives and will remain vigilant throughout the process. As a bank supervisor  the Federal Reserve will continue to address the industry’s preparedness  monitor progress  and target for special supervisory attention those organizations that are most in need of assistance. Lastly  we will continue to participate in international forums with the expectation that these efforts will help foster an international awareness of Year 2000 issues and provide for the sharing of experiences  ideas  and best practices.

Macfarlane  to the Australian Institute of Company Directors (Western Australia Division) Winter Dinner held in Perth on 12/8/97. 1. Introduction It is a pleasure to be in Perth to address the Western Australian Division of the Institute of Company Directors. It is also fitting that I should be talking about economic growth  since Western Australia has set an example to the rest of Australia by its high growth rate in the 1990s. Some would say this is inevitable  given its resource base  but we have seen internationally that the fastest growth does not coincide with the biggest resource endowments. Enterprise and a willingness to embrace change are also vital ingredients  and here Western Australia has also distinguished itself. In the Reserve Bank we are often drawn into a discussion of economic growth because of claims that we have a “growth ceiling” of 3½ per cent per annum. I do not know where this perceived ceiling came from  and I have on several occasions denied its existence. I will do so again tonight. It has been suggested to me that one of the reasons for this belief is that I have often highlighted the data contained in Table 1 below  particularly when I have been doing my patriotic duty in Table 1: OECD GDP Growth Over the Past Six Years (Average annualised growth) Ireland Australia Norway New Zealand United States United Kingdom Canada Denmark Netherlands Austria Japan Spain Finland Germany Belgium France Italy Sweden Switzerland Real GDP 6.4 3.5 3.5 3.4 2.7 2.4 2.2 2.1 2.0 1.7 1.6 1.5 1.5 1.4 1.3 1.3 0.9 0.9 -0.1 Source: OECD BIS Review 75/1997 - 2 - front of audiences of overseas investors. It shows that over the past six years  that is the period of the current expansion  we have grown at an annual average growth rate of 3.5 per cent. This is very good by the standards of the “high income OECD countries”. Only Ireland has done better  and Norway and New Zealand have grown at about the same rate as we have. These are all much smaller countries than we are (their combined GDP is less than Australia’s). The other thing that stands out from this table is how well the English-speaking countries have done in the nineties; the six English-speaking countries are in the top seven spots. The 3½ per cent per annum contained in this table is there for international comparisons  not as a yardstick for what we can do this year  next year or the year after. For a start  that six-year average of 3½ per cent contains years like the past 12 months where we have achieved only 2.4 per cent  but there are other periods like the year to September 1994 when we managed 5½ per cent. 2. Economic growth over the cycle While we do not have a growth target or growth ceiling  we do have an inflation target. This says that inflation should average somewhere between 2 and 3 per cent over the medium term. That is  when we look back  we should see that it has averaged 2 point something per cent  even if we have been over 3 per cent on some occasions and below 2 per cent on others. This approach is not  as some might think  anti-growth. It is  in fact  pro growth by favouring forward looking management of the business cycle  which will help in achieving a stable platform for long-run growth. The other way of expressing an inflation target is to say that the economy should grow as fast as possible consistent with maintaining low inflation  but no faster. We say no faster because post-war experience in a number of countries has shown us that allowing inflation to rise too much actually harms growth prospects in the longer term. Sustained periods of strong growth have always gone hand in hand with low inflation. Weaker growth occurred in the high inflation era  particularly between the mid-seventies and mid- eighties. We have also emphasised that it is the length of the expansion that is important. Our last two expansions were cut short by inflationary pressures after about six-and-a-half years. It would probably be possible on this occasion to engineer a short-lived boom  characterised by rising output and falling unemployment  but also by increasing inflation  unrealistically high asset values  inflated paper wealth and financial instability - which is  of course  a recipe for a slump thereafter. Recessions may come for some other reasons  but there is no reason to run a high risk of a self-inflicted one. It is important that we take a longer view in order to achieve a longer expansion. The value of the inflation targeting regime is that it forces us to do precisely that. That is why I am confident that  under our present arrangements  we will be able to do all that can be done to foster a long expansion. What does this mean for the next couple of years? That is really a matter of forecasting rather than speed limits. With inflation tamed  and with some slack available  we should be quite capable of growing by 3½ per cent  4 per cent  4½ per cent (or possibly even faster) over the next couple of years without any significant detrimental effect on inflation. None of these figures is a target; they are simply illustrative of the sorts of numbers we might reasonably expect to see after a period of sub-par growth such as 1996. Ideally  as we grow fast enough to take up existing slack  businesses would lift investment rates further  pushing the capacity constraints further back. If  at the same time  we found that labour market arrangements were able to bring new employees onto payrolls without BIS Review 75/1997 - 3 - generalised pressure on wages  we would be able to sustain faster growth for longer. In other words  by having a longer expansion  we would be able to drive unemployment down further. How likely is that outcome? It is hard to say. We do not have a doctrinaire view on what can be achieved. We will evaluate the evidence as it comes in. Critical in that evidence is the course of prices. The main test of what is sustainable on the growth front is the inflation test: is the rate of growth compatible with achieving the 2-3 per cent average for inflation  looking forward as best we can over a year or two? If the answer is yes  then that growth is sustainable  at least at that point in time. To repeat: we do not have a growth ceiling  beyond which the brakes automatically go on. We have an inflation target  appropriately and flexibly defined  which tells us to tighten when our forecast of inflation has it exceeding the target for any sustained period of time  and to ease when the forecast has inflation sustainably below target. Growth per se does not necessarily trigger this response: it is the inflation outlook which is important. In thinking about the inflation outlook  of course  we need to ask ourselves whether the growth which is occurring now and that which is in prospect are likely to put pressure on capacity to such an extent that inflation might rise noticeably. But that is a judgement based on a range of factors  not a mechanical response to the breaching of some arbitrary growth threshold. Another point I would like to make is that at the moment I do not see that monetary policy is placing any constraint on growth. This is as it should be - one of the advantages of an inflation target is that it makes sure monetary policy is eased when the inflation forecast is below the target average. Hence the five easings over the past year. This might help to reassure those people who think that in order to maintain a low average inflation rate  monetary policy has to be kept continuously tight. It does not - monetary policy will be eased as often as it is tightened. Monetary policy has to be no tighter to maintain an average inflation rate of 2½ per cent  than to maintain an average of 5 or 10 per cent. In fact it probably would have to be tighter at the higher figures as it would be fighting against rising inflationary expectations. Another sign that present monetary policy is not restrictive is to look at the effect it is having on the cost and availability of credit. If this was too expensive  we would not see much being used  but that is not the case at present. All forms of credit - business  housing and personal lending - have been growing at somewhere between 8 and 11 per cent over the past year. This does not suggest that the economy as a whole is finance-constrained  although there will always be some individuals or firms that are. Another manifestation of this that may have escaped many people is that we now have lower interest rates out to five years than the United States  which is the usual benchmark for international comparisons. Now this is entirely fit and proper  given the different cyclical positions of the two economies and given our lower inflation. But even so  it would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. Financial markets took it for granted that Australia would always be a high interest country relative to the United States. (International investors put Australia in with a group of countries called the “high yielders”.) I am strongly of the view that these lower interest rates are a substantial benefit for Australian businesses. 3. Economic growth in the long run So far  we have been talking about growth over short time horizons such as a couple of years or so. Over this horizon  growth can vary quite a lot  and monetary policy will have some influence on the outcome. While monetary policy’s major long-term influence will be on the rate of inflation  over shorter periods it can have a significant influence on economic BIS Review 75/1997 - 4 - activity and employment. If it is too tight  it will unnecessarily constrain them  and if it is too loose  it could set up the conditions for an inflationary boom. The relationship between monetary policy and economic growth is thus essentially a short-term or cyclical one. But this is not what a lot of people are interested in. They want to know what is Australia’s long-term growth potential. Is our potential growth rate relatively low like all the standard OECD countries in Table 1? Is it a bit higher? Or  alternatively could it be as high  or nearly as high  as the newly-industrialising countries of Asia? How could it be raised to a higher figure? These are all difficult questions to answer  and I shall only attempt a very cursory one. But before I do that  I want to make an important point - whatever our potential growth rate is  monetary policy will have little to do with it compared with other factors. Monetary policy mainly works by affecting aggregate demand in the economy. Fluctuations in demand are the normal (though not exclusive) source of business cycles. In thinking about long run trends  however  it is the supply structure - the economy’s capacity to produce and how that can be increased - that is crucial. Perhaps I can take the liberty of illustrating this distinction between short and long run with a stylised diagram. An economy could have an average long-term growth rate as shown in the straight line Trend A. Its actual growth will never be a straight line because of the business cycle  so it is likely to look like the wavy line Actual A. If monetary policy was conducted badly  we could end up with a boom and bust given by the dotted line Actual A1. Alternatively  if monetary policy was conducted well  we should expect to have relatively stable conditions  including low inflation; with a bit of luck  we should also get longer lasting expansions and milder recessions. Because a reasonably stable aggregate price level does not prompt the distortions in economic decisions seen with high inflation  trend growth should be a little higher. But while that difference will be worth having  it only adds a little to trend A  and many people would have trouble noticing the difference. GGDDPP: : TTrreennd d aannd d AAccttuuaall 200 LLeevveel l TTrreennd d BB AAccttuuaall TTrreennd d AA AAccttuuaal l AA AAccttuuaal l AA'' 55 1100 YYeaearrss 1155 2200 oof f RReaeal l GGDDPP 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 BIS Review 75/1997 - 5 - Now  people may be unsatisfied with this outcome and say that they would prefer to be on the faster trend growth line given by Trend B  which is perhaps two or three per cent higher than Trend A. This is a reasonable aspiration  but it cannot be achieved by an adjustment to monetary policy. What factors then explain long-run growth? In simple terms  it is explained by the growth of the productive factors in the economy - the growth of the labour force  expansion of the capital stock and growth in productivity of both labour and capital. This is why there is such focus on micro-economic policies to raise efficiency  rather than manipulation of the macro- economic instruments  when people talk about long run growth potential. Again  all that monetary policy can do is to minimise the booms and busts around the higher trend. The only way that the economy can move from Trend A to Trend B is by enacting policies that either increase the growth of the productive factors or increase their productivity. I do not intend to say much about the growth of the labour force  which in the long run is determined by population growth and participation in the workforce. Note  however  that in the short run the economy can grow faster than the labour force constraint would suggest because  if there is enough flexibility  we can move people out of unemployment into employment. The other point that I should register is that I do not think in the long run we will be able to maintain our current low male participation rate. With life expectancy still increasing  we will not be able to continue the luxury of having so many people entering the workforce in their early twenties and leaving in their mid fifties. This is a transitory phase  not a permanent increase in leisure. In thinking about how to ensure that the capital side of the production potential is expanded sufficiently  it is hard to go past the simple idea that investment has to be funded by saving  and we would probably have more if we increased our domestic saving. Of course it could be funded by more foreign saving  but that path tends to be a more unstable one. I have no new ideas on how to increase our savings other than through the familiar methods of making sure that the government does not reduce national savings through chronic budget deficits and by enacting measures to make sure that a higher proportion of retirement incomes are funded out of private savings. The really big issue for long-run growth is how we raise productivity. In simple debate  this is often portrayed as producing the same with less people  either by job shedding or by substituting capital for labour. But any business knows that it is not just manning levels which are important. The flexibility of the workforce in using the capital equipment  the skills which they can bring to bear in response to new demands and opportunities  the capacity of the firm to innovate and improve processes in industrial and service applications  the ability to develop and exploit new technology - these are actually more important ingredients in the long run. Of course  all good firms are trying to do this all the time. In a competitive marketplace  they have to keep up with their competitors or fall by the wayside. In a global marketplace  they increasingly have to move towards international best practice  which itself is always advancing as a result of innovation and adoption of new technology. In the process of matching their competitors  the best firms drive the development of productivity and the rise in living standards. Not all firms nor all industries will succeed in doing this. Some will thrive and others will fail. Some industries will grow  and some industries that we do not even know about BIS Review 75/1997 - 6 - as yet will emerge. The only thing we know is that there will be continuous change  not just here but in all countries  under the constant pressure of competition  new technologies and globalisation. There is no simple secret to success  but part of the answer must be for both firms and for countries to facilitate change  and to adapt to it  not to resist it. The central issue is that all productivity gains involve change. By their nature they involve producing goods and services in different (and better) ways  or in producing different goods and services. Change is a necessary condition for productivity growth. These major changes are going to occur in the private sector among both large and small firms. The adjustment task will be difficult  but they must try to seek out the profitable and growing areas. While the role of government will be important  the Government will not be able to do the adjustment for the private sector. I find it hard to believe that the Government would be better than the private sector at picking the growth areas  so I believe that the Government’s main contribution should be to remove unnecessary obstacles to change  to provide a high quality infrastructure  to encourage saving and to work at lifting and maintaining quality of education. I know this is a difficult message to give to a public which is growing tired of change (not all of it economic). But the alternative of stopping change is really not viable. It has always been the case that the firms and societies that have managed to embrace the challenge of change and seize new opportunities  rather than turning their backs  have been the ones that prospered. It may  of course  be harder for the high income societies like Australia than for the newcomers who feel less attachment to established ideas and who therefore have less to “lose” in embracing change. But we surely have the capacity to adopt change when we see the need. We have to be convinced it is worth it. The advantages of flexibility have been well demonstrated in the nineties by the superior performance  both in terms of growth and in lower levels of unemployment  of the less regulated English-speaking countries compared to the corporatist European ones. I am not suggesting we should remove all regulation and rely totally on laissez faire. There is clearly a large role for government  but we should always ask whether particular government initiatives are forward looking  or whether they are protecting an existing industry or an existing privilege. The first requirement of government is to provide as stable a macro-economic environment as it can. The second requirement of government is to provide first class  low cost infrastructure. This stretches from such items as the legal system and accountancy standards through to more tangible items like the education system and the utilities  including electricity  gas  water and telecommunications. The Government  of course  need not be the provider of each of these  but it will always ultimately set the standards. Inevitably  governments will also be called upon to enact policies which affect one industry at the expense of others. My only plea here is that they do it in a way that encourages adjustment  perhaps even compensates losers  but not to do it in a way which resists change. 4. Conclusion Australia has recorded quite a respectable growth performance by developed country standards during the current upswing. Even our low point in the mid-cycle growth BIS Review 75/1997 - 7 - pause - a bit over 2 per cent - is pretty good compared with many countries’ average performances. People are disappointed that more progress has not yet been made on reducing unemployment  but we have made some  and further real progress will be made if we can sustain a long running expansion. As I have noted tonight  I think our current monetary policy framework is serving us well in this regard  by requiring us to take a medium-term view in our policy deliberations and maximising the chances for a long recovery. I hope I have helped to explain our thinking. When we shift our focus to the economy’s long run growth prospects  however  monetary policy should inevitably attract less attention. Price stability is a necessary condition for faster long-term growth  but there are many other policies which have to be got right. That’s why it is so hard. If there is a simple message  I think it is that the heart of the long-term growth process is productivity enhancement through innovation  technological change and so on  and that to reap the benefits of those processes  we have to embrace the forces of competition and globalisation  with all the changes and discomforts they bring.

Reddy  at the World Gold Council Conference held in New Delhi on 02/08/97.,Mr. Reddy discusses gold banking in India Address by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India  Dr. Y.V. Reddy  at the World Gold Council Conference held in New Delhi on 02/08/97. I am thankful to the World Gold Council for inviting me to participate in this Conference. It is unusual for the organisers to seek the same speaker and even more unusual for the speaker to accept such an invitation within a span of nine months. That happens in academic circles. It is of course  routine in the Toast Masters Club  of which I was a member decades ago. But  this is a gathering of hard-headed finance and business people. I presume that the organisers felt that I should be called upon to squarely address the issues that I raised in the last meeting  in a somewhat less inconclusive manner this time. Well  it should be possible to address these issues with a little more confidence now  since the last conference has generated pretty well-informed and wide-ranging debate on most of the issues posed. Today  I will briefly recall the issues that I had posed in November last. We could trace policy developments since then. I would also share with you the response we received on the subject  not only from intellectual circles and the media but also through letters addressed to the Government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) - from people in many walks of life. Against this background  and keeping in view the recent developments in economic reform  it is possible to examine the rationale for a New Gold Policy (NGP) at this juncture. The possible objectives and the immediate tasks of an NGP need our attention. If some changes in policy towards NGP are considered necessary  the role of the RBI  banks  government and industry/trade would have to be redefined and re-oriented. I will elaborate on the re-orientation. In my normal style  I will conclude with a set of issues. Deliberately  I am avoiding going into details of gold banking since these aspects will be elaborated by Mrs. Usha Thorat  who is one of our resident experts on gold in the RBI. Issues: A Recall The issues raised in the last meeting related to demand  supply and use of gold. On the demand side  the need for and the effectiveness of restricting demand were the main concerns. On the supply side  limits to domestic production and the implications of import through various channels were touched upon. The fiscal dimensions  trade policy implications  balance of payments (BOP) impact and the desirability of restricting gold import to corporates or banks were also flagged. The role of the RBI in gold policy  sequencing of changes in such a policy and finally the link with capital account convertibility were flagged for further debate. As you are aware  many of these issues have been debated since then  and there has been policy response also. Policy Response: A Summary We have made some progress in liberalising gold policy since we met last. The policy on gold import has been further relaxed and non-resident Indians (NRIs) are allowed to import 10 kgs of gold  against 5 kgs allowed previously. The EXIM policy for 1997-2002 has been modified and now  in addition to the existing canalising agencies  the RBI will be authorising banks to act as nominated agencies for importing gold into the country under various schemes viz.  NRI  SIL and export replenishment/loans  etc. The Tarapore Committee on Capital Account Convertibility has submitted its report and has made wide-ranging recommendations relating to gold  including a more liberal import policy for domestic consumption. The RBI has issued guidelines to banks to apply to it for becoming nominated agencies  and the first set of applications will be considered shortly. In the meantime  the customs have also modified the BIS Review 76/1997 - 2 - procedures for the import of gold - no longer requiring banks to be totally accountable for export obligations of the exporters. The Standing Committee on Gold and Precious Metals in the RBI (Subrahmanyam Committee) has been expanded to include representatives of the Ministries of Finance and Commerce. The Committee is more active now in rendering advice to the RBI and the Government. General Response: A Review The general response to the issues raised in the previous seminar can be described as one dominated by aggressive liberalisers  some advocating caution  only a few favouring no change in the existing policy and virtually none seeking total roll-back of the policy. There has been no mention of the mobilisation of idle gold for productive purposes or the establishment of a Gold Bank to raise resources. (i) Let me summarise the arguments of aggressive liberalisers. - The gold industry  employing goldsmiths numbering about five lakhs  involving an annual turnover of about Rs.25 000 crore  is kept out of any serious consideration in the current reform process. This reflects continuation of a gold-control mindset and the identification of all import  sale or use of gold with black money. Consequently  gold industry exporters of jewellery and genuine purchasers of gold jewellery continue to suffer. - On account of the present policy  the purchaser of gold jewellery pays a higher price of about Rs.3 000 crore every year because of the “hawala” premium  etc. In percentage terms  at wholesale level  it is an extra 17 per cent. Also  because of lack of consumer protection  and improper certification of quality  the purchaser loses about Rs.4 000 crore each year. - The present gold policy shows anti-rural bias. The real purchaser of gold is typically a peasant. Close to seventy per cent of gold jewellery is sold in rural areas and most of gold sales are by way of jewellery. To quote Professor Jeffrey A. Franks  “holding gold has in fact often in history served  from France to India  as the only way the peasant can protect himself against inflation and the vicissitudes of politics”. - Similarly  there is a gender bias  since most of the jewellery is sought by women. While macho consumer durable components are imported and their production or even consumption financed  a non-depreciating asset like gold is discriminated against. It makes no sense to constrain the demand for “a multi-purpose indestructible asset” like gold or gold jewellery  which is a lifetime asset  a hedge against inflation  a source of liquidity and a preferred form of saving. - From a fiscal point of view  the NRI route generated about Rs.500 crore towards customs in a year. The “officialising” of gold import by liberal import of gold will give Rs.250 crore per annum more towards customs  with duties at the same rate as for NRIs. Further  if gold is imported freely under OGL  gold trade down the line becomes traceable and will provide sales tax to State Governments and octroi to local bodies. - From a trade policy point of view  the existing restrictions on gold jewellery-producing units like EOUs constrain the participants in the export market and hamper export growth. Free import under OGL and free export are pre-conditions for capturing world markets - as is evident from the Turkish experience. BIS Review 76/1997 - 3 - - Some advocate free import of gold or import under OGL on the ground that there may be a fall in reserves and a desirable impact on the exchange rate. However  most argue that there will be only “officialising” of gold import and use of foreign exchange under hawala  resulting in no net loss of reserves. In fact  once gold jewellery exports pick up  consequent upon gold-import liberalisation  there will be a positive impact on the trade balance. - There is no way of getting rid of or at least drastically reducing the hawala market in foreign exchange  so harmful to the social and moral fabric of India  unless gold import is freed and the scope for gold smuggling reduced. - As pointed out by the Committee on Capital Account Convertibility  a pre-condition for further reforms in the external sector is free import of gold. - Finally  while bank credit is available for import  domestic production or processing and easy acquisition or consumption of luxury goods  no such bank credit is available for gold and gold jewellery employing half a million and providing first-rate security for banks. In fact  the only way of penetrating the informal credit sector without generating non-performing assets is encouraging the flow of bank credit against gold and silver without reference to end- use. (ii) The cautious liberalisers avoid the subject of liberal bank credit or regulating the gold market altogether  but concentrate on possible balance of payments impact. Hence  they advocate limited import through designated agencies to meet both exporters and domestic industry. (iii) The no-changers feel that the existing import regime is foreign exchange neutral; and existing policy is a reluctant admission of our incapacity to change the mindset of Indians who are wasting their savings on gold. There is no need to assist or develop this “unproductive” sector or activity. (iv) There is little support for a total roll-back of policy. There was  however  a suggestion in the context of an analysis of the Report on Capital Account Convertibility in the Economic and Political Weekly (EPW  June 1997). This article reiterated the possible impact of liberalisation of gold import on domestic savings in an adverse way; on diversion of productive resources into unproductive channels; on aiding the process of tax-evasion and hoarding of incomes and assets. Having expressed this  the article states  and I quote  “a more viable policy from the point of healthy and egalitarian development was to recommend the banning of gold imports (other than for jewellery exports and for industrial use)  and strict enforcement measures against smuggling”. Rationale for New Gold Policy Now Responses to the issues raised by me last year thus show a distinct preference for an NGP. It is possible to highlight the important reasons for a re-look at the existing gold policy. Firstly  it is argued that import or use of gold should be discouraged since it affects domestic savings adversely and implies diversion of resources for unproductive purposes. In reality  our household savings  unlike government savings  have been increasing since independence  while gold was  in spite of the policy  being imported  traded and used. The diversion of savings to unproductive purposes did not happen in the household sector. Further  the idea of mobilisation of resources for productive purposes as defined by planners has yielded BIS Review 76/1997 - 4 - place to a slightly different form of policy management of disposition of resources under the post-reform era. Now  even depreciating luxury goods are produced and traded in our economy. Why discriminate against gold? Secondly  it is also held that we should not waste scarce foreign exchange on unproductive purposes. With current account convertibility and a market-determined exchange rate  it is not appropriate to place a premium on foreign exchange. Further  the recent liberalisation of imports through the NRI and SIL route has shown that  in reality  there is no adverse impact of a liberalised gold import. In fact  this recent experience should provide reason enough for a review now  with a view to liberalising further. Thirdly  it is felt that gold is an important instrument for black money deals and hence restrictions on gold amount to restrictions on black money. Since gold is not the only instrument of black money deals  making gold availability difficult will not deter either generation of black money  or its disposition in many ways  including illegal gold. In any case  with the reduction of income tax rates and the launch of the Voluntary Disclosure Scheme in the current year  the fiscal stance is clear - remove incentives for generating black money. Hence  gold policy as an important instrument of anti-black money policy loses its significance  in view of the recent Budget. Fourthly  international experience  especially with Turkey  where conditions are similar  has shown that liberal imports and organised trade in gold benefits the economy  including the external sector. Also  our neighbours in the SAARC region have liberalised and officialised gold imports at nominal duties. These developments make it imperative that we review our policies urgently. Finally  gold plays an important role in our external trade (next only to oil) and in the domestic economy. The reform process would be incomplete without a review and update of the gold policy. Objectives and Tasks of a New Gold Policy What should be the possible objectives of an NGP? The review of our policy so far and the rationale for an NGP that we considered indicate clearly the desirable objectives of an NGP. The major objectives should perhaps be to: - recognise the importance of gold in the Indian economic system and enable gold to play a transparent and positive role in the industrial development  employment and export sectors of the economy  - ensure orderly development of a gold-related industry in India in terms of physical standards and consumer protection  - create and nurture appropriate official regulatory framework and self-regulatory trade bodies  - exploit the scope for generating revenues to the central  state and local governments  - align the regulatory framework and institutional capabilities in the financial sector - especially banking sector - to enable the above  including gold banking  and - enable fuller integration of gold with other areas of the domestic economy and closer integration with the world gold economy  consistent with our economic reform policies. BIS Review 76/1997 - 5 - If we accept the above objectives of an NGP  four broad sets of measures may need our attention now. These are (i) gold and trade policy (ii) regulation and development of domestic trading  including quality markup (iii) bank financing for import  export and domestic activities and (iv) gold banking. First  on gold and trade policy  the broad thrust has to be liberalisation of import and export  but there are many options in this regard  and these need to be debated. First  place gold under OGL. This would be an ideal situation for free trade and freely tradeable good. However  as an immediate measure  some scepticism could be expressed. Gold has some characteristics of currency  a financial asset and has quasi-foreign exchange attributes. However  free import by members of the organised bullion market or designated agencies should serve the purpose  with some scope for regulation. Import of gold through designated agencies including banks would help regulate the gold market  besides assuring the quality of gold and bringing more transparency in prices. The advantage of restricting import of gold to designated agencies is that the regulators can fix monetary limits on import during the transition. The domestic transactions of gold imported through the designated agencies could be more easily tracked and would be channelled for making jewellery for domestic use or export. This would also boost exports substantially. On this logic  it will be necessary to discourage liberalised import through NRIs. However  it is possible to charge less import duty when designated agencies import  to discourage the NRI route. In any case  nominal import duty is a pre-condition for liberalised imports. Incidentally  under the liberalised regime  the sale of gold by designated agencies has to be freely permitted to domestic jewellery units. Also  the stipulation of payment of duty in foreign exchange may have to be dispensed with in view of the avoidable irritants  the undermining of domestic currency and market-determined exchange rate. Second  impetus to active domestic trading in gold is a logical consequence of an NGP. Currently  the industry is fragmented. It will be essential to tackle major operational issues required to give a fillip to the gold market  such as the development of refining capacity  accredition of refineries and the introduction of the system of hallmarking as a consumer protection and export promotion measure. Further  serial number  fineness and assay mark of the melter and assayer should be found stamped on bars. We may have to allow foreign companies with expertise in this area to set up shop in India. The melters and refiners  both from within and outside India may have to be permitted based on net worth  turnover  etc. Perhaps we have a lot of catching up to do. Third  it may be necessary to recognise financing as an important policy component of developing the gold market. As would be explained later  the legal and institutional framework is available. Finally  the development of gold banking will be derived from the policy stance. On this subject  I expect the deliberations in this conference to throw up some ideas. The Role of the Reserve Bank of India Central banks the world over have a special concern and role in gold economy. The RBI is no exception. Broadly speaking  the role of the RBI spans five areas. First  and very obvious  is the management of gold reserves. Since October 1990  the Bank’s gold holdings have been valued on the basis of international market prices. We recognise the price risk on the gold holdings and have considered the use of gold options and futures to hedge our risk. However  the RBI Act in its present form does not have enabling BIS Review 76/1997 - 6 - provisions. There is also a view that exemption notification by the Government would be required under Section 27 of the Forward Contracts (Regulations) Act to enable the RBI to enter into gold - currency swaps. Second  the RBI had played an active part in the local bullion market. The RBI had  in the past  close links with Bullion Market Association  and the RBI’s nominee was a member. In the 1970s  gold sale was organised domestically by the RBI  even as it continued its interest in the study of gold and precious metals  monitoring prices  trade  etc.  and constantly advised the Government on policies. The RBI in future under the NGP  could play a role similar to the Bank of England in the bullion market. Third  the licensing of import of gold and silver bullion was for a long time a function of the RBI and not of the Import Trade Control. It was only through the amendment to the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act  1973 in 1992 that the import of gold/silver and the export of gold  jewellery and precious stones ceased to be regulated by the RBI. Now  policy with regard to the import and export of gold is under the purview of EXIM policy. However  as per the recent EXIM Policy  the RBI can designate an agency to import gold for selling it to exporters only. Fourth  in terms of Section 6 of the Banking Regulation Act  1949  in addition to the business of banking  a banking company may engage in the buying  selling and dealing in bullion and specie. In fact  the Act allows banks to trade in bullion. Banks extend credit against gold. The regulatory role of RBI arises out of its supervisory functions over banks. Fifth  the RBI has and continues to play its rightful role in influencing the gold policy in the country. We have in fact established a framework for ongoing review of policy in gold. We established a Standing Committee on Gold and other Precious Metals in 1992 which has since been enlarged and activated in 1997. The Committee is also addressing issues relating to the development of the gold market and gold based instruments  with providing a significant boost to jewellery export being one of its objectives. We expect this committee to take an active interest in matters relating to gold banking also. The Role of Government I have alluded  earlier today  to the need for an amendment to the RBI Act and also to issuance of notification by the Government under Section 27 of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act  1954. These measures are needed to enable the RBI and banks to enter into derivative contracts in gold. Further  it is not clear whether gold-denominated certificates and other gold-related products would be deemed to be a security in terms of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act. There are also wide-ranging issues related to taxation. In the European Community  transactions in gold are subject to VAT at rates which vary from country to country. In some countries  gold is subject to sales tax as well. In the UK  there is a formal agreement between the Commissioner of Customs and Excise and the London Bullion Market  on matters relating to tax treatment  and no doubt with the support of the Bank of England. The Government’s role is critical in creating an enabling environment  especially through changes in the legal framework. The Role of Trade and Industry In the early part of this century  there existed an active gold market in India - both BIS Review 76/1997 - 7 - physical and financial - and gold options and futures were actively traded in the Bombay Bullion Exchange. It is possible to revive this market now. Futures trading is already active in other commodities like pepper  etc. and perhaps there is no reason for disallowing gold to be traded again  though under an appropriate regulatory framework. The focus of the regulation could be to ensure that trading is undertaken within prudential limits and correlated to risk-taking capacity  to prevent systemic weakness and to induce transparency in trading practices. We could draw lessons from the British experience. The London Bullion Market Association has the formal responsibility for the supervision of its wholesale bullion market. The Bank of England  with assistance from the London Bullion Market Association  has drawn up a Code of Conduct for the market which covers such matters as confidentiality  market ethics  inducement and conflicts of interest. It is the responsibility of the Association to monitor its members’ adherence both in letter and in spirit  and bring any breaches to the central bank’s attention. In addition  the Association has taken over the functions previously performed by the London Gold Market and the London Silver Market in connection with the technical aspects of deliverable material  the rules governing application for inclusion in the list of acceptable Melters and Assayers and the codification of market practices as far as clearing and settlement are concerned. The Role of Banks Currently  the role of commercial banks is limited to investment in gold as an SLR asset and to lend against bullion and specie. As mentioned  banks could play a more active role in financing gold-related activities. As an immediate measure  perhaps banks may be (a) permitted to be designated agencies for import  (b) encouraged to lend against gold or silver jewellery as security up to - say Rs.2 lakh without any stipulation on end-use to help peasants and penetrate the informal credit sector  (c) advised to devise gold acquisition plans  (d) permitted to lend liberally to gold jewellery business  and (e) allowed to draw upon international experience to deal in the gold industry. Issues As you would notice  I have not gone into the details of gold banking. Similarly  on gold policy and capital account convertibility  my distinguished predecessor  friend  philosopher and guide Dr. Tarapore  will address you later. Deliberately  I have not gone into the issue of the current price situation of gold or use of gold as reserves by central banks. I feel that those issues  though of contemporary interest  are not directly relevant. I am thus  left with issues that flow from my presentation today. First: what should be the possible objectives of an NGP? And when should we launch an NGP? Second: is mere liberalisation of import of gold enough of a reform? If not  what are the other measures? Third: who should be the promoter/regulator for gold trade? Fourth: what should be the objectives of regulating gold trade? Fifth: what are the measures that are possible under the existing legal framework? What changes in legal framework are needed to achieve a globally strategic position for India in world gold economy? Sixth: what should be the tax regime  since in many countries the tax regime for gold is somewhat special. Seventh: how soon could the physical facilities  like quality assaying  marking  designs etc. of international standards be established? What will be the role of foreign investment and technology in this BIS Review 76/1997 - 8 - area? Eighth: how should the banks equip themselves to do gold banking - immediately  with the present legal and policy frame - and soon  to exploit the opportunities under a possible NGP? Ninth: and this is critical from the RBI’s point of view - what is expected of the RBI in the context of developing gold banking now  and under a possible NGP? Let me conclude by thanking the audience for patiently listening to me and assuring the organisers that we in the RBI are eagerly looking forward to the benefit of deliberations here.

r970829b,1997-08-29,https://www.bis.org/review/r970829b.pdf,Mr. Reddy reports on the dilemmas of exchange rate management in India (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  15 Aug 97),Inaugural Address by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India  Dr. Y.V. Reddy  at the XIth National Assembly Forex Association of India held in Goa on 15/8/97.,Mr. Reddy reports on the dilemmas of exchange rate management in India Inaugural Address by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India  Dr. Y.V. Reddy  at the XIth National Assembly Forex Association of India held in Goa on 15/8/97. I am thankful to the organisers of the XIth National Assembly of the Forex Association of India for giving me an opportunity to share with you the dilemmas that we face in foreign exchange management. The fifty years since independence have seen significant changes in our exchange rate regime. The exchange rate policy has evolved from the rupee being pegged to the pound sterling until 1975  pegged to an undisclosed currency basket until 1992 and after a year's experience with dual exchange rate system to a market-related system by March 1993. This has helped to bring about flexibility in exchange rate management. A couple of years ago  my predecessor  distinguished Dr. S. S. Tarapore  addressed this Assembly on some of the burning issues of foreign exchange markets. Last year  my colleague  Mrs. Usha Thorat gave an authentic and analytical account of the recent developments in forex markets and on the role of authorised dealers (ADs) in forex markets. Today  I will address the dilemmas that we  as policy makers  face in the conduct of exchange rate policy. International Parity 2. I will briefly  as a backdrop  revisit the four parity conditions  that you are familiar with. First  the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) which links the spot exchange rate and inflation. Secondly  the International Fisher Relation which links interest rates and inflation. Thirdly  the Foreign Exchange Expectations which link forward exchange rates and expected future spot exchange rates. Fourthly  the Interest Rate Parity  which links spot exchange rates  forward exchange rates and interest rates. The four parity relations could be combined in several ways to throw light on the four critical variables that are often used in exchange rate management policies  viz.  the interest rate differential  the inflation differential  the forward discount/premium  and the exchange rate movement. The theories built around the parity relations help us to understand the foreign exchange markets better  but  they rarely give us ready-made solutions to the problems that arise in day-to-day  say  minute-to-minute operations in the exchange markets. 3. What could be the explanation for such a phenomenon? In the real world  expectations cannot be easily subjected to definitive formulae; goods cannot be transferred across countries simultaneously; shipping and other transactions costs can turn out to be much different from the initial conditions; trade and other restrictions often exist  distorting prices. Even in the most efficient markets  ‘ideal’ conditions do not exist  and forward premia as a result have not been able to predict future spot rates accurately. The actual exchange rates are usually overvalued or undervalued in terms of the purchasing power parity. Under Indian conditions  however  there are some additional questions. For instance  which is the correct risk-free interest rate to be compared while calculating interest rate differentials? Should we consider the 91-day T-bill rate or some other short-term rate? The theoretical forward premia could vary depending on the interest rate chosen. In the quest for answers to some questions  dilemmas do arise. Objectives and Purposes of Exchange Rate Management 4. The main objective of India's exchange rate policy is to ensure that economic fundamentals are reflected in the external value of the rupee. Subject to this predominant objective  the conduct of exchange rate policy is guided by three major purposes. BIS Review 76/1997 - 2 - First  to reduce excess volatility in exchange rates  while ensuring that the market correction of overvalued or undervalued exchange rate is orderly and calibrated. Second  to help maintain an adequate level of foreign exchange reserves. Third  to help eliminate market constraints with a view to the development of a healthy foreign exchange market. Let us relate the above approach to the current context. Current Context 5. The elements of continuity  contextual response and change would be present in the conduct of any policy  including the exchange rate policy. In this address  I will be focusing on the contextual response. After all  exchange rate policy will form part of the overall macroeconomic policy and will  therefore  have to be subservient to overall macroeconomic targets. The conduct of exchange rate policy during 1996-97 was primarily guided by market conditions resulting from the contraction in the current account deficit and resurgence of capital inflows. Foreign exchange reserves (including gold) scaled a peak of US$ 26.4 billion by end-March 1997  without sacrificing exchange rate stability. In regard to 1997-98  the exchange rate policy needs to be seen in the context of the Monetary Policy Statement of April 15  1997. The Statement indicates  given the real GDP growth for 1997-98 of 6.0 - 7.0 per cent  the expansion in M3 would be sought to be maintained in the range of 15.0 - 15.5 per cent to keep the inflation rate at around 6.0 per cent. Monetary policy would  in other words  continue to be directed towards maintaining a stable financial environment in relation to price  interest rate and exchange rate. 6. Against these broad parameters  we have to look at the variables that have a bearing on contemporary exchange rate management. Some of the crucial variables at this juncture  apart from price stability and money supply  which are always dominant  are  in my view  the revenue and expenditure position of the Government  the oil pool deficit  the buoyancy in industrial activity  the progress in infrastructure sector  and the developments in trade and capital flows. Besides  leads and lags operate  affecting the market. Moreover  major players in the market influence exchange rate movements and thereby the perceptions about policy. Let me illustrate this point with reference to the oil pool deficit. The IOC has  in the recent past  increasingly resorted to foreign currency borrowing rather than domestic borrowing to finance the deficit  presumably in view of the lower cost and the perceived stability of the rupee. To the extent the IOC resorts to additional overseas borrowing for oil purchases  the demand in the forex market is depressed  leading to pressure on the rupee to appreciate even further. There would be an exactly opposite effect when the IOC starts reducing the exposure to short term borrowing  simultaneously making the cash payment for current purchases  with implications for exchange rate management. External Value of the Rupee 7. The deceleration in export growth during 1996-97 has emerged as an area of policy concern and exchange rate is often blamed for that. The slow down in export growth during 1996-97 could as well be attributed to the decline in world trade coupled with sluggishness in manufacturing goods prices in the global market  variations in cross-currency exchange rates and deceleration in domestic industrial activities. However  we should accept that  beyond a point  real appreciation of a currency can hurt exports. Given the disparate BIS Review 76/1997 - 3 - movements over time of the exchange rates of the domestic currency and the domestic inflation rate relative to important trading partners  the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) is reckoned as one of the most important determinants of the country's external competitiveness. Using the trade based REER (1985=100)  the REER was 61.02 per cent in August 1993 and 65.78 per cent in August 1995  i.e. an appreciation of 7.8 per cent. In August 1995  the volatility in the exchange rate of the rupee started and in the following months  the rupee depreciated and corrected for real appreciation by January 1996 when the REER was 59.32. For most of 1996  the REER remained stable. However  with the sharp appreciation of the US dollar vis-à-vis other major currencies since the last quarter of 1996  the rupee also appreciated in real terms. In August 1996  the trade based REER (1985=100) was 62.26 which rose to 65.41 in April 1997  i.e. an appreciation of around five per cent. Over January 1996  the appreciation in April 1997 was 10.3 per cent. There is considerable discussion as to whether the rupee is overvalued or not. As per the REER  it would certainly appear so  irrespective of the base chosen. The overvaluation has got exacerbated with the sharp appreciation of the US dollar against other major currencies  viz.  the DM and the Yen. The relative “cheapening” of imports may not have resulted in increasing imports and larger current account deficits. This is because imports are relatively less responsive to exchange rate changes and are more sensitive to the level of economic activity. There could be a potential larger current account deficit as industrial activity rebounds - even at the present exchange rates and if oil demand picks up  a correction cannot be ruled out. The optimal size of the external current account deficit  of course  depends upon the degree of openness of the economy. In the Indian context  the ratio of current receipts to GDP of 15 per cent  as at present  could sustain a current account deficit of the order of two per cent of GDP and would still enable a decline in the debt service ratio from the present level of 25 per cent. A current account deficit of two per cent of GDP in conjunction with the domestic savings rate of 25-26 per cent could ensure an investment rate of around 28 per cent which  even with ICOR of around 4.0 should be able to sustain a real GDP growth of seven per cent per annum. Since 1991-92  however  the current account deficit has averaged around only one per cent of GDP. Thus  enlargement of the current account deficit beyond the present level is sustainable. Volatility 8. The Reserve Bank has been intervening in both the spot and forward markets to prevent undue fluctuations. In the context of large capital flows (inflows as well as outflows) within a short period  it may not be possible to prevent movements in the exchange rate away from the fundamentals. Hence  the management of rate fluctuations becomes passive  i.e.  one of preventing undue appreciation in the context of large inflows and providing a supply of dollars in the market to prevent sharp depreciation. But  the correction  if any  has to be gradual and not sudden. Level of Reserves 9. Adequacy of reserves is  as I mentioned  an important consideration. The level of foreign exchange reserves rose to US$ 29.8 billion by August 1  1997 - equivalent to seven months of imports. In the context of the changing interface with the external sector and the importance of the capital account  we have to evaluate reserve adequacy in terms of both conventional indicators and non-conventional norms. The present level of foreign exchange reserves is equivalent to about 30 months of debt service payments and 5.7 months of payments for import and debt service taken together. In the context of mobile capital flows  it may be BIS Review 76/1997 - 4 - useful to assess the level of reserves in terms of the volume of short-term debt which can be covered by reserves. At the end of March 1997  the ratio of short-term debt to the level of reserves amounted to a little over 25 per cent  compared to about 100 per cent for Indonesia  50 per cent for Argentina  and 25 per cent for Malaysia. In fact  the level of reserves exceeds the total stock of short-term debt and portfolio flows which  taken together  constitute little less than 75 per cent of the level of reserves. The present level of external reserves is a source of comfort as it provides a measure of insulation against unforeseen external shocks or shocks created by domestic supply shortages. Besides  it helps to meet the precautionary motive and satisfy the need for liquidity  which in itself instils confidence in the Indian economy among international investors and financial markets. Such confidence has also a bearing on the extent and of course cost of external borrowings. As the economy becomes more open  external shocks need a cushion which reserves alone can provide. The volatility of some of the capital flows needs to be kept in mind. It is true that reserves are not required to meet the transaction motive which is to be taken care of by changes that will naturally occur in the market determined exchange rates. But  in a period of transition  when structural shifts can release strong excess demand or throw up temporary bottlenecks  reserves smoothen the process of change and mitigate pains of adjustment. So  some addition to reserves  in my view  would give additional comfort. Forex Markets 10. Developing exchange markets is another important consideration in exchange rate management. Recently  several measures were initiated to further integrate the Indian forex market with the global financial system. Banks were permitted to fix their own position limits and Aggregate Gap Limits (AGLs) in January 1996. Banks were permitted in October 1996 to provide foreign currency denominated loans to their customers out of the pool of FCNR - B deposits. In order to achieve greater integration between domestic and overseas money markets  authorised dealers (ADs) were permitted in April 1997 to borrow from their overseas offices/correspondents as well as to invest funds in overseas money market instruments up to US $10 million. With a view to imparting flexibility to corporates and improving liquidity in the forward markets for periods beyond six months  ADs were also permitted to book forward cover for exporters and importers on the basis of a declaration of exposure supported by past performance and business projection  provided the total forward contracts outstanding at any point of time did not exceed the average export/import turnover of the last two years. ADs were also allowed to arrange forex-rupee swaps between corporates and run a swap-book within their open positions/gap limits without prior approval of the Reserve Bank. Now  as per the decision taken last week  FIIs are allowed to cover as a first step their debt exposures in the forward market. In order to further facilitate integration between domestic and overseas markets  banks with adequate capital strength may be encouraged to have higher limits for investments in overseas markets. This will help in developing further the forward markets. East Asian Experience: Relevance to India 11. Speaking of correction in external value and of volatility in forex markets  the question that is often asked is “would India go the East Asian way?” In the early stages of BIS Review 76/1997 - 5 - development  East Asian countries adopted a conscious policy of export-led growth stimulated by real depreciation of their currencies. It was only much later  when capital inflows became strong  after 1992  that their currencies appreciated in real terms. The currency overvaluation  declining exports  overheated property markets and the fragile banking system had fuelled intense foreign currency speculation  as the market participants felt that the natural course of the currency was to depreciate. Given the huge short-term borrowings  the fund managers started exiting the economy with the first sign of trouble  leading to a de facto devaluation of the Thai baht. An important point to be noted here is that the currency crises in these countries was managed quite efficiently with the help of reserves which most of these countries had to defend their currencies. Thailand  as also other East Asian economies  despite a large current account deficit  are high-saving economies with good underlying growth rate and strong competitiveness. What are the lessons for India? 12. The recent experience of the emerging economies shows that any currency could come under speculative attack if its exchange rate is out of alignment with fundamentals for a prolonged period of time. Second  once the speculative attack is launched on any currency  the neighbouring currencies are also vulnerable  no matter how sound their policies may be. Third  the overvaluation of a currency acts as a catalyst when there is a run on the currency as all the market players base their action on the information that the currency is due for correction. Presently  compared to March 1993  the appreciation of the Indian rupee in real effective terms is around 14 per cent. The Indian economy does have certain favourable factors in terms of a moderate CAD/GDP ratio  high foreign exchange reserves and a ratio of short-term debt to reserves much lower than that of the East Asian countries. Our inflation rate is also edging downwards. We have a fairly solid banking system despite the NPAs; the number of NBFCs are not that large; and the financial sector is subject to reasonably effective regulation by the RBI. Our financial sector is  therefore  less vulnerable than many of the East Asian economies  notwithstanding the fact that there are corporates operating with unhedged positions. It is unlikely that any turmoil in South East Asian economies would have a direct impact upon the Indian rupee as India’s trade with the five countries of the South East Asian region (Thailand  Indonesia  Malaysia  Philippines and Singapore) constituted only 7.8 per cent in 1996-97. Also  the currencies of this region are more internationally traded  larger number of hedging products are available  and the central banks of several South East Asian economies pool their resources to counter any attack on their currencies. It is possible that the sentiments that govern the interest of investors in these countries are different from the sentiments of investors coming to India. In brief  the experience of these countries should provide some lessons for us in terms of potential risks. Of immediate relevance to us is the impact of their devaluation on export competitiveness if the rupee continues to appreciate. BIS Review 76/1997 Capital Inflow - 6 - 13. Capital inflows constitute a major factor affecting the value of the rupee now. With the resurgence in capital inflows  the net surplus on the capital account more than doubled to about US$ 11 600 million during 1996-97  thereby exceeding the previous peak of US$ 9 695 million touched in 1993-94. Reflecting these developments  surplus conditions prevailed in the foreign exchange market throughout the year. In general  the policy response has taken the form of partial sterilised intervention through open market operations  liberalisation of capital outflows  raising of reserve requirements and deepening of the foreign exchange market by routing increased volumes of transactions through the market. To prevent appreciation of the rupee  and to protect international competitiveness  the Reserve Bank made substantial purchases of US dollars in the market. During 1997  the RBI intervened in the spot and forward markets  both in the outright and swap segments. Outright spot and forward purchases of US dollars during 1996-97 amounted to $7.9 billion and $0.9 billion  respectively. Swap purchases amounted to $2.4 billion. While spot sale of US dollars was marginal  forward and swap sales amounted to $0.3 billion and $3.1 billion  respectively. Thus  net purchases of US dollars during 1996-97 amounted to $7.8 billion. The influx of capital continues during 1997-98. The Reserve Bank has accumulated US$ 3.9 billion of foreign currency assets until August 8  during the current financial year. Total spot and forward purchases and swap sales of US dollars up to end-July 1997  totalled $4.3 billion  $1.1 billion and 0.9 billion  respectively. Thus  net purchases of US dollars by the Reserve Bank of India up to end July  during the financial year 1997-98 amounted to about $4.6 billion. The optimal policy response to capital inflows is very much a function of the anticipated persistence of capital inflows. The design of policy depends upon the expectation of whether the inflow of capital is temporary or is expected to continue. A temporary increase in inflow  perceived as such by the public  which may lead to a temporary real appreciation of the exchange rate  is unlikely to have major effects. Problems  however  arise if the inflow is temporary  but the public expects the inflow to continue. But  in real life  nobody knows with confidence  what is temporary  how temporary it is  and what the public perception is  and indeed how temporary the public perception is! So  let me straightaway go into the instruments. Internationally  a number of instruments have been used to sterilise capital inflows  the chief among them being the sale of government bonds through open market operations. This policy is useful temporarily and if used for long  leads to renewed inflows. We in the Reserve Bank are  however  well equipped with physical stock of government securities. We have been active in the repo market in recent months to manage temporary liquidity conditions. The idea is to realise a fine balance in order to achieve the objectives of sterilisation without putting pressure on yields. Discount policy  which implies restricting the access of banks to central bank credit or raising the cost of refinance  has also been used by countries to sterilise capital inflows. This instrument cannot  however  be used in the current context when there is plenty of liquidity in the money market and there is no borrowing from the central bank. However  this instrument may go against the long-term objectives of monetary and credit policy. Varying the reserve requirements is yet another policy tool. Mobilising Government deposits has served as a variation to absorption of reserves in some countries. Variable deposit requirements in the nature of interest-free deposits with the central bank is BIS Review 76/1997 - 7 - another form of discouraging capital inflows. This measure  while it reduces the need for costly sterilisation through the sale of bonds  may result in misallocation of resources and reduce the facility to borrowers to take advantage of lower international interest rates. We have used the CRR successfully in the past to stem inflows. After the imposition of CRR on incremental NRI deposits there has been some deceleration in the growth of foreign currency deposits during the current financial year. Entering into foreign currency swaps (spot sell - forward buy) is another way of sterilising capital inflows. The foreign currency purchased by banks may be used to finance domestic activities or for investment abroad. Our experience shows that the market is fairly thin and  in such a market  the use of foreign currency swaps for sterilisation only adds volatility to the forward market unless there is a constant swap window. Central banks can employ outright forward exchange transaction  i.e.  buy outright forward instead of spot. This will have the desired effect on the spot rate only if it is not countered by very large spot inflows from participants like FIIs and forward supplies by exporters who wish to take advantage of the increase in premium. Taxing on capital inflows is yet another form of dissuading flows. For foreign investors  it effectively lowers the rate of return on local assets. This instrument also carries the disadvantage of raising the cost of capital. This option was considered at one time  but deferred  considering its disadvantages. Conclusion 14. I have explained the dilemmas  mainly to show that we are committed to the stated objectives  and assert that we are equipped to handle the problems - equipped with the requisite will and skill. However  some believe that we are cautious - whether in allowing the rupee to appreciate or inducing adequate depreciation. Perhaps some explanation would be in order. First  we are going through a process of economic reform. In a democratic federal set-up  going through such economic reform  we require a general mandate on essential complementary policies. Second  we are vulnerable to supply shocks  especially food stock and oil prices. Third  the East Asian countries support each other. The G-10 countries coordinate with each other. The Latin American countries are generally supported by North America. We are not members of any blocks. We have gone through the trauma of a balance-of-payments crisis in the early 1990s and we cannot ignore the threat to economic sovereignty if we take undue risks. Fourth  and most important  price stability is critical to the economy as a whole  to both the poor and exporters. In fact  as our Governor at the Reserve Bank of India  Dr. C. Rangarajan  mentioned in his address at the Annual Presentation Ceremony of the Engineering Export Promotion Council earlier this month  “containment of domestic price increase has the same beneficial effect as the depreciation of the nominal exchange rate. If the nominal exchange rate is stabilised at a certain level by letting the foreign exchange assets of the central bank increase  it may have an adverse effect on the exporters through price increases arising from more than the desired increase in money supply. There can therefore  be no rigid BIS Review 76/1997 - 8 - formula governing exchange rate determination. Monetary authorities need continually to perform a balancing act between ensuring an exchange rate which will be supportive of exports and the need to contain monetary expansion within reasonable limits.” During the current financial year up to August 1  deposits have grown rapidly by 4.1 per cent (3.7 per cent in the corresponding period last year). M3 has grown by 4.4 per cent up to July 18 (3.7 per cent last year). The year-on-year growth in M3 is 16.7 per cent. The positive features during the current year are that interest rates have come down  both in the short and long term  and so has the inflation rate. The area of concern relates to money supply. Any further measures in terms of exchange rate should consider the money supply effect so that the gains already made on the interest rate and inflation fronts are not eroded. This is the critical aspect of the current exchange rate management stance. Finally  the extent  the pace and the manner of correction of the exchange rate will have to be taken in conjunction with money supply  since price stability continues to be the dominant objective of monetary policy. We in the Reserve Bank seek your assistance  advice  cooperation and understanding. For my part  I am happy to announce that henceforth the Reserve Bank will make available weekly data relating to its intervention in the forex market. BIS Review 76/1997

Stals  at the 77th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of the Bank on 26/8/97. Introduction The turbulences in the South African market for foreign exchange from February 1996  and the subsequent destabilisation of the balance of payments  contributed to a weakening of overall economic growth and to an upturn in inflation. The major task for monetary policy over the past year has accordingly been to restore both external equilibrium and domestic financial stability which are important preconditions for sustained investor confidence and economic growth. The process of restoring external economic equilibrium had to begin at home. Many adverse factors converged to contribute to the sudden exchange rate shock of February 1996. Some were of a non-economic nature while others were rooted in macroeconomic developments over the preceding two years. The problems caused by non-economic factors diminished as concern about the finalisation of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa  the delay of local authority elections in certain provinces  and the political composition of the Government of National Unity were fortunately allayed during the course of the past year. Equally important has been the fact that the Minister of Finance  newly appointed in April 1996  has stood the test of the markets with acclaim and soon established himself as an effective leader of the country’s overall financial policy. Many of the disturbing economic problems which emerged last year were addressed by appropriate policy responses  while the private sector has on the whole endured the inevitable painful adjustments with much understanding. During both 1994 and 1995  growth in real domestic expenditure by far outpaced growth in real domestic production. This was clearly not a sustainable situation  and growth in domestic demand had to be curtailed to ensure a better balance in the overall economy. The untenable developments in domestic economic activity created a widening deficit in the current account of the balance of payments which was being financed by an inflow of volatile short-term foreign capital. When these short-term capital inflows switched into outflows after February 1996  however  a downward adjustment in the rate of growth in overall domestic expenditure  and therefore in the growing demand for imports  became imperative. The divergent rates of expansion in domestic production and expenditure  respectively  were also being financed to an increasing extent with domestic bank credit  or simply the creation of additional money. With insufficient domestic saving and a sudden decline in the inflow of foreign capital after February 1996  the pressure to accelerate the creation of more money increased even further. Assessed against this background  an untenable macroeconomic disequilibrium was rapidly being perceived to be developing at the then level of the exchange rate of the rand. Large foreign capital inflows in 1995  as well as the early weeks of 1996  exerted upward pressure on the value of the rand. Within a floating exchange rate regime  the rand appreciated in real terms  despite heavy Reserve Bank intervention to absorb part of the excess supply of foreign exchange. The appreciation of the rand at the time was clearly irreconcilable with South Africa’s otherwise weak position in a very competitive world economic environment. A stronger rand could not be sustained in the long term. Also instructive in this regard is that similar BIS Review 77/1997 - 2 - experiences by other emerging economies over the past year proved that alternative exchange rate systems  based on fixed or managed floating exchange rates  could also not cope with such divergent economic trends. In some of those countries  even more painful economic adjustments were required to restore financial stability than in the case of South Africa. The monetary policy approach adopted by the Reserve Bank under the circumstances was to let market forces take their course  with some short-term intervention by the Bank only to support an orderly process of adjustment. The exchange rate was therefore allowed to take its market-determined run while liquidity was drained from the domestic money market  interest rates were guided in a gradual upward path  and the resultant adverse consequences of the adjustment in real economic activity were accepted as essential to avoid even greater disruption later on. Domestic financial stability had to be restored first and must now be maintained in order to raise the production capacity of the economy to higher levels on a sustainable basis. These developments over the past year again exposed the urgent need for longer-term structural economic reforms. In June 1996  the Government released a Macroeconomic Strategy for Growth  Employment and Redistribution (GEAR). The full implementation of this programme over the next few years will undoubtedly raise the potential of the economy and enable South Africa to meet the vast basic social and economic needs of the people of the country more adequately. It will also provide the economy with better armour to withstand with more vigour similar adverse macroeconomic developments that may recur in future. In retrospect  the economic policies of the past year contributed significantly towards improving equilibrium when emerging imbalances threatened to frustrate the primary objective of achieving sustainable optimum economic growth and development. Recent improvements in the current account of the balance of payments  the firmer exchange rate of the rand  the increased inflow of foreign capital  and the rise in official foreign exchange reserves  provide sufficient evidence to the effect that the serious danger of a collapse in South Africa’s external economic relations a year ago has been successfully averted. Moreover  there are encouraging  although as yet still only tentative  signs  emanating from both the production and the expenditure sides  that the economy recovered slightly during the second quarter of 1997. This preliminary indication is also confirmed by some hopeful signs that the inflationary pressures which arose from the economic imbalances experienced last year are now subsiding. At the same time  however  the overall financial situation still provides reason for concern  particularly in view of the continued high rates of increase in bank credit extension and in broad money supply. For reasons that will be explained in more detail below  the monetary authorities must persist with their vigil against the threat of overall financial instability that can only lead to stagflation in due course. There are many examples in the world today  both among industrial and emerging economies  where this lesson is again being learnt the hard way after years of reluctance to apply appropriate but unpopular short-term disciplinary monetary policies in a timely fashion. The Reserve Bank is not prepared to consider any short-term expediencies and implement monetary policies that will in the long term lead to serious disruption of financial stability. The country just cannot afford unsound monetary policies for short-term gain. Such policies would gradually undermine the value of the rand and lead to an eventual collapse of the financial system  with serious adverse implications also for the level of real economic activity. BIS Review 77/1997 Recent economic developments - 3 - The Reserve Bank’s Annual Economic Report released this morning serves as a background to the following brief summary of major economic developments over the past twelve months: A year of economic consolidation The pattern of developments in real economic activity over the past twelve months can best be described as the outcome of a necessary process of consolidation after three years of positive growth. The rate of expansion in gross domestic product reached a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 31½ per cent in the second half of 1996  but then slowed down to only 1 per cent in the first half of 1997  indicating a lower rate of growth for the full calendar year of 1997 compared with that experienced during any one of the past two years. During the first quarter of 1997  total gross domestic product actually declined by 1 per cent  setting off alarm bells of a pending recession. During the second quarter  however  there was a distinct recovery when overall economic activity again turned to positive growth  equal to an annualised rate of 21½ per cent. With a continued decline in agricultural production during the second quarter and only moderate growth in mining production  total value added by the primary sectors declined by a further 1 per cent. Against this poor performance  however  production in the rest of the economy was back on track with an expansion equal to 31½ per cent on an annualised basis. With growth of 7 per cent in manufacturing  6 per cent in electricity  gas and water  and 41½ per cent in transport and communication  together with positive growth in all the other sub-sectors  the fears of a pending recession must at least for now have been allayed. Gross domestic expenditure  on the other hand  remained fairly depressed. An estimated small decline in total expenditure in the first half of 1997 contributed to the consolidation process of restoring a better balance between total domestic production and effective demand. Further declines in the growth rates of private consumption expenditure and gross domestic fixed investment  coupled with a substantial reduction in total inventories  were partly offset by a continued high level of expansion in general government consumption expenditure  particularly at the level of provincial and local government. During the second quarter of 1997 there was  however  a noticeable recovery in demand when total gross domestic expenditure expanded again by 2 per cent  after having declined by 1 per cent in the first quarter. Small increases from the first to the second quarter in the rates of growth in private consumption expenditure as well as domestic fixed investment were strongly supported by a further rise at an annualised rate of more than 51½ per cent in general government consumption expenditure. Excluding the effect of a substantial reduction in inventories  total domestic expenditure actually increased by 21½ per cent in the second quarter. These disparate movements in real economic aggregates between the first and second quarters of 1997 underline the importance of correctly interpreting short-term indicators of current economic developments. The Reserve Bank will conscientiously analyse all economic information that becomes available over the next few months with the necessary sensitivity to the pressing needs of the country. BIS Review 77/1997 Better equilibrium in the balance of payments - 4 - The salutary effects on the balance of payments of slower growth in total domestic expenditure are clearly reflected in the rapid decline in the deficit of the current account. On a seasonally adjusted and annualised basis  this deficit declined from R13 billion in the second quarter of 1996 to only R3.5 billion in the second quarter of 1997. In unadjusted figures  the negative balance declined from R5.5 billion in the first half of 1996 to R3.0 billion in the second half of last year  and R2.4 billion in the first half of 1997. Both imports and exports of merchandise responded to the depreciation of the rand last year. In the second quarter of 1997  the level of merchandise exports at current prices was 25 per cent higher than in the second quarter of 1996  whereas the value of imports increased by only 11 per cent. This was  however  not all due to the price effect of the depreciation of the rand. Growth in the volume of imports also slowed down as a result of the decline in gross domestic expenditure. In the case of the value of exports  an increase of 25 per cent was already experienced in the year prior to the depreciation  partly as a result of the removal of international sanctions  which no doubt continued to affect exports in 1996 and the first half of 1997. The improvement in the current account was supported by a larger net inflow of funds reflected in the capital account of the balance of payments. The pressure on the exchange rate of the rand  which continued from February to October 1996  subsided again after October  almost as suddenly as it had appeared. During the first three quarters of 1996  the net capital inflow amounted to only R585 million  but this was followed by a net inflow of R3.3 billion in the fourth quarter  and by no less than R16.7 billion in the first half of 1997. After the rand had depreciated by as much as 23.5 per cent in nominal terms between 14 February 1996 and the end of October 1996  it appreciated by 10 per cent over the next five months. From the end of March to the end of July 1997  however  the rand depreciated again by 3.6 per cent to give a net increase of 6.0 per cent in the external value of the currency from November 1996 to the end of July 1997. It should be noted  however  that the average level of the exchange rate of the rand over the first seven months of 1997  compared with its average value over the same period in 1996  showed a depreciation in nominal terms of 8.4 per cent. Although the initial appreciation after October 1996 was accepted as a partial correction of an over-reaction  the Reserve Bank nevertheless  already in November 1996  started to intervene again in the market as a net buyer of foreign exchange. The country’s gross foreign reserves held by the consolidated banking sector indeed increased by R17.2 billion over the past three quarters to reach a level of R31.1 billion at the end of June 1997. This was sufficient to cover about 91½ weeks of imports of goods and services. Currency depreciation as a means to achieve greater international competitiveness only has a chance to succeed in countries where inflation is not sensitive to depreciation. The events of the past year proved once again that in South Africa inflation reacts with a time lag of only about six months to major changes in the exchange rate. The quarter-to-quarter increase in the seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of change in the production price index for imported goods escalated from 6.0 per cent in the first quarter of 1996 to no less than 18.1 per cent in the fourth quarter  before it declined again to 12.4 per cent in the first quarter of 1997. In the second quarter of 1997  that is approximately six months after the turnaround in the trend of the exchange rate in November 1996  the production price index for imported goods actually declined by 10.7 per cent. BIS Review 77/1997 Monetary aggregates slow to respond - 5 - Over the past two years  the Reserve Bank has on various occasions advanced reasons why changes in the M3 money supply may have lost some of its usefulness as a reliable anchor for monetary policy. At this juncture  the Bank regards changes in M3 only as one among several important financial indicators. It no longer bases its monetary policy decisions automatically on any rigid formula linking actual changes in M3 to the predetermined money supply guidelines issued by the Bank at the beginning of each year. In 1996  for example  monetary policy was aimed more directly towards the restoration of external financial stability. More recently  the Bank has become more concerned about the excessive increase in domestic bank credit extension  not only because of its influence on the money supply  but also for other reasons. There has  for example  been growing anxiety about the over-extension of the private sector’s indebtedness relative to disposable income  and the increasing vulnerability of the banking sector to adverse developments in a possibly less favourable future macroeconomic environment. No central bank can  of course  disregard developments in the money supply or in bank credit extension  even if such developments can be explained as temporary distortions caused by major structural economic reforms. Although changes in M3 and its shorter-term components should be interpreted with circumspection in the present South African environment  they cannot be discarded or ignored. The relationship between the money supply and nominal production  or the velocity of circulation of M3  may be changing  but new relationships are being established in the process of transformation. Over the longer term  it remains true that inflation cannot be sustained indefinitely unless it is fuelled by continuous excessive money creation. Throughout 1996  the annual rate of increase in the M3 money supply fluctuated within a narrow range of between 13.6 and 16.1 per cent. By January 1997 it reached a peak of 16.8 per cent  and then declined gradually to 12.7 per cent in June 1997. As a guideline the Reserve Bank currently regards a rate of increase of not more than 10 per cent per year in the M3 money supply as consistent with the prime objective of reducing inflation gradually to a level that will be more in line with the average rate of inflation in the economies of South Africa’s major trading partners. The increase in M3 has now consistently exceeded the rate of growth in the nominal value of gross domestic product for more than three years  with the result that the ratio of the total amount of money in circulation to gross domestic product has risen to 58 per cent  which is the highest level since 1980. A lack of availability of money can therefore hardly be advanced as a reason for the slowdown in real economic activity over the past eighteen months. The relatively high level of the money supply or  inversely  its low level of velocity of circulation  holds a potential danger for future inflation. Although a substantial part of the excess amount of money in circulation may at this stage be confined to the financial sector  possibly contributing to financial asset inflation  the Reserve Bank will have little control over the situation once holders of financial assets decide again to divert their spending to the acquisition of goods and services. Central bank policy must therefore always be forward-looking and attempt to pre-empt the danger of overspending or rising inflation at some future inopportune stage. Total bank credit extended to the private sector likewise continued to increase at a high rate throughout 1996  and fluctuated between a peak of 18.9 per cent in July and a low of BIS Review 77/1997 - 6 - 16.1 per cent in December. During the first six months of 1997  it peaked at 17.4 per cent in April  and then declined only marginally to 16.3 per cent over the twelve months up to June. As in the case of the money supply  the total amount of bank credit outstanding has risen as a percentage of gross domestic product over the past few years. At the end of June 1997  it amounted to 75 per cent of gross domestic product  compared with 67 per cent at the end of 1993. Bank credit is  of course  not only extended for the purpose of financing purchases of goods and services. Indeed  particularly in recent months  a substantial amount of the additional bank credit created may have been linked to the explosive increases in the volume of transactions in the financial markets  particularly in the equity and bond markets. Nevertheless  all forms of bank credit create money  and the initial reason for which money is created is only of limited significance for monetary policy purposes. Once the money has been created  it becomes part of the amorphous pool of the total money supply and  depending on the strength of the multiplier effect  is available to be used a number of times over  and for many purposes other than its first application. Many explanations can be offered for the persistently high rates of increase in bank credit extension and in the money supply  despite the slowdown in real economic activity over the past eighteen months. It could partly be linked to a switching of international trade financing from foreign to domestic sources  or partly to the financing of summer crops in the agricultural sector that are being harvested late this year. It is also known that bank credit extended to local authorities increased by no less than R2.7 billion from 31 December 1996 to 30 June 1997. These explanations  however  do not detract from the need for a curtailment of the excessive rates of increase in these important monetary aggregates at this juncture. In light of the unfavourable experiences of a number of other countries in recent years  ranging from a well-developed country such as Japan to an emerging economy such as Thailand  central bankers elsewhere are increasingly concentrating on restricting the provision of bank credit for investment in financial assets and property. In a bull market  even at high interest rates  borrowers will continue to borrow funds to buy assets that are rapidly appreciating in value; and banks will continue to lend because the value of their collateral is rising. This could easily cause a speculative bubble that  should it burst  can create major difficulties for both lenders and borrowers. In such a situation  it is not unusual for the money supply to continue to rise  in conflict with the objectives of the monetary authorities  and often also in contrast to the slowdown in real economic activity. South Africa is hopefully not yet in such a position. In the implementation of monetary policy more than in anything else  prevention is almost without exception less costly in terms of a possible temporary loss of production and employment that can in any case not be sustained  than the sacrifices that will eventually be required to fight high inflation once it has become entrenched. In the present situation  the Reserve Bank feels that a cautious monetary policy stance remains justified. This has been the approach throughout the past year and undoubtedly has had a major influence on developments in the money market. The shortage of funds in this market  as reflected by the amount of accommodation required by banking institutions from the Reserve Bank  first increased from a daily average of R4.9 billion in January 1996 to R10.6 billion in March 1997  before it declined to R7.3 billion in July 1997. As the recovery in the balance of payments recently gained momentum  the Reserve Bank has been prepared to allow a natural downward adjustment in the money market shortage  paving the way for a gradual decline in money market interest rates. BIS Review 77/1997 - 7 - The Reserve Bank raised its lending rate to banking institutions  the Bank rate  from 15 per cent at the end of 1995 to 16 per cent in April 1996  and then to 17 per cent in November 1996. The rate on three-month bankers’ acceptances first increased sharply from 14.6 per cent at the end of December 1995 to 17.0 per cent a year later  but has since declined gradually to 15.0 per cent in the middle of August 1997. As the South African financial markets are being integrated more in the global financial system  the comparison between South African and international interest rates takes on greater significance. Too low a level of interest rates locally will eventually be reflected in a weak currency  and lead to a further depreciation of the rand. Too high a level  on the other hand  will attract speculative short-term capital from abroad  and lead to an undesirable appreciation of the currency  and/or an unhealthy expansion of domestic liquidity. The sharply inverted shape of the yield curve in South Africa makes the comparison of the level of local interest rates with the international markets more difficult. At the long end of the spectrum  the yield on long-term government bonds in South Africa seems to be on the low side in real terms. Short-term interest rates  and particularly bank lending rates at the other end of the yield curve  seem to be high in South Africa  reflecting negative expectations on inflation  high risks involved in more short-term lending to an already overborrowed community  and a relatively high demand for funds. The conservative monetary policy measures applied by the Reserve Bank over the past eighteen months have paid off by containing the increase in inflation to below 10 per cent  despite the pressures arising from the depreciation of the rand last year. Measured over a period of twelve months  the rate of increase in the overall production price index rose from 5.3 per cent in April 1996 to 9.6 per cent in March 1997  but then declined to 7.5 per cent in June 1997. Movements in the consumer price index followed a similar path and the increase in consumer prices  measured over twelve months  rose from 5.5 per cent in April 1996 to 9.9 per cent in April 1997  before declining to 8.8 per cent in June 1997. At the time of the depreciation of the rand in 1996  a much higher rate of inflation was predicted on the basis of previous experience. There is  however  no reason for complacency. As long as the South African rate of inflation remains significantly higher than that in the major countries of the world  the integration of South Africa into the global financial markets will be slow and turbulent. In view of the complex interaction between the level of interest rates  the rate of inflation  and the exchange rate in the process of financial globalisation  disruptive adjustments will be demanded from time to time. This will continue to complicate decisions for investors and cross-border traders. Participation in the process of financial globalisation ultimately requires a high degree of convergence between countries in these basic financial aggregates. The domestic levels for interest and exchange rates can no longer be determined by governments or central banks in isolation. These financial prices will indeed increasingly be driven by international market consensus. At this stage  the international market imperative requires of South Africa to bring its rate of inflation gradually in line with the rest of the world. Alternatively  the country’s drive towards greater participation as an important borrower of funds in the world financial markets will be constrained. BIS Review 77/1997 - 8 - Furthermore  what is even more important is that the existing imbalances of income and wealth in the domestic economy will further deteriorate in an inflationary environment. It is relatively easy for those more fortunate members of society to protect themselves against inflation as they have easy access to credit and can spend more in today’s terms  hoping to repay with depreciated money sometime in the future. Less fortunate members of the society find that wage increases do not keep up with inflation  especially run-away rising inflation  and their savings and buying power deteriorate continuously. Financial market reforms pay dividends The major reforms in South Africa’s financial markets over the past few years paid good dividends in the form of substantial increases in the volume of business done through these various markets. Structural improvements introduced by the Johannesburg Stock Exchange  the Bond Exchange of South Africa  and the South African Futures Exchange (SAFEX)  were also boosted by the further relaxation of exchange controls. The value of bonds traded in the Bond Exchange of South Africa increased by 51 per cent in 1996 to exceed the R3 000 billion level. In the first half of 1997  the total turnover in this market already exceeded R1 700 billion. These higher values included a substantial increase in transactions effected by non-residents in the market. The value of shares traded in the secondary share market increased from R63 billion in 1995 to R117 billion in 1996  and to R92 billion for the first half of 1997. As in the case of the Bond Exchange  non-residents also made an important contribution to the increase in business transacted through the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The turnover in options and futures contracts traded through SAFEX performed likewise  showing sharp increases over the past eighteen months. The importance of the formal capital markets for the economic development of South Africa can be clearly illustrated by two basic statistics. Firstly  over the eighteen months from the beginning of 1996 up to the middle of 1997  the amount of new capital raised through issues on the Stock Exchange and net issues of fixed interest-bearing securities in the primary bond market amounted to approximately R50 billion. Secondly  over the same period  net purchases by non-residents of South African securities listed on the exchanges amounted to about R34 billion. Supportive fiscal policies The Minister of Finance applied further disciplines in his Budget proposals for 1997/98 with a commitment to reduce both government dissaving and the deficit before borrowing during the current fiscal year. In the preceding year net dissaving by government was equal to 3.1 per cent  and the budget deficit equal to 5.6 per cent of gross domestic product. The deficit for the current fiscal year is expected to be reduced to 4.0 per cent of gross domestic product. The Government also made an important contribution to the official foreign reserves of the country by way of two bond issues in international capital markets during June 1997. The total proceeds from these two loans amounted to R3.8 billion. A few smaller and one major privatisation transaction – the sale of an equity stake of 30 per cent in Telkom – raised more than R6 billion over the past year. Part of these funds BIS Review 77/1997 - 9 - was used to contain total government debt to a level of about 56 per cent of gross domestic product. The better harmonisation of monetary and fiscal policies over the past year made a major contribution to the success achieved with the objective of restoring overall financial stability after the foreign exchange market disruption of February last year. Financial co-operation in Southern Africa The Committee of Governors of the Central Banks of the twelve members of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) met twice during the past twelve months to discuss matters of financial co-operation. The Secretariat of the Committee within the Reserve Bank has made good progress in the compilation of a computerised data base of financial statistics of the region and information on the functions and responsibilities of the twelve participating central banks. Officials from all the central banks participated in a number of courses presented by the Reserve Bank’s Training Institute  and a course was again presented for bank regulators and supervisors in the East and Southern Africa Banking Supervisors Group (ESAF). A special study is being undertaken with the support of the World Bank on the development of national payment and clearing systems with a view to the eventual establishment of a cross-border payment and settlement system for all SADC countries. Over the next year  the co-ordination of financial co-operation in the region will be extended also to include the activities of commercial (private) banks and stock exchanges. A need for more flexible monetary policy operations Developments over the past year revealed a need for greater flexibility in the market for short-term funds. The transformation in the South African financial markets since 1994  and in particular the further integration into the global financial system  will in future require more prompt action and decisive direction for movements in financial asset prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Part of the explanation for the rigidities in the South African money market lies with the present system used by the Reserve Bank to provide accommodation to banking institutions at the discount window. Banking institutions have unlimited access at the Bank rate to overnight loans from the discount window  provided they have at their disposal acceptable collateral. The Bank accepts Treasury bills  Land Bank bills  South African Reserve Bank paper and Government bonds  all with an outstanding maturity of less than 91 days  as security for such overnight loans. A second-tier facility is also available  but at a penalty rate of 75 percentage points above the Bank rate against similar securities as collateral  but with outstanding maturities of between 91 days and three years. The Bank rate is  of course  changed from time to time to adapt to changes in underlying financial market conditions. To make the system work effectively  the market must react with sensitivity to changes in underlying demand and supply conditions  and must also emit clear and comprehensible signals to the authorities. For example  a rise in market interest rates for interbank funds  various maturities of negotiable certificates of deposit  or for bankers’ acceptances to the Bank rate level or above  will provide a clear indication of a need for an increase in the Bank rate. Alternatively  when a Bank rate increase is regarded as undesirable at BIS Review 77/1997 - 10 - that point in time  the Reserve Bank will have to use other means at its disposal to create more liquidity (money) in order to reduce the pressure on interest rates. Over the past year  major changes took place in South Africa’s underlying money market conditions  but money market interest rates were slow to react to these changes at a time when the Bank was looking for signals from the market  while the market sought guidance from the Bank on the direction of interest rates. It is clearly necessary to find a way out of this uncertain situation and to ensure that greater flexibility will be introduced in the working of the money market. Inflexible markets  be they for goods  services  labour or financing  invariably lead to incorrect pricing  inefficient allocation of resources and  ultimately  unnecessary and costly losses in output and employment. In March 1998  the Reserve Bank will start introducing a new upgraded electronically-driven National Payment System to provide for a daily automated settlement of outstanding interbank positions. The system is planned to be extended by September 1998 to effect intraday settlements on a gross basis for large transactions. The introduction of the new versatile payment and settlement system will also provide a good opportunity for the Reserve Bank to reconsider the existing accommodation arrangements between the Bank and private banking institutions. At this stage  the Bank would like to give notice of the proposed introduction of a new  more flexible accommodation facility  to be created in the form of regular repurchase transactions between the Reserve Bank and its banking sector clients. The private banks will be offered the opportunity to tender on a regular basis for central bank funds through the repurchase facility  and accordingly be given more scope to manage their own liquidity positions better. Furthermore  the purpose of the minimum cash reserve accounts that banks must maintain with the Reserve Bank will be extended to serve also as operational accounts for the regular settlement of clearing account balances. An averaging principle will be introduced  in terms of which each bank will have to ensure that the average daily balance in its account over a monthly period will comply with the prescribed minimum cash reserve requirements. This should enable the banks  during the course of the month  to use their minimum reserve balances for settlement purposes. The present discount window facility will still be retained to provide banks with a further source of funds for the management of their liquidity positions. It is envisaged  however  that the Bank rate for such loans will be at a substantial premium to the fluctuating effective interest rate as established in the regular repurchase transactions. The Department of Finance is planning to implement new arrangements for the primary issue of  and the secondary market-making in  Government bonds through appointed private market securities dealers. The transfer of these functions from the Reserve Bank to securities dealers will strengthen the Reserve Bank’s ability to pursue open-market operations more vigorously for monetary policy purposes. The Bank is now in the process of preparing a discussion document on the proposed new accommodation procedures. This document will be distributed to the banking community and to other interested parties before the end of October for comments and participation in the preparation of the new system. BIS Review 77/1997 - 11 - It must not be expected  however  that the introduction of the new system will lead to a permanently lower level of interest rates. The Reserve Bank may well in future use interest rates more frequently and extensively to pursue its overriding objective of protecting the value of the currency. The Bank will nevertheless have to ensure that interest rates will be maintained at a level that will be consistent with all the other objectives of monetary policy  and with developments in other economic aggregates. Internal administration of the Bank With the appointment of Mr. James Cross as Deputy Governor from 1 January 1997  all vacancies in the top management of the Bank have now been filled again for the first time since July 1995. The total staff complement of the Bank varied around 1 800 during the year ended 31 March 1997. At the same time  further progress was made with the Bank’s transformation process when more than 70 per cent of the 136 new appointments to the Bank was drawn from previously under-represented groups. The Bank’s international activities were affected to an important extent by the currency turmoils of last year. The International Banking Department  in particular  was frustrated by these developments  which temporarily disrupted the longer-term programme of increasing the country’s foreign reserves and reducing the role of the Bank in the forward foreign exchange market. These programmes are  however  now back on course  and the recent successful conclusion of a syndicated loan facility for a total amount of US$ 1.75 billion served to strengthen the Bank’s foreign liquidity position further. Good progress was made by the Information Technology Department to prepare the way for the introduction of a new real-time gross settlement system within the banking sector. The substructures for this ambitious new programme are now in place  and  as already indicated  the first phase will go live in March next year. Precautions were also taken to ensure that all the Bank’s electronic data processing systems will be able to cope with the technical “Year 2000” problem with the change-over to the next millennium. The Economics Department is likewise involved in guiding the Bank into the fast-expanding  worldwide electronic-communication system. South Africa was one of the first countries to subscribe to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in August 1996  and is now one of only eight countries that provide electronic links (hyperlinks) from the IMF’s SDDS to the more comprehensive sites of important South African economic data and information. In March 1997  the Quarterly Bulletin of the Reserve Bank was released for the first time in its entirety with text  graphs and statistical tables on the Internet. The Exchange Control Department is continuing with the task of gradually phasing out all the remaining exchange controls. The concessions made to private individuals to invest limited amounts abroad as from 1 July 1997  and all the other exchange control relaxations over the past year  were implemented smoothly and efficiently. Subject to the approval of the Minister of Finance  the phasing out of the remaining exchange controls will continue in an orderly manner. During the former Management Services and Administration Departments were merged into a new Corporate Services Department as part of an internal rationalisation programme. A new Organisation Development Department was created to give the year  BIS Review 77/1997 - 12 - more specialised attention development  and the co-ordination of strategic planning and development. the Bank’s transformation programme  human resource to With the rapid increase in the number of foreign banks operating in South Africa  and with the establishment in many other countries of branches  subsidiaries and representative offices of South African banks  the resources of the Bank Supervision Department came under pressure. The Office of the Registrar nevertheless also gave special attention to specific problem areas such as illegal deposit-taking operations  micro-lending activities  deposit insurance schemes and regional co-operation in Southern Africa. Other administrative functions of the Bank  such as note and coin distribution  protective services and the branch network are being taxed by the ever-increasing need for greater vigilance against fraud  burglaries and violent criminal attacks. The Bank relies heavily on its Internal Audit Department for the early detection of any possible irregular activities  as well as for sound risk management. A major contribution is made in this area by the Audit Subcommittee of the Board  and also by the external auditors. In retrospect  the Bank can be grateful for the quality of its staff  and for their loyalty to the task of the Bank as demonstrated again by the excellence of services rendered during the past year. Concluding remarks In its Macroeconomic Strategy for Growth  Employment and Redistribution  the Government defined the role of monetary policy as follows: “The main objective of monetary policy will continue to be the maintenance of financial stability and the reduction of the inflation rate. Positive real interest rates are a minimum condition for overall financial stability. Low inflation is an important requirement for higher economic growth  the creation of employment opportunities and a more equitable distribution of income.” Looking back  the past year was particularly challenging for macroeconomic management. The Reserve Bank can be satisfied that it has been relatively successful in making its specialised contribution to the attainment of the Government’s overall economic objectives as set out in GEAR. After major disturbances in the market for foreign exchange early in 1996  stability has been restored. The rate of inflation  which accelerated to nearly 10 per cent by April 1997  is now abating. To achieve these results required a consistent restrictive monetary policy with relatively high interest rates. As the monetary policy objectives are being consolidated and other programmes of GEAR  for example to increase total saving in the economy  are being implemented with greater effect  the way will be paved for lower interest rates on a more durable basis. The contribution that monetary policy can make towards the attainment of maximum economic development and the creation of more employment opportunities is  after all  limited to the intermediate goal of maintaining a stable financial environment. Attempts to use monetary policy for wider purposes or  more directly  to solve problems in the real economic sphere are bound to lead to an inflationary dead end. However sincere intentions might be  the inevitable result will eventually be lower growth and even less employment. BIS Review 77/1997 - 13 - The policy of persisting with essential monetary disciplines in South Africa at this difficult stage of general transformation is understandably being opposed in some circles  due to adjustment fatigue and frustrated expectations. It is imperative  however  for the sake of attaining higher economic growth of a more durable nature  to ensure overall financial stability that will also make access to the world financial markets easier for South African borrowers. This task demands the continuous implementation of monetary policies that will create a financial environment with low inflation  a sound banking system  and well-functioning financial markets. I wish to place on record my appreciation to Minister Trevor Manuel  Deputy Minister Gill Marcus  Ms. Maria Ramos  Director-General of Finance  and also all the officials in the Department of Finance  for their continued support and close co-operation over the past year. I thank my colleagues on the Board of the Bank for their undivided loyalty during difficult times. Finally  thanks are also due to the three Deputy Governors and staff of the Bank for keeping the many activities of the South African Reserve Bank at a level where the Bank has come to be respected as one of the most efficient institutions of its kind in the world today.

r970905b,1997-09-05,https://www.bis.org/review/r970905b.pdf,Bank of Japan's summary of the annual review of monetary and economic developments in fiscal 1996,BANK OF JAPAN  ANNUAL REVIEW 1997.,Bank of Japan’s summary of the annual review of monetary and economic developments in fiscal 1996 BANK OF JAPAN  ANNUAL REVIEW 1997. Overview Japan’s economy followed a moderate recovery trend in fiscal 1996. The pace of recovery began to accelerate at the end of 1995  aided by substantially stimulative monetary and fiscal policy measures  and the recovery continued in fiscal 1996. In the second half of the fiscal year  the economic recovery firmed  particularly in private demand  driven in part by the depreciation of the yen since the previous year. With respect to final demand in the first half of fiscal 1996  net exports declined sharply  reflecting such factors as the appreciation of the yen until the middle of 1995 and the increase in imports of manufactured goods from Japanese affiliates overseas. However  the economic recovery was underpinned by policy-related demand factors  such as the increase in public-sector investment reflecting the economic stimulus package of autumn 1995  and the high level of housing investment induced by low interest rates. In the middle of fiscal 1996  public-sector investment began to decline gradually from its peak  while net exports  which had been restraining the economic recovery  started to rise  partly reflecting the depreciation of the yen. Regarding private demand  business fixed investment increased steadily throughout the fiscal year  reflecting recovery in corporate profits  progress in stock adjustments  and a rise in autonomous investment  such as in information technology  and the increase spread across industries from large manufacturing firms to small nonmanufacturing firms. Personal consumption followed a moderate recovery trend in line with a recovery in compensation of employees despite fluctuations caused by factors such as the weather. From autumn 1996  automobile sales  which have a large influence on production  accelerated. Housing investment remained high  owing both to the increase in demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate  implemented in April 1997  and to low interest rates. Industrial production remained virtually unchanged until the middle of 1996  reflecting the decrease in net exports  and adjustments in the excessive inventories of some producer goods. However  growth in production has gradually gathered pace since the middle of the year  as private demand has increased steadily  net exports have begun to increase  and the increase in final demand has led more directly to a rise in production because of progress in inventory adjustments. At the end of the fiscal year  both industrial production and shipments recovered to the levels recorded at the previous peak in the economic cycle reflecting the increase in demand before the rise in the consumption tax rate. In these circumstances  corporate profits continued to recover primarily among large manufacturing firms  driven in part by a rise in profits of processing industries reflecting the depreciation of the yen and the success of corporate restructuring efforts. Business confidence also improved gradually  according to the Bank of Japan’s “Tankan—Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan.” The improvement in profits of large manufacturing firms was reflected in an increase in their expenditures  which in turn contributed to a recovery in the business conditions of corporate service industries and small manufacturing firms. As for labor market conditions  the unemployment rate remained high and growth in the number of the regularly employed stagnated owing to persistent adjustment pressures on personnel expenses in the corporate sector. However  overtime working hours and the number of new job offers increased steadily  reflecting production growth and improvements in corporate profits  and compensation of employees rose gradually  particularly in special cash earnings. In sum  the overall labor market conditions followed a recovery trend. BIS Review 78/1997 - 2 - While substantially stimulative monetary and fiscal policy measures in fiscal 1995 continued to underpin economic recovery in early fiscal 1996  a positive cycle of demand  production  and income began to operate  underpinning the economic recovery throughout fiscal 1996. That is  an increase in final demand pushed up production and led to an improvement in corporate profits  particularly among large manufacturing firms. This in turn led to an improvement in profits and a rise in compensation of employees among nonmanufacturing firms and small firms  thereby expanding expenditures. During the second half of fiscal 1996  the recovery in private demand firmed  reflecting the positive effects of the depreciation of the yen on corporate profits  despite a decrease in public-sector investment. In other words  although the pace of the economic recovery remained moderate  a recovery led by policy demand is gradually shifting toward one led by private demand. Although Japan’s economy bottomed out at the end of 1993  the pace of recovery remains relatively moderate  owing to various structural adjustment pressures on industries. These include (1) pressures for the industrial structure to change in response to global competition resulting from the expansion of supply capacity in Asian countries  and to the constant appreciation of the yen until the middle of 1995; and (2) balance-sheet adjustment pressures owing to the sharp and significant decline in asset prices since the bursting of the economic “bubble” in the late 1980s. Steady progress has been made in dealing with the pressures for the industrial structure to change  as reflected in (1) a significant improvement in corporate profits  particularly among large manufacturing firms  resulting from the successful restructuring efforts and the depreciation of the yen from the middle of 1995; (2) progress in the reorganization of the international production system as seen in the shift in Japan’s exports and production toward more capital- and technology-intensive goods; and (3) increased business fixed investment in new sectors owing to technological innovations and deregulation in information and communications industries. With regard to balance-sheet adjustments  strong adjustment pressures remained throughout fiscal 1996  as seen in the persistently high level of the ratio of debts to assets  especially among small nonmanufacturing firms. In fiscal 1996  weakening of prices came to a halt. Domestic wholesale prices followed a downward trend until the middle of 1996  but in the second half of fiscal 1996 they virtually stopped declining  owing to a moderate improvement in domestic supply and demand conditions  as well as a rise in import prices reflecting the depreciation of the yen and the rise in crude oil prices. In March 1997  the year-to-year change shifted from decline to increase. Although corporate service prices continued to decline compared to the level of the previous year  reflecting the decrease in leasing prices and real estate rents  the year-to-year declines were smaller in the second half of fiscal 1996  due to a recovery in demand for services following the improvement in corporate profits. Consumer prices (nationwide  excluding perishables) also increased by a slightly wider margin from the previous year owing to a smaller decline in commodity prices as a result of the depreciation of the yen  and the halt in the decline in domestic wholesale prices  as well as a gradual increase in service prices. While prices seemed to have stopped declining  the increase in import prices from the depreciation of the yen and higher crude oil prices had little impact on domestic prices  as there remained persistent downward pressures on prices from imports of manufactured goods  particularly final goods  and technological innovations. As for commercial land  prices for large and well-located plots of land suitable for development virtually stopped declining owing mainly to the gradual progress in stock adjustment for office space. However  the prices of smaller plots of land with limited commercial value continued to decline. The recent development in commercial land prices thus indicates a distinct splitting into two groups. Meanwhile  residential land prices are bottoming out  reflecting the high level of residential housing construction. BIS Review 78/1997 - 3 - The cyclical momentum for economic recovery gathered strength in fiscal 1996. However  the pace of the recovery remained moderate owing to continued structural adjustment pressures  including the balance-sheet problems. Although weakening of prices had come to a halt by the second half of fiscal 1996  prices were unlikely to follow an upward trend. Against the background of these economic and price conditions  the Bank of Japan maintained an easy monetary policy  keeping the official discount rate at its September 1995 level of 0.5 percent to establish a solid foundation for the economic recovery. As for financial developments  the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) remained on average slightly below the official discount rate following monetary adjustments by the Bank of Japan. Long-term interest rates continued to rise with some fluctuations in the first half of 1996  but fell sharply in the second half. Interest rates on short-term instruments  namely 3-month certificate of deposit (CD) rates  followed a similar trend  although with smaller fluctuations than those in long-term interest rates. Stock prices continued to rise during the first half of 1996  but began to weaken in the summer  and fell sharply from the end of the year. The year-to-year growth rate of M2+CDs  a representative indicator of monetary aggregates  generally remained around 3.0-4.0 percent  but declined slightly in the second half of the fiscal year  partly due to the slow growth in funding in the private sector. Despite the firm recovery of the real economy  particularly in the private sector during the second half of fiscal 1996  the financial markets during this period adopted a more cautious stance. This was because (1) the financial markets reacted in anticipation of the fiscal tightening measures—such as the rise in the consumption tax rate and the termination of special tax reductions in fiscal 1997—and this had restraining effects on economic conditions; and (2) there was renewed awareness that various adjustment pressures  especially balance-sheet adjustment pressures  remained strong among small nonmanufacturing firms and financial institutions. Under these circumstances  the cyclical developments of the economic recovery were not immediately reflected in financial indicators through the confidence of market participants. Meanwhile  significant progress was made in fiscal 1996 in the solution of the jusen (housing loan companies) problem  and steady progress was also made in solving the problem of nonperforming assets of financial institutions  including improvements in the framework for the resolution of failed financial institutions. With respect to the outlook  the probability that Japan’s economy will continue to recover is rising  although the pace of recovery may decelerate temporarily. This expectation is based on the fact that the positive cycle of production and consumption has not been deterred by the reaction to the increase in demand ahead of the consumption tax rate rise. Despite the continued economic recovery  the private sector has not gained sufficient confidence in its future growth  reflecting persistent uncertainty about structural adjustments. Under the structural adjustment pressures  expected growth rates are unlikely to rise at the same pace in different industries and firms. However  from a long-term perspective  the establishment of a new industrial structure based on the principle of comparative advantage can be expected to enhance growth by promoting the efficiency of resource allocation. In order for Japan’s economy to achieve sustainable growth  it is vital to create investment opportunities and raise expected growth rates of economic entities through effective reforms of the economic structure. Such efforts are essential in adapting to the medium- to long-term changes in economic environment  including increasing global competitive pressures  and the further aging of the population  and in maintaining Japan’s economic strength. Considering the important role that the financial sector must play in the reforms of the economic structure  it will be necessary to continue implementing measures to stabilize the BIS Review 78/1997 - 4 - Japanese financial system  and increase domestic and overseas confidence in the system. At the same time  the financial system must be reorganized to enhance its functions and competitiveness  by improving the infrastructure in order to promote competition in accordance with the Japanese “Big Bang” deregulation package.

Revision of Japan’s Flow of Funds Accounts Introduction Bank of Japan compiled the first flow of funds accounts in 1958  covering datafor the years from 1954 to 1957. Since then  the flow of funds accounts have been used extensively  for example  as a source for producing the capital finance account of the national accounts  and as the only statistical material that provides an overall picture of Japan’s financial structure. However  the present flow of funds accounts require improvement in many respects. For example  although the framework of the flow of funds accounts basically conforms to that of the System of National Accounts established in 1968 by the United Nations (hereafter  1968 SNA)  various inconsistencies remain between the two due to inadequate availability of data. This results in various limitations when one tries to obtain a combined picture of real economic activity and financial activity using the flow of funds accounts and the national accounts. It should also be noted that the 1968 SNA itself does not fully reflect the changes in economic and financial structures that have occurred in the years since it was established. In 1993  therefore  the Statistical Commission under the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (hereafter  ECOSOC Statistical Commission) adopted a draft amendment to the SNA (1993 SNA) with a view to creating a framework that better reflects the recent economic and financial environment. Further  in response to increasing demand for internationally standardized financial statistics  the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  at the behest of the ECOSOC Statistical Commission  is preparing a Manual on Monetary and Financial Statistics (hereafter  the IMF Manual) to supplement the 1993 SNA. A number of countries have initiated reviews of their flow of funds accounts in accordance with these developments. Statistics that provide a highly reliable overview of financial activities are indispensable for tracing changes in the financial structure  for examining the roles of each economic sector  and for considering the implications of these factors for the real economy. Such statistics are also useful in considering various issues concerning financial systems. If these statistics are compiled in accordance with international standards  international comparability of these statistics will be improved. BIS Review 78/1997 It is for these reasons that the Bank is revising Japan’s flow of funds accounts. In doing so  the Bank has decided to make public its basic thinking underlying the revision  together with the outline of the revision  to thereby seek the users’ opinions  which the Bank - 2 - The Framework for Restructuring the BOJ-NET Funds Transfer System Introduction In December 1996  the Bank of Japan published a consultation paper that outlined its plans to restructure the funds transfer system of the Bank of Japan Financial Network System (BOJ-NET). The Bank plans to abolish designated-time settlement and make real-time gross settlement (RTGS) the only settlement mode by the end of the year 2000. The paper also drafted the main features of RTGS after the restructuring  and the Bank requested comments and suggestions from current account holders with the Bank of Japan (BOJ account holders)  the operators of private clearing systems  and other interested parties. Overall  the Bank’s proposal was strongly supported  and the Bank received a number of constructive comments and suggestions on its proposal. On the basis of its December proposal and the comments and suggestions received  the Bank released on April 1  1997 a framework for abolishing designated-time settlement and making RTGS the only settlement mode in the BOJ-NET funds transfer system.

Mr Chairman  I am delighted to be back in Pukekohe  though I must admit I’d rather be next door in my orchard instead of in here  explaining the impact of monetary policy on the fruit-growing industry! Two months ago  when you asked me to speak this afternoon  you asked me to focus on exchange rates. In particular  you suggested I speak about ‘fluctuations and long term trends in exchange rates and their effects on export commodity pricing’. I am happy to do that  but I also want to make a few comments on the Reserve Bank’s Monetary Conditions Index  both because it is relevant to the subject you have asked me to address and because the MCI has become the subject of a good deal of public discussion and debate over the last month or two. Indeed  some claim it is only the Reserve Bank’s obsession with the MCI that has seen exchange rate and interest rates pushed around in a rather volatile manner over the last couple of months. The exchange rate First let me talk a little about the exchange rate. Here the concerns seem to be partly about fluctuations in the exchange rate and partly about the long-term trends  as your suggested subject for my speech indicates. I have to say that I do not have a great deal of sympathy for those who complain about the fluctuations in the exchange rate  and that for two quite different reasons. First  and most obviously  there is now a very well-developed market in forward foreign exchange contracts  so that it is readily possible for exporters to fix the exchange rate at which they sell their products long before they actually want to repatriate the proceeds to New Zealand. Exporters may  of course  choose not to use that market and instead gamble that they might get a more favourable exchange rate at some stage in the future. They should be free to make that choice. But it is important to recognise that they are deliberately taking on foreign exchange risk in the hope of getting something better in the future. They are not obliged to gamble in this way. This point is perhaps particularly relevant at the moment  when a number of farmers are lamenting the fact that  while the exchange rate is now much more attractive  that doesn’t help farmers because few have stock to sell at the moment. But there is nothing at all stopping farmers who have no stock to sell  or meat companies on their behalf  from buying foreign exchange forward at the currently prevailing rates  and locking in current exchange rates. By doing that  they eliminate the risk that the exchange rate may rise before their stock is ready for sale  but of course they also pass up the additional benefit they might get if the exchange rate were to fall further. Secondly  although the New Zealand dollar has been subject to quite marked fluctuations over the last few months  by and large the New Zealand dollar is not a volatile currency by the standards of other floating rate currencies. Certainly measured on a trade- weighted basis  the New Zealand dollar has in recent years been less volatile on a week-to-week basis than  say  the Australian dollar  the US dollar  the pound sterling  or the Japanese yen. BIS Review 78/1997 - 2 - What about the longer-term trends? Since at least the beginning of the seventies  the trade-weighted measure of the New Zealand dollar has tended to move to reflect differences between inflation in New Zealand and inflation in our trading partners (graph 1). Graph 1: Relative Consumer Prices and Nominal TWI (1970 - June 1997 average equals 100) Index 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 Nominal TWI Foreign/Domestic price level Index 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 70 72 74 76 78 80 82 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 In other words  when inflation was higher than in our trading partners  the New Zealand dollar had a tendency to depreciate. When inflation was lower than in our trading partners  the New Zealand dollar had a tendency to appreciate. Occasionally  the exchange rate Graph 2: Nominal and 'Real' Trade Weighted Exchange Rate (1970 - June 1997 average equals 100) Index 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 Nominal TWI Foreign/Domestic price level 'Real' exchange rate Index 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 70 72 74 76 78 80 82 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 BIS Review 78/1997 - 3 - would depreciate a little faster than seemed warranted by a relatively poor inflation performance in New Zealand  and exporters enjoyed the experience. Occasionally  as in the period from early 1993 to early 1997  the exchange rate appreciated faster than seemed warranted by a relatively good inflation performance  and exporters found the experience anything but enjoyable (graph 2). If historical relationships hold  one would expect the New Zealand dollar to move broadly in line with inflation differentials over the longer term  and a few months ago this led a number of commentators to suggest that  at that time  the New Zealand dollar was clearly over-valued. Last December I also expressed the view that  at that time  the New Zealand dollar did indeed seem somewhat over-valued on that basis  though it should be noted that  to the extent that productivity growth is higher in New Zealand than in our trading partners  one would expect to see the exchange rate rise somewhat faster than inflation differentials alone would suggest. I have no difficulty at all in acknowledging the fact that the appreciation in the New Zealand dollar from its floor of around 53 (on a trade-weighted basis) in January 1993 to 69.3 in March 1997  an increase of some 30 percent over just four years  put significant pressure on a great many exporters. But four points need to be made in qualification. First  it is very likely that an exchange rate of 53 on a trade-weighted basis was as unsustainable as an exchange rate of 69.3. Neither represents an ‘equilibrium’ level of the exchange rate  so to measure exchange rate appreciation from that artificially low level risks creating quite a false impression. Secondly  while acknowledging the pressure which the rising exchange rate from 1993 to early 1997 placed on exporters  I am bound to express a degree of cynicism about the way in which some producer boards have described this impact. To hear some tell it  the impact of the rising exchange rate on the gross incomes of farmers and orchardists is the same as the impact of the exchange rate on their net incomes  and of course that it not correct. Granted  our land-based export industries are not heavy users of imports  but they do use diesel  they do use tractors  they do use fertilisers  and they are heavily affected by the costs of transport to and from the farm-gate. And from their net incomes they still spend money on petrol for the family car  they still buy clothes  they still buy other goods which are imported. The New Zealand dollar price of all these items would have been significantly higher over the last few years had it not been for the appreciation of the currency. Indeed  it is very likely that wage increases would also have been significantly higher if there had been no currency appreciation. So while the increase in the New Zealand dollar in recent years has undoubtedly had a severe impact on gross farm incomes  the impact on farmers’ living standards was rather less severe. Thirdly  while the exchange rate appreciation has clearly made matters worse  the basic problem facing our land-based exporters is that the inflation-adjusted  or real  price of many of the items which they produce has been declining  and that for a long period. The New Zealand Meat and Wool Boards’ Economic Service tells me that between 1948 (prior to the Korean War boom) and 1996  the inflation-adjusted price of lamb fell by 45 percent in the US market; the price of dairy products fell by 55 percent; the price of beef fell by 69 percent; and the price of wool fell by 79 percent. I don’t know that anybody was noticing the price of kiwifruit in the US market in 1948  but I can still recall that in 1982  just 15 years ago  the orchard-gate price of New Zealand kiwifruit was $11 per tray. Nobody yet knows what we will realise in 1997  but if the orchard-gate price for this year’s crop is  say  $4.30 per tray  that will be an inflation-adjusted fall in the orchard-gate price of some 85 percent in just 15 years - and BIS Review 78/1997 - 4 - that over a period during which the New Zealand dollar has fallen quite substantially against the currencies of virtually all our trading partners  and especially against the Japanese yen and the German mark  the two currencies of most direct relevance to kiwifruit exports. The basic reality is that the market price of kiwifruit has fallen substantially over that time. And in case New Zealand exporters feel hard done by by this reality  remember that very substantial falls in inflation-adjusted prices are common for most commodities  and indeed for a great many other goods and services as well. Productivity improves  and international competition often ensures that the benefit of that improvement is passed on to consumers  rather than retained by producers. Reflect on the huge fall in the real price of computers - a fall which dwarfs the falls suffered by New Zealand land-based exporters - or the price of television sets  or of motor vehicles  or of international air travel  or of long-distance telephone calls. Large price falls are by no means unique to the products which New Zealand exports. To remain viable  all producers must be constantly seeking new ways to improve productivity or add value  and if they do that successfully  they can maintain profitability despite a trend decline in prices. Finally  apart altogether from the tendency for the prices of many commodities to decline in the long term  commodity prices tend to be volatile and in recent years this volatility has tended to swamp the impact of exchange rate trends. The best illustration is the experience of beef farmers in the three years to the middle of 1996: of the fall in the farm-gate price of bull beef over that period  more than three-quarters was caused by a fall in overseas market prices  and less than one-quarter by the rise in the exchange rate. In other words  the fall in the market price of bull beef was substantially greater in its impact on farmers than the effect of the increase in the exchange rate. Our land-based exporters operate in inherently volatile markets  and would face major swings in prices even if  in some way  the New Zealand dollar could be held absolutely stable. This should influence what can sensibly be paid for farming and orcharding assets. So yes  monetary policy does have an impact on the exchange rate  but that in turn has much less impact on exporters’ net incomes than on gross incomes  and has been of very much less significance to land-based exporters than the fluctuations in international commodity prices and the long-term decline in the real prices of many of the commodities which New Zealand exports. The Monetary Conditions Index But what of the Reserve Bank’s Monetary Conditions Index? Is the MCI  as some have suggested  really to blame for much of the current economic slowdown  or at very least for the sharp increase in interest rates recently? Before answering those questions  it is worth recalling briefly that  once every three months  the Reserve Bank does a comprehensive projection of the New Zealand economy and of inflation for a period of two or three years. That projection takes into account all the information available to the Bank at that time - the official statistics covering GDP  prices  wages  employment  imports  exports  and all the rest; the data collected by the Bank itself on the money and credit aggregates  and the path of interest and exchange rates; the survey data covering business and consumer confidence; the views expressed to us  formally and informally  about individual businesses and the economy; and much more. At the end of that process  we reach a view on how firm monetary conditions need to be to keep inflation moving towards the middle part of the 0 to 3 percent inflation target we have agreed with Government. BIS Review 78/1997 - 5 - But of course neither we nor any other central bank can control the mix of monetary conditions. In other words  we can tighten monetary conditions  but we can not determine whether that tightening takes the form of an increase in interest rates with little or no increase in the exchange rate; or an increase in the exchange rate with little or no increase in interest rates; or an increase in the exchange rate with a decrease in interest rates; or an increase in interest rates and a fall in the exchange rate. The mix depends on the perceptions and reactions of a great many people  here and abroad  and indeed on what other central banks are doing or are expected to do. What to do? In a small open economy like New Zealand  it is impossible to ignore the fact that monetary policy affects inflation through both interest rates and the exchange rate  and for a number of years we have factored that into our policy setting. What the Monetary Conditions Index seeks to do is to give the public and financial markets a broad indication of how we see the relative impact of interest rates and the exchange rate on medium-term inflation with a ‘rule of thumb’ combining both. Nobody can be dogmatic about the precise nature of this relative impact - it clearly differs between economies depending on the importance of international trade  and almost certainly varies depending on the stage of the economic cycle. On the basis of research to date we believe it is reasonable to suggest that a 1 percent increase in 90 day interest rates has roughly the same effect on inflation  in the medium-term  as a 2 percent increase in the (trade-weighted) exchange rate. This ratio is particularly helpful in helping us to assess how the overall degree of monetary restraint is evolving when interest rates and the exchange rate are moving in opposite directions  as has often been the case over the last year. In June this year  we expressed this relationship in numerical form  called it the Monetary Conditions Index  and indicated that our projected inflation track was based on monetary conditions being at 825 on that Index through the September quarter. Has this increased openness been constructive or destructive? On balance  I have no doubt that it has been constructive. Financial markets now know explicitly what in the past they could only guess at  namely how we ‘translated’ movements in exchange rates into movements in interest rates in assessing their effect on inflation. In the last few months  we have experienced the sharpest decline in the New Zealand dollar since late 1991 without any kind of drama or crisis. Interest rates have adjusted upwards to offset the effect of that depreciation on the medium-term inflation rate  and that with only a couple of brief comments from the Reserve Bank. Of course  a sharp fall in the exchange rate is almost inevitably going to be associated with rising interest rates  since the fall is likely to prompt many investors to want to withdraw funds from New Zealand investments  and this inevitably leads to higher interest rates. But the fact that interest rates moved to keep the MCI broadly unchanged - certainly over the sharpest movements in the exchange rate - suggests that the system has worked well. For the record  I think the MCI is working at least as well as other approaches - better in some respects - and I am in no hurry to change it. Let me put this another way. I’m sure that if the Reserve Bank had not published an MCI actual monetary conditions would have evolved in a broadly similar way  but probably with more anguish. Without the early interest rate reaction  the exchange rate fall would have left monetary conditions very much looser than we wanted. We would then have had to move to recover the lost ground by tightening policy  probably requiring specific policy actions. In other words  the MCI is only an indicator. It isn’t driving events in a substantive way  so people BIS Review 78/1997 - 6 - blaming the MCI are misdirecting their complaints. Give me stick  if you want  for misreading inflationary pressures out there  but ‘don’t shoot the messenger’  for that’s all the MCI is. What of criticism that the Bank has been operating the MCI mechanistically  or robotically  and thus causing excessive volatility in financial markets? Should the Bank have been more willing than it has been to allow actual monetary conditions to diverge from its announced ‘desired’ conditions of 825  or  alternatively  should we have adjusted policy instruments to ensure that actual conditions kept within the plus or minus 50 points of 825 announced as ‘desired’ on 27 June? It is perhaps worth recalling what I said on 27 June  in releasing our latest Monetary Policy Statement: ‘It is clear that deviations from desired monetary conditions can be very large indeed without threatening either edge of our inflation target if those deviations are of relatively short duration. This suggests that the Bank should be relatively tolerant of quite large deviations from desired. On the other hand  large deviations  even for relatively short periods  may raise doubts - either about the Bank’s determination to achieve the inflation goals we have been set or about the possibility that the Bank  in accepting those large deviations  may have changed its view of desired conditions. These doubts can create uncertainty  and that uncertainty has real costs  both short-term and long-term. We already allow monetary conditions to move within a range  without reaction from the Bank  which is at least as wide as that allowed in other developed countries. I am reluctant to be too precise about how much deviation we are willing to accept and for how long. Much will depend on the circumstances in which the deviation occurs. We may  for example  be more tolerant of deviations which appear to arise out of sharp movements in overseas exchange rates  where local interest rates or exchange rates may take a brief period to adjust. We may be more tolerant of deviations during the weeks immediately preceding our next quarterly inflation projection  since it is at that time when our last comprehensive review of desired conditions is  by definition  getting most dated. We are likely to be less tolerant if monetary conditions change very rapidly  and appear to be building some momentum  without any obvious explanation in terms of overseas exchange rates or changed prospects for inflation. As a very approximate guideline  we would expect actual monetary conditions to be within a range of plus or minus 50 MCI points from desired in the weeks immediately following a comprehensive inflation projection. As more data comes to hand over the ensuing three months  and as our last comprehensive inflation projection recedes into history  we may be rather more tolerant. But this is not  repeat not  a binding rule which the market can expect us to follow under all circumstances  and those expecting us to do so are likely to be disappointed.’ That is what I said on 27 June  and looking back with the wisdom of hindsight I think the comments have stood the test of time rather well. Did we signal a tight band of plus or minus 50 points around ‘desired’? Hardly. On the contrary  we made it clear that we would judge monetary conditions in the light of emerging data  and the factors we believed were driving conditions. Should we therefore leap to change the target for settlement cash as soon as BIS Review 78/1997 - 7 - conditions stray by more than 50 points from the designated level? Absolutely not  and nobody should expect us to do so. My only regret is that I did not mention  as one reason for being tolerant of deviation of actual monetary conditions from desired monetary conditions  the complication created by a sharp change in the mix of conditions. Clearly  the Index is based on the assumption that a 1 percent movement in interest rates is equivalent  in medium-term effect  to a 2 percent change in the exchange rate  and that is our best estimate at this stage. But it is only an estimate  and we recognise that the relationship may well change over time and in response to very sharp movements in either interest or exchange rates. In the jargon  the relationship may not be linear. It is partly for this reason that we have been willing to accept quite a marked divergence between actual and desired conditions in recent weeks. It is important also to recall that  as indicated a moment ago  we can not control the mix of monetary conditions. This was very clearly indicated between September 1996 and March 1997. Over that period  90 day interest rates fell from around 10 percent to around 7.5 percent  while the exchange rate rose from around 66 on the Trade-Weighted Index to over 69. On the face of it  this period of rising exchange rate and falling interest rates was the very reverse of what might have been desirable - given that there was already little or no inflation in the export and import-competing sectors of the economy  and plenty of inflation in the domestic sectors - and I expressed my unhappiness about this mix on several occasions  all to no avail. For a whole host of reasons - perceptions of the likely trend of monetary policy in New Zealand and overseas  perhaps concerns about the balance of payments deficit  perhaps general concern about currencies in this part of the world - the mix has changed quite sharply in the last few months  with an increase in interest rates  which has taken them about half way back to where they were last September  and a sharp fall in the exchange rate. Overall  conditions have eased considerably  and I am sure that there won’t be an exporter in the country who is not a good deal happier with the present mix than with the one we had three or four months ago. But aren’t monetary conditions still too tight  given the low level of business and consumer confidence  the general flatness of the economy  and the fact that  on the Reserve Bank’s own figures  we will have inflation at or slightly below 1 percent by the end of this year and into 1998? In less than a month  the Bank will be publishing its next comprehensive inflation projection  so I don’t want to give a substantive answer to that at this stage. But let me just remind you of a couple of relevant points. It is hardly surprising  or a matter for regret  that our June Monetary Policy Statement projected that inflation would fall to 1 percent by the end of this year: through all of last year  until 10 December  we were targeting inflation at between 0 and 2 percent  with a mid-point of 1 percent  because that’s what our Policy Targets Agreement with the Government required at that time. We were battling to reduce inflation  which had been somewhat above the top of that range throughout 1996. Given that it takes a minimum of 12 months for monetary policy to have its impact on inflation  it would be surprising if inflation were not projected to be moving towards 1 percent at the end of this year. The inflation projection which the Bank published at the end of June was not only based on monetary conditions being around 825 on the MCI during the September 1997 quarter  it was also based on a particular combination of interest rates and exchange rate. We assumed that  during the September quarter  the trade-weighted exchange rate would average BIS Review 78/1997 - 8 - around 67.3  and 90 day interest rates would average around 7 percent. We also explicitly recognised that if the mix of conditions changed  the short-term track of inflation could be different. With the exchange rate in fact significantly lower than assumed in the June Monetary Policy Statement  and interest rates significantly higher than assumed  it is possible that the immediate inflation track may be a little higher than projected in June because of the impact which the lower New Zealand dollar may have on the prices of goods like television sets  cars  and other imports. In other words  a lower dollar may increase inflation more quickly than higher interest rates will reduce it. Although there are many people who feel that monetary conditions are inappropriately tight  and some who just feel that the combined wisdom of financial markets is more likely to be right than is the Reserve Bank  it is worth recalling that for the first four months of 1997  until the very end of April  financial markets kept monetary conditions appreciably tighter than the Bank had indicated was necessary or appropriate  despite our saying that we would be happier if conditions were somewhat easier. In other words  financial markets are not infallible. It is interesting that in the latest Consensus survey of New Zealand forecasters  representing views in mid-July 1997  39 percent felt that conditions were unduly firm  but 54 percent felt that they were about right - and conditions have eased somewhat since that survey was conducted. Monetary conditions have eased substantially over the last six or eight months - from an average of 1000 on the MCI in the December 1996 quarter to an average during the first half of August of 730. Put in more familiar terms  conditions have eased by the equivalent of a 2.7 percent fall in interest rates with unchanged exchange rate; or by the equivalent of a 5.4 percent fall in the exchange rate  with unchanged interest rates. This is a considerable easing in monetary conditions  which will not have its main effect on activity and inflation until well into 1998 - at about the time the economy is also experiencing a strong stimulus from reduced tax rates and increased government expenditure. In other words  the suggestion that the Reserve Bank has been braking the economy in recent months is factually wrong. In fact  over recent months the opposite is true. We will  of course  be weighing all these factors and more in reaching our judgement for the appropriate level of monetary conditions in the December quarter. We will publish our considered judgement on 18 September. Unfortunately  given the long lags between actions taken by the Reserve Bank today and the impact of those actions on inflation  nobody will know until at least the second half of next year whether we should have eased rather more in June 1997  or indeed whether we should have kept things a little firmer. Of one thing you can be certain. We will do everything in our power to keep inflation within the target which has been agreed with the Government. That will not guarantee you a profit in fruit-growing  or in exporting more generally. It will  however  be the best contribution which the Reserve Bank can make to the creation of an environment where you and others can make rational investment decisions  to the ultimate benefit of all New Zealanders.

This comparison is justified for at least two reasons: first  the causes of traffic accidents are essentially the same around the world  just like the causes of banking crises. It is therefore not surprising that almost all countries adopt the same type of rules  like speed limits in the case of traffic  or some kind of limitation of risk exposures in the case of banking. A second similarity between banking systems and traffic is that with the increase of cross-border activity  such as air traffic  the need for harmonisation of national regulations has grown. The minimum requirements for banking supervision which the Basle Committee has recently developed in conjunction with supervisors in emerging markets are an important step in this direction. Today  I would like to discuss with you the background  advantages and implementation of these core principles. Background l. Banking crises in countries are no new phenomena at all. In this part of the world a number of countries experienced severe banking problems in the early 1980s. In some western countries  notably in the Scandinavian  the banking community also faced substantial difficulties  albeit of a different nature. Since the Mexico crisis of 1995  awareness among policy-makers of the potential damage that can result from banking problems has grown significantly. In emerging markets  banking problems often result in much deeper recessions than in industrialised countries. Generally  these economies are more vulnerable to banking problems because almost all financial intermediation is carried out by banks. Most industrialised countries are less dependent on banks  because the function of financial intermediation is also performed by institutional investors and well-developed capital markets. Since the Mexico crisis  it has also been recognised that the frequency of banking problems is significantly higher in emerging markets. Recent research has shown that 85% of the severe banking crises which have occurred in the past fifteen years concerned developing and transition economies. My explanation for this striking fact is that the factors which cause banking crises are generally more prevalent  but not essentially different in emerging markets than in industrialised countries. This basic idea is the rationale behind the common set of core principles I would like to discuss with you today. 2. But before that a short word on the way the principles have been developed because it shows an important development in the cooperation between the members of the Basle Committee and other countries. The principles were first drafted by a joint working group consisting of a number of Basle Committee members and representatives from 15 other countries. Subsequently a very lively exchange of views took place in a meeting in Basle in March of this year in which representatives of approximately 40 countries  including the chairmen of all regional groups  participated. To my satisfaction the consultation period following that meeting produced a large number of reactions  nearly all of them favourable. These reactions will be incorporated in the core principles. To endorse the final text of the principles  a similar meeting to the one in March will take place on September 10th in Basle. Two weeks later  in conjunction with the annual meeting in Hong Kong  the IMF and the Basle Committee will co-sponsor a conference to introduce the principles to as wide as possible an audience of Ministries of Finance and central banks. BIS Review 79/1997 - 2 - As I said  the main rational behind the core principles has been the increased 3. awareness among policy-makers that banking crises can aggravate recessions. Another reason for the formulation of core principles is the increased globalisation of economic activity. With the strong growth of trade and financial flows between national economies  banking problems in one country have much more potential to spread to other parts of the world. A specific form of globalisation concerns the increasing international activities of large banks. Policy makers generally welcome cross-border banking  because of the beneficial effects on the efficiency  liquidity and depth of financial markets. However  the internationalisation of banking also increases the risk of contagion of banking problems. In order to reduce this risk  the core principles pay special attention to the supervision of cross-border banking. On this subject  the most important message from the core principles is that home country supervisors should practise consolidated supervision over their internationally-active banks. In order to enable home country supervisors to fulfil this task most effectively  host country supervisors must share information with them about the local operations of foreign banks. Finally  the core principles state that banking supervisors must require the local operations of foreign banks to meet the same high standards as are required of domestic institutions. Advantages 4. You may wonder whether the core principles will really be able to reduce the severity and frequency of banking problems around the world. Let me try to answer this question by reviewing the main causes of banking crises and the way in which the core principles deal with these causes. One important cause of banking crises is macro-economic instability. High and variable inflation rates  booms and busts in economic activity and exchange rate volatility complicate credit assessments by banks. Moreover  during the expansion phase of a business cycle  there is often a tendency towards over-optimism and excessive lending by banks  which in turn can result in asset price bubbles. This factor can be regarded as the main cause of the current fragility of the Japanese financial sector. Thus  inadequate risk management by banks is frequently a crucial link between macro-economic instability and banking problems. Macro-economic instability is on average greater in emerging markets  reflecting less diversification and greater structural rigidities. Unsound fiscal and monetary policies can add further to this problem. As a consequence  the risks faced by banks in emerging markets tend to be higher. 5. The core principles formulate prudential regulations and requirements in order to promote a framework to control the risks inherent in banking. The application of this framework can limit the negative influence of macro-economic volatility on the soundness of the financial system. The requirements concerned cover capital adequacy  loan loss reserves  asset concentrations  liquidity  risk management and internal controls. Of this group of principles  I think those regarding risk management and internal controls deserve special attention. For example  core principles 12 and 13 state that banking supervisors must be satisfied that banks have in place risk management systems which accurately identify  measure  monitor and control market risks and all other material risks. Furthermore  banks are required to hold an adequate amount of capital against these risks. These principles reflect the growing recognition that banks bear the principal responsibility for adequate risk management themselves. The main task of supervisors is to set minimum standards and to monitor the policies and procedures through which banks control their risks. 6. I would like to emphasise that adequate risk management by banks can reduce but not eliminate the negative effects of macro-economic instability on the soundness of financial systems. But it is evident that a sound financial sector is an important precondition for BIS Review 79/1997 - 3 - macroeconomic stability. For instance  when macro-economic stabilisation calls for monetary tightening  concerns about the effect of higher interest rates on the loan portfolios of weak banks may delay policy action. In Mexico  this delay contributed to a sudden reversal of capital flows and a deep recession to macro-economic instability underscore the need for the application of the core principles. in 1995. These so-called feedback effects from financial 7. The second main cause of financial fragility is premature financial liberalisation. It is widely recognised that financial liberalisation promotes competition among banks  thereby improving the efficient allocation of financial resources in the long run. However  during the transition  bank managers and supervisors often lack the expertise to deal with the higher risks associated with the new activities in which their institutions get involved. This lack of experience increases the probability of banking crises. Moreover  increased competition from foreign banks often encourages domestic banks to finance riskier investments in order to keep up their earnings. This chain of events has unfolded not only in emerging economies  but also in well-developed Nordic countries and the United States. Policy makers have drawn an important lesson from these banking crises  namely that financial liberalisation should be preceded by a strengthening of risk management systems by banks. The core principles regarding risk management and internal controls which I have just discussed can serve as a guide for the supervision of the risk management systems adopted by banks. 8. The third culprit is government involvement in banking. One way in which government policy can undermine the soundness of banks is by means of the tax treatment of financial institutions. For example  tax systems which do not allow the deduction of loan loss provisions from taxable earnings reduce the incentive of banks to recognise these losses on a timely basis. A perhaps more damaging way of government involvement is the use of state banks to finance government expenditures at below market rates. This channel has two apparent advantages to the government; for one thing  it is cheap  at least in the short run. In addition  bank financing does not show up in the official measurements of the budget deficit  which reduces the possibilities for public scrutiny. Although state-owned banks are most prone to this kind of political exploitation  privately-owned banks can also function as quasi-fiscal agents  for example when they are forced to lend to particular sectors or industries. Obviously  these financing practices reduce the viability of banks in the medium and long term. 9. I would point out that  while political involvement in banking tends to occur more frequently in developing countries  it is not restricted to them. In South Korea and France  for example  recent banking problems seem to be linked at least in part to government involvement. However  in less wealthy countries the pressure on government funds is usually larger  which increases the temptation to turn to state banks for funding. The risk of government influence on banks in emerging markets is also larger  because state banks tend to control a much bigger share of banking assets. 10. Core principle l contains a description of the preconditions for effective banking supervision. In the context of problems related to government involvement  the following elements of this first principle seem particularly relevant. First  the explanation of core principle 1 says that each supervisory agency should possess operational independence to pursue a sound banking system free from political pressure. A second important precondition is that each supervisory agency should have adequate resources to meet the objectives set. These resources should be provided on terms that do not undermine the autonomy and independence of the supervisory agency. The emphasis of the first core principle on the independence of supervisory agencies is important  first of all because independent supervisors are in a better position to prevent political exploitation of banks. And secondly because it can limit forbearance BIS Review 79/1997 - 4 - in dealing with problems in individual banks. A number of banking crises could have been prevented or alleviated if the supervisory authorities would have had the independence and the instruments to intervene in a timely and adequate way. In addition  the appendix of the core principles explicitly mentions the need for supervisors to apply their supervisory methods in the same manner to government-owned commercial banks as to other commercial banks. The implementation of this advice should also reduce the opportunities for governments to use state banks as a source of cheap funding. ll. A related cause of banking problems is connected lending  which refers to loans extended to banks’ managers  shareholders or to parties connected to them. Just like loans to governments  loans to connected parties are often granted on a non-arm’s length basis and at below market rates. Another similarity with government involvement is that there is reason to believe that connected lending is a more serious problem in emerging than in advanced economies. The risks of connected lending encompass a lack of objectivity in credit assessment and undue concentration of credit risk. Core principle 10 explicitly addresses the problem of connected lending. This principle states that banking supervisors must have in place requirements that banks lend to related companies and individuals on an arm’s length basis  that such extensions of credit are effectively monitored  and that other appropriate steps are taken to control or mitigate the risks. Moreover  core principle 9 calls for prudential limits to restrict bank exposures to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. If these principles are implemented on a global scale  they will raise a significant barrier against connected lending. 12. I now turn to a fourth set of causes of banking problems  that can be labelled inadequate corporate governance. This term refers to an absence of the right incentive structure for bank owners  managers  depositors and supervisors to show prudent behaviour. Perhaps the best way to throw light on these types of problems is by means of a well-known example  namely the downfall of the US savings and loans institutions. In the early 1980s  the supervisory authorities in the US sought ways to enable savings and loans institutions  which were generally in bad shape  to continue in business. The range of activities in which these institutions were permitted to engage was expanded  capital standards were relaxed and the level of deposit insurance was increased. As a consequence  many savings and loans institutions tried to grow out of their problems by investing in high-risk assets  such as property and so-called ‘junk bonds’. The point is that depositors were content to finance these risky investments  because of the generosity of the US deposit insurance at that time. Moreover  with low capital standards  equity holders or owners had little to lose. Finally  banking regulation in the US did not penalise bank managers for excessive risk-taking and allowed supervisors to delay corrective measures. When the property market started to collapse in the mid-eighties  many savings and loans institutions became insolvent  which eventually resulted in a loss of at least $150 billion for the US taxpayers. In order to prevent similar banking problems  bank regulation in advanced and emerging economies must incorporate the right incentives for all participants in the banking system. If you look at the core principles you will find various sorts of incentives in this 13. field. Firstly  principle 3 requires that the licensing process should consist of  among other things  an assessment of the bank’s ownership structure as well as of its directors and senior management. The explanation of this principle makes clear that if the supervisory agency doubts the integrity and standing of a bank’s owner or manager  it should have the authority to prevent a specific ownership structure or the appointment of a certain bank manager. In this way  past imprudent behaviour of bank owners and managers is penalised by excluding them from responsible functions in the banking sector. BIS Review 79/1997 - 5 - Secondly  core principle 6 prescribes that capital requirements for banks should 14. be no less than those established in the so-called Basle Capital Accord. The Basle Accord sets minimum capital requirements of 8% of the risk-adjusted assets of banks. Bank capital essentially serves three functions; it is a base for further growth  it provides a cushion against exceptional losses and it promotes better governance. The governance function relates to the fact that if shareholders have more money at stake  they have stronger incentives to ensure that banks are managed in a safe and sound manner. Regarding the loss-absorption function of capital  it must be stressed that the Basle capital requirements are considered a minimum standard. In emerging economies  higher minimum capital requirements seem appropriate  because banks there usually operate in a more volatile and therefore riskier environment. I therefore welcome the initiatives of the supervisory authorities in Argentina and Colombia  who have already raised their minimum capital requirements to 11.5 and 9% respectively. 15. As the example of the US thrift crisis showed  the design of deposit insurance deserves special attention. The second appendix of the core principles contains a balanced view on this delicate issue  which can be summarised as follows: On the one hand  deposit insurance is desirable because it limits the effect that problems at one bank might have on other banks. This obviously increases the stability of the financial system. However  deposit insurance can also increase the risk of imprudent behaviour by banks  because depositors will be less inclined to withdraw funds even if the bank pursues high-risk strategies. Therefore  governments should incorporate mechanisms in the system of depositor protection that prevent excessive risk-taking by banks. This can for example be achieved by a partial deposit insurance  so that depositors still have funds at risk. Another method is withholding deposit insurance from large  institutional investors. The precise form of such a program should be tailored to the specific circumstances of each country. 16. The last item on my list of crisis factors is a poor market infrastructure. It is widely accepted that imperfect accounting systems  limited disclosure practices and inadequate legal frameworks can hinder effective banking supervision and market discipline. Again  these deficiencies are more pronounced in developing countries  but deserve continuous efforts for improvement in developed countries as well. The first problem concerns the accuracy of accounting systems. In many countries  the accounting standards for classifying bank loans as non-performing are not tight enough to prevent banks from making bad loans look good. If non-performing loans are systematically understated and are not properly provided against  figures about profitability and bank capital become meaningless. On the disclosure side  the ability to distinguish healthy from unhealthy banks is often hampered by the absence of financial statements on a consolidated basis. Differences in accounting standards across countries and the absence of serious penalties for publishing inaccurate information can also obstruct a meaningful assessment of banks. Finally  the legal system sometimes impedes prudent banking  for example when it hinders banks to seize collateral behind delinquent loans. 17. Core principle 21 relates to the information requirements of bank organisations  which is an important part of the market infrastructure. This principle states that banking supervisors must be satisfied that each bank maintains adequate records drawn up in accordance with consistent accounting policies and practices. This information should enable supervisors to obtain a true and fair view of the financial condition and profitability of banks. Banks should also publish financial statements that fairly reflect their condition on a regular basis. Moreover. the explanation of this principle prescribes that if a bank provides false or misleading information  supervisory action or criminal prosecution should be taken against the individuals involved and the institution. BIS Review 79/1997 - 6 - Having elaborated on the contribution that the core principles can make towards 18. alleviating the main causes of banking problems  I think it is now time for an overall assessment. First of all  it would be an illusion to think that a global application of the core principles can by itself prevent financial crises occurring in the future. As I already mentioned with regard to capital standards  the core principles contain minimum requirements. Individual countries  particularly those in emerging areas  should therefore consider to what extent they need to supplement the core principles with requirements addressing particular risks of their financial systems. Moreover  banking supervision is a dynamic function that needs to respond to changes in the marketplace. Therefore  the principles will need periodic  but not necessarily frequent  refinement and readjustment. Finally  the core principles provide guidelines for bank regulation. I hope my description of the causes of financial crises has made clear that financial stability not only requires prudential behaviour by banks  but also macro-economic stability  a transparent government budget and an adequate legal framework. In these areas  which all have to do with government policy  the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund can make an important contribution to financial stability. Implementation In the near future  the implementation of the core principles should be a top 19. priority. Of course the main burden of this lies with the governments of the individual countries. I don’t underestimate the wide-ranging legal  infrastructural and educational changes the implementation of the principles call for in a large number of countries. Every country should put in place an ambitious program with clear time-frames for the implementation. It is obvious that the IMF and the World Bank should have a leading role with regard to monitoring the implementation of the core principles. The main argument for this structure is that the international financial institutions already send missions to almost all countries in the world. However  it is generally acknowledged that the Basle Committee possesses great expertise in bank regulation. I therefore plead for a model in which the Basle Committee  the IMF and the World Bank each and together assist countries in realising financial stability in their respective fields of competence. In this model  the IMF and the World Bank are primarily responsible for creating a sound environment for banking  which is highly dependent on viable government policies. As part of the assessment of government policies  these institutions will of course also pay attention to the quality of bank supervision. The Basle Committee is primarily responsible for 20. the amendment and interpretation of the principles and will review compliance with the principles at the International Conference of Banking Supervisors in October 1998 and bi-annually thereafter. The Basle Committee can furthermore make a major contribution towards the implementation of the principles by offering technical assistance and courses to supervisors in emerging countries. In this respect  banking and traffic again look alike. It is all a matter of knowing your responsibility; if you do not make a timely agreement about who drives home  you both end up drinking too much. BIS Review 79/1997

The Center  by encouraging academic research into public policy and bringing that research to the attention of policymakers  is performing a most valuable role in our society. I am particularly pleased that Milton Friedman has taken time to join us. His views have had as much  if not more  impact on the way we think about monetary policy and many other important economic issues as those of any person in the last half of the twentieth century. Federal Reserve policy  over the years  has been subject to criticism  often with justification  from Professor Friedman and others. It has been argued  for example  that policy failed to anticipate the emerging inflation of the 1970s  and by fostering excessive monetary creation  contributed to the inflationary upsurge. Surely  it was maintained  some monetary policy rule  however imperfect  would have delivered far superior performance. Even if true in this case  though  policy rules might not always be preferable. Policy rules  at least in a general way  presume some understanding of how economic forces work. Moreover  in effect  they anticipate that key causal connections observed in the past will remain fixed over time  or evolve only very slowly. Use of a rule presupposes Another premise behind many rule-based policy prescriptions  however  is that our knowledge of the full workings of the system is quite limited  so that attempts to improve on the results of policy rules will  on average  only make matters worse. In this view  ad hoc or discretionary policy can cause uncertainty for private decision makers and be wrong for extended periods if there is no anchor to bring it back into line. In addition  discretionary policy is obviously vulnerable to political pressures; if ad hoc judgments are to be made  why shouldn’t those of elected representatives supersede those of unelected officials? The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has involved varying degrees of rule- and discretionary-based modes of operation over time. Recognizing the potential drawbacks of purely discretionary policy  the Federal Reserve frequently has sought to exploit past patterns and regularities to operate in a systematic way. But we have found that very often historical regularities have been disrupted by unanticipated change  especially in technologies. The evolving patterns mean that the performance of the economy under any rule  were it to be rigorously followed  would deviate from expectations. Accordingly we are constantly evaluating how much we can infer from the past and how relationships might have changed. In an ever changing world  some element of discretion appears to be an unavoidable aspect of policymaking. Such changes mean that we can never construct a completely general model of the economy  invariant through time  on which to base our policy. Still  sensible policy does presuppose a conceptual framework  or implicit model  however incompletely specified  of how the economic system operates. Of necessity  we make judgments based importantly on historical BIS Review 79/1997 - 2 - regularities in behavior inferred from data relationships. These perceived regularities can be embodied in formal empirical models  often covering only a portion of the economic system. Generally  the regularities inform our interpretation of “experience” and tell us what to look for to determine whether history is in the process of repeating itself  and if not  why not. From such an examination  along with an assessment of past policy actions  we attempt to judge to what extent our current policies should deviate from our past patterns of behavior. When this Center was founded 15 years ago  the rules versus discretion debate focused on the appropriate policy role of the monetary aggregates  and this discussion was echoed in the Federal Reserve’s policy process. In the late 1970s  the Federal Reserve’s actions to deal with developing inflationary instabilities were shaped in part by the reality portrayed by Milton Friedman’s analysis that ever-rising inflation rate peaks  as well as ever-rising inflation rate troughs  followed on the heels of similar patterns of average money growth. The Federal Reserve  in response to such evaluations  acted aggressively under newly installed Chairman Paul Volcker. A considerable tightening of the average stance of policy -- based on intermediate M1 targets tied to reserve operating objectives -- eventually reversed the surge in inflation. The last fifteen years have been a period of consolidating the gains of the early 1980s and extending them to their logical end -- the achievement of price stability. We are not quite there yet  but we trust it is on the horizon. Although the ultimate goals of policy have remained the same over these past fifteen years  the techniques used in formulating and implementing policy have changed considerably as a consequence of vast changes in technology and regulation. Focusing on M1  and following operating procedures that imparted a considerable degree of automaticity to short-term interest rate movements  was extraordinarily useful in the early Volcker years. But after nationwide NOW accounts were introduced  the demand for M1 in the judgment of the Federal Open Market Committee became too interest-sensitive for that aggregate to be useful in implementing policy. Because the velocity of such an aggregate varies substantially in response to small changes in interest rates  target ranges for M1 growth in its judgment no longer were reliable guides for outcomes in nominal spending and inflation. In response to an unanticipated movement in spending and hence the quantity of money demanded  a small variation in interest rates would be sufficient to bring money back to path but not to correct the deviation in spending. As a consequence  by late 1982  M1 was de-emphasized and policy decisions per force became more discretionary. However  in recognition of the longer-run relationship of prices and M2  especially its stable long-term velocity  this broader aggregate was accorded more weight  along with a variety of other indicators  in setting our policy stance. As an indicator  M2 served us well for a number of years. But by the early 1990s  its usefulness was undercut by the increased attractiveness and availability of alternative outlets for saving  such as bond and stock mutual funds  and by mounting financial difficulties for depositories and depositors that led to a restructuring of business and household balance sheets. The apparent result was a significant rise in the velocity of M2  which was especially unusual given continuing declines in short-term market interest rates. By 1993  this extraordinary velocity behavior had become so pronounced that the Federal Reserve was forced to begin disregarding the signals M2 was sending  at least for the time being. BIS Review 79/1997 - 3 - Data since mid-1994 do seem to show the re-emergence of a relationship of M2 with nominal income and short-term interest rates similar to that experienced during the three decades of the 1960s through the 1980s. As I indicated to the Congress recently  however  the period of predictable velocity is too brief to justify restoring M2 to its role of earlier years  though clearly persistent outsized changes would get our attention. Increasingly since 1982 we have been setting the funds rate directly in response to a wide variety of factors and forecasts. We recognize that  in fixing the short-term rate  we lose much of the information on the balance of money supply and demand that changing market rates afford  but for the moment we see no alternative. In the current state of our knowledge  money demand has become too difficult to predict. Although our operating target is a nominal short-term rate  we view its linkages to spending and prices as indirect and complex. For one  arguably  it is real  not nominal  rates that are more relevant to spending. For another  spending  prices and other economic variables respond to a whole host of financial variables. Hence  in judging the stance of policy we routinely look at the financial impulses coming from foreign exchange  bond  and equity markets  along with supply conditions in credit markets generally  including at financial intermediaries. Nonetheless  we fundamentally a monetary phenomenon  and ultimately determined by the growth of the stock of money  not by nominal or real interest rates. In current circumstances  however  determining which financial data should be aggregated to provide an appropriate empirical proxy for the money stock that tracks income and spending represents a severe challenge for monetary analysts. recognize inflation that is The absence of a monetary aggregate anchor  however  has not left policy completely adrift. From a longer-term perspective we have been guided by a firm commitment to contain any forces that would undermine economic expansion and efficiency by raising inflation  and we have kept our focus firmly on the ultimate goal of achieving price stability. Within that framework we have attempted not only to lean against the potential for an overheating economy  but also to cushion shortfalls in economic growth. And  recognizing the lags in the effects of policy  we have tried to move in anticipation of such disequilibria developing. But this is a very general framework and does not present clear guidance for day-to-day policy decisions. Thus  as the historic relationship between measured money supply and spending deteriorated  policymaking  seeing no alternative  turned more eclectic and discretionary. Nonetheless  we try to develop as best we can a stable conceptual framework  so policy actions are as regular and predictable as possible -- that is  governed by systematic behavior but open to evidence of structural macroeconomic changes that require policy to adapt. The application of such an approach is illustrated by a number of disparate events we have confronted since 1982 that were in some important respects outside our previous experience. In the early and mid-1980s  the FOMC faced most notably the sharp swings in fiscal policy  the unprecedented rise and fall of the dollar  and the associated shifts in international trade and capital flows. But I will concentrate on several events of the last decade where I personally participated in forming the judgments used in policy implementation. BIS Review 79/1997 - 4 - One such event was the stock market crash of October 1987 shortly after I arrived. Unlike many uncertain situations that have confronted monetary policy  there was little question that the appropriate central bank action was to ease policy significantly. We knew we would soon have to sop up the excess liquidity that we added to the system  but the timing and  I believe  the magnitude of our actions were among our easier decisions. Our concerns at that time reflected questions about how the financial markets and the economy would respond to the shock of a decline of more than one-fifth in stock prices in one day  and whether monetary policy alone could stabilize the system. By the early spring of 1988 it was evident that the economy had stabilized and we needed to begin reversing the easy stance of policy. Another development that confronted policy was the commercial property price bust of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Since a large volume of bank and thrift loans was tied to the real estate market and backed by real estate collateral  the fall in property prices impaired the capital of a large number of depositories. These institutions reacted by curtailing new lending -- the unprecedented “credit crunch” of 1990 and 1991. Not unexpectedly  our policy response was to move toward significant ease. Our primary concern was the state of the credit markets and the economy  but we could also see that these broader issues were linked inextricably to the state of depository institutions’ balance sheets and profitability. A satisfactory recovery from the recession of that period  in our judgment  required the active participation of a viable banking system. The extraordinary circumstances dictated a highly unusual path for monetary policy. The stance of policy eased substantially even after the economy began to recover from the 1990-91 recession  and a stimulative policy was deliberately maintained well into the early expansion period. By mid-1993  however  property prices stabilized and the credit crunch gradually began to dissipate. It was clear as the year moved toward a close that monetary policy  characterized by a real federal funds rate of virtually zero  was now far too easy in light of the strengthening economy on the horizon. Financial and economic conditions were returning to more traditional relationships  and policy had to shift from a situation-specific formulation to one based more closely on previous historical patterns. Although it was difficult at that time to discern any overt inflationary signals  the balance of risks  in our judgment  clearly dictated pre-emptive action. The 1994 to 1995 period was most instructive. It appears we were successful in moving pre-emptively to throttle down an impending unstable boom  which almost surely would have resulted in the current expansion coming to an earlier halt. Because this was the first change in the stance of policy after a prolonged period of unusual ease  we took special care to spell out our analysis and expectations for policy in an unusually explicit way to inform the markets well before we began to tighten. In addition  we began for the first time to issue explanatory statements as changes in the stance of policy were implemented. Even so  the idea of tightening to head off inflation before it was visible in the data was not universally applauded or perhaps understood. Financial markets reacted unusually strongly to our 1994 policy actions  often ratcheting up their expectations for further rate increases when we actually tightened  resulting in very large increases in longer-term interest rates. At the time  these reactions seemed to reflect the extent to which investment strategies had been counting on a persistence of low interest rates. This was a classic case in which we had to be careful not to allow market expectations of Federal Reserve actions to be major elements of policy determination. We are always concerned about assuming that short-term movements in market prices are reflections of changes in BIS Review 79/1997 - 5 - underlying supply and demand conditions when we may be observing nothing more than fluctuating expectations about our own policy actions. Most recently  the economy has demonstrated a remarkable confluence of robust growth  high resource utilization  and damped inflation. Once again we have been faced with analyzing and reacting to a situation in which incoming data have not readily conformed to historical experience. Specifically  the persistence of rising profit margins in the face of stable or falling inflation raises the question of what is happening to productivity. If data on profits and prices are even approximately accurate  total consolidated corporate unit costs have  of necessity  been materially contained. With labor costs constituting three-fourths of costs  unless growth in compensation per hour is falling  which seems most unlikely from other information  it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that output per hour has to be rising at a pace significantly in excess of the officially published annual growth rate of nonfarm productivity of one percent over recent quarters. The degree to which these data may be understated is underlined by backing out from the total what appears to be a reasonably accurate  or at least consistent  measure of productivity of corporate businesses. The level of nonfarm noncorporate productivity implied by this exercise has been falling continuously since 1973 despite reasonable earnings margins for proprietorships and partnerships. Presumably this reflects the significant upward bias in our measurement of service prices  which dominate our noncorporate sector. Nonetheless  the still open question is whether productivity growth is in the process of picking up. For it is the answer to this question that is material to the current debate between those who argue that the economy is entering a “new era” of greatly enhanced sustainable growth and unusually high levels of resource utilization  and those who do not. A central bank  while needing to be open to evidence of structural economic change  also needs to be cautious. Supplying excess liquidity to support growth that turns out to have been ephemeral would undermine the very good economic performance we have enjoyed. We raised the federal funds rate in March to help protect against this latter possibility  and with labor resources currently stretched tight  we need to remain on alert. Whatever its successes  the current monetary policy regime is far from ideal. Each episode has had to be treated as unique or nearly so. It may have been the best we could do at the moment. But we continuously examine alternatives that might better anchor policy  so that it becomes less subject to the abilities of the Federal Open Market Committee to analyze developments and make predictions. Gold was such an anchor or rule  prior to World War I  but it was first compromised and eventually abandoned because it restrained the type of discretionary monetary and fiscal policies that modern democracies appear to value. A fixed  or even adaptive  rule on the expansion of the monetary base would anchor the system  but it is hard to envision acceptance for that approach because it also limits economic policy discretion. Moreover  flows of U.S. currency abroad  which are variable and difficult to estimate  and bank reserves avoidance are subverting any relationship that might have existed between growth in the monetary base and U.S. economic performance. BIS Review 79/1997 - 6 - Another type of rule using readings on output and prices to help guide monetary policy  such as John Taylor’s  has attracted widening interest in recent years in the financial markets  the academic community  and at central banks. Taylor-type rules or reaction functions have a number of attractive features. They assume that central banks can appropriately pay attention simultaneously to developments in both output and inflation  provided their reactions occur in the context of a longer-run goal of price stability and that they recognize that activity is limited by the economy’s sustainable potential. As Taylor himself has pointed out  these types of formulations are at best “guideposts” to help central banks  not inflexible rules that eliminate discretion. One reason is that their formulation depends on the values of certain key variables -- most crucially the equilibrium real federal funds rate and the production potential of the economy. In practice these have been obtained by observation of past macroeconomic behavior -- either through informal inspection of the data  or more formally as embedded in models. In that sense  like all rules  as I noted earlier  they embody a forecast that the future will be like the past. Unfortunately  however  history is not an infallible guide to the future  and the levels of these two variables are currently under active debate. The mechanics of monetary policy that I have been addressing are merely means to an end. What are we endeavoring to achieve  and why? The goal of macroeconomic policy should be maximum sustainable growth over the long term  and evidence has continued to accumulate around the world that price stability is a necessary condition for the achievement of that goal. Beyond this very general statement  however  lie difficult issues of concept and measurement for policymakers and academicians to keep us occupied for the next fifteen years and more. Inflation impairs economic efficiency in part because people have difficulty separating movements in relative prices from movements in the general price level. But what prices matter? Certainly prices of goods and services now being produced -- our basic measure of inflation -- matter. But what about prices of claims on future goods and services  like equities  real estate or other earning assets? Is stability in the average level of these prices essential to the stability of the economy? Recent Japanese economic history only underlines the difficulty and importance of this question. The prices of final goods and services were stable in Japan in the mid-to-late 1980s  but soaring asset prices distorted resource allocation and ultimately undermined the performance of the macroeconomy. In the United States  evaluating the effects on the economy of shifts in balance sheets and variations in asset prices has been an integral part of the development of monetary policy. In recent years  for example  we have expended considerable effort to understand the implications of changes in household balance sheets in the form of high and rising consumer debt burdens and increases in market wealth from the run-up in the stock market. And the equity market itself has been the subject of analysis as we attempt to assess the implications for financial and economic stability of the extraordinary rise in equity prices -- a rise based apparently on continuing upward revisions in estimates of our corporations’ already robust long-term earning prospects. But  unless they are moving together  prices of assets and of goods and services cannot both be an objective of a particular monetary policy  which  after all  has one effective instrument -- the short-term interest rate. We have chosen product prices as our BIS Review 79/1997 - 7 - primary focus on the grounds that stability in the average level of these prices is likely to be consistent with financial stability as well as maximum sustainable growth. History  however  is somewhat ambiguous on the issue of whether central banks can safely ignore asset markets  except as they affect product prices. Over the coming decades  moreover  what constitutes product price and  hence  price stability will itself become harder to measure. When industrial product was the centerpiece of the economy during the first two-thirds of this century  our overall price indexes served us well. Pricing a pound of electrolytic copper presented few definitional problems. The price of a ton of cold rolled steel sheet  or a linear yard of cotton broad woven fabrics  could be reasonably compared over a period of years. I have already noted the problems in defining price and output and  hence  in measuring productivity over the past twenty years. The simple notion of price has turned decidedly complex. What is the price of a unit of software or of a medical procedure? How does one evaluate the price change of a cataract operation over a ten-year period when the nature of the procedure and its impact on the patient has been altered so radically? The pace of change and the shifting to harder-to-measure types of output are more likely to quicken than to slow down. Indeed  how will we measure inflation in the future when our data -- using current techniques -- could become increasingly less adequate to trace price trends over time? However  so long as individuals make contractual arrangements for future payments valued in dollars and other currencies  there must be a presumption on the part of those involved in the transaction about the future purchasing power of money. No matter how complex individual products become  there will always be some general sense of the purchasing power of money both across time and across goods and services. Hence  we must assume that embodied in all products is some unit of output  and hence of price  that is recognizable to producers and consumers and upon which they will base their decisions. The emergence of inflation-indexed bonds does not solve the problem of pinning down an economically meaningful measure of the general price level. While there is  of course  an inflation expectation premium embodied in all nominal interest rates  it is fundamentally unobservable. Returns on indexed bonds are tied to forecasts of specific published price indexes  which may or may not reflect the market’s judgment of the future purchasing power of money. To the extent they do not  of course  the implicit real interest rate is biased in the opposite direction. Doubtless  we will develop new techniques of measurement to unearth those true prices as the years go on. It is crucial that we do  for inflation can destabilize an economy even if faulty price indexes fail to reveal it. It should be evident from my remarks that ample challenges will continue to face monetary policy. I have concentrated on how we have tried to identify and analyze new developments  and endeavored to use that analysis to fashion and balance policy responses. I have also tried to highlight the questions about how to specify and measure the ultimate goals of policy. Nonetheless  all of us could easily add to the list. In dealing with these issues  policy can only benefit from focused and relevant academic research. I look forward to learning about and utilizing the contributions made under the sponsorship of the Center for Economic Policy Research over the years to come. BIS Review 79/1997

This seemingly statement encompasses much of what practical  operational macro-economics is about: how to raise the trend; and how to reduce fluctuations around this trend. innocuous This talk focuses on what monetary policy might do to reduce fluctuations around the trend. The Governor spoke only a few weeks ago about what monetary policy might do for growth (Macfarlane 1997). In a nutshell  price stability will be generally helpful to long-term growth because it ensures resources are deployed more efficiently  but the main sources of growth are to be found in increases in labour inputs and productivity. What about monetary policy and the cycle? The starting point is that life would be more comfortable all around if the cyclical swings are not too big and if the bumps in various parts of the economy are not too coincident. It seems likely  too  that however convenient it is analytically to separate trend from fluctuations  there will be a link between the cycle and either the level of GDP or its trend growth rate. If the severity of the downturns is reduced and the economy operates with a smaller output gap  then the level of income over time is  on average  higher. As well  big swings (such as 1982 and 1990) risk hysteresis: the process of winding unemployment down again has proved to be slow and difficult. Is there anything to be said on the other side of the argument? You will recall the Schumpeterian argument that cycles have some cathartic  cleansing function. I have more faith in competition to ensure that the benefit of technology is introduced as quickly as it should be  and so I do not see a vital need for the Schumpeterian cleansing process. But  in any case  however successful policy may be  enough of a cycle seems likely to remain  in order to ensure the Schumpeterian process has the opportunity to take place.1 So let us take as given that it is desirable to have as little cycle as possible  and examine two aspects of this. First  the role of monetary policy in the cycle  and secondly  how the cycle may have changed over time to alter the way monetary policy impinges on the cycle. Characteristics of monetary policy A thumb-nail sketch of history serves as a reminder that the role of monetary policy in the cycle has been the subject of changing views over the years. • For the first couple of decades of this century  the gold standard was the undisputed centre-point of monetary policy  anchoring prices. Income smoothing was not an objective of monetary policy. The result -- unsurprisingly -- was that price level stability was maintained (in the sense David Gruen  John Hawkins and Amanda Thornton helped greatly in the preparation of this paper. The * usual disclaimer applies. 1 To explore the issues raised by Real Business Cycle theory  with its implication that cycles are the result of optimal responses to supply-side shocks  would take us too far afield here. Let me put my biases on the record by agreeing with Solow’s comment: “This explanation has been an empirical failure  or at best a non-success” (Solow 1997  p. 230). BIS Review 80/1997 - 2 - that there was a longer-term anchor which forced the price level back towards its starting point)  but there was considerable variation (both in prices and in output) in the short term. • The Depression forced a re-appraisal  but fiscal policy became the instrument to smooth the fluctuations in output -- monetary policy was seen to be caught in the infamous liquidity trap. This idea has not entirely disappeared  and the notion of “pushing on a string” still has currency. • Somewhere in the ensuing decade or two  monetary policy emerged as a counter-cyclical co-player  on a par with fiscal policy. There was no particular  specialised difference between monetary policy and fiscal policy (at least in the eyes of most policy-makers) -- inflation control and cyclical smoothing were more or less the same task. Inevitably  in time  the attempt was made to squeeze more out of the Phillips curve trade-off than was available. • By the 1970s  a clear specialisation had developed (most precisely enunciated in the academic literature  but reflected also in operational monetary policy). The over-use of the Keynesian tools had unanchored price expectations  and the OPEC oil price shock contributed to the reassessment. Most central banks in industrial countries adopted a monetary target  specifically aimed at achieving price stability. • The high water of this monetarist view occurred around 1980. Over the next five years  it rapidly lost its pivotal role  because the key relationship in this view-of-the-world broke down -- the relationship between money and nominal income turned out to be unstable.2 With the breakdown of the anchor of a stable money demand function  practitioners were forced to look elsewhere. In our own case  it has taken us  eventually  to an inflation target. But others have put forward the view that monetary policy should only care about price stability  without any direct concern with output. The origins of this can be found in Friedman’s monetarism (he was  of course  concerned above all with price stability). It seems only a minor elision to slip from monetarism to a single objective for monetary policy. But the point to note here is that the old monetary rules had an important element of income smoothing built into them -- when output slowed in the course of the cycle  money supply rules produced a more-or-less automatic easing of monetary policy  because the central relationship was between money and nominal income. As the stability of the monetary demand relationship broke down  it would have been logical enough to focus on the next link of the causal chain  and replace money by nominal income as the target. 2 There were lasting legacies of this period. An important and useful element of the thinking at the time was the replacement of the earlier “control theory” approach to policy (i.e. the belief that the central point was to find an appropriate spot on the Phillips curve and to stay there)  towards a “game theoretic” view  in which the critical issues related to behaviour -- the interaction between the monetary authorities and the public. In Australia  the Reserve Bank never accepted the degree of policy instrument specialisation found in the academic literature  particularly as wages policy was also addressing inflation control. Partly because most inflation problems were demand-driven over the course of the cycle  there was a continuing belief that if the cycle could be smoothed  inflation would be contained  and both fiscal or monetary policy were available instruments in addressing the cycle. BIS Review 80/1997 - 3 - Curiously  however  the de facto inheritors of this stream of thought took price stability -- the long-term element of monetarism -- and made it a short-term target. In this view of the world  there was no role at all for monetary policy as a cyclical buffer. How was this justified? The arguments put forward were: • the classical dichotomy between prices and activity: money does not affect activity; • what might be called the “Tinbergen proposition”: with one instrument  only one goal can be achieved; • political economy reasons -- usually associated with “time inconsistency” arguments; • a simple  unambiguous commitment to price stability anchors price expectations most effectively  and this benefit is worth the cost that might come from ignoring activity; • the lags in recognition and implementation of policy are so long that activity stabilisation is futile or even counter-productive. I have looked at these in some detail in an earlier paper (Grenville 1996)  so I will be brief here. The classical dichotomy between prices and activity reminds central bankers of their long-term priorities  but even though the long-run Phillips curve may be vertical  the short-run curves are certainly not. The Tinbergen proposition is superficially attractive  but not much help in practical decision-making. Trade-offs between various objectives are common to policy-making (and just about every aspect of life)  and these trade-offs have to be handled by a weighing of the conflicting objectives  not by ignoring one of them. The “political economy” aspects have been prominent in the academic literature  and some very neat models can be built to illustrate the issues of time inconsistency. The models usually involve the “monetary authorities” (no distinction is made between governments and central banks) making an ex ante commitment to price stability  but reneging on this to squeeze higher activity in the short term  in the form of an “inflation surprise” (Kydland and Prescott 1977). The simple versions of the arguments have never appealed much to central bankers who believe that their own reputation is at stake and who  because of this  are unlikely to exploit the short-term Phillips curve trade-off. To see central bankers as congenitally inclined to administer “inflation surprises” does not seem to capture their true character.3 If there is a problem here  it seems more likely to lie in the political interaction of policy-making between governments and central banks and it is best addressed by greater independence  not by imposing a single objective on the central bank. What about the role of a simple single price objective in anchoring price expectations? A decade or so ago  there was a realistic hope that the clear enunciation of a target for prices would stabilise price expectations. It would have to be said that the experience of the last decade would suggest that expectations are to a very large degree backward-looking. Central banks give prominence to their price stability objective in an attempt to influence price 3 up the wrong tree”. Blinder (1997  p. 13) describes this as: “One place where academic economists have been barking loudly BIS Review 80/1997 - 4 - expectations in this way  and it seems sensible for them to do so. But it would be a mistake to think that there is a big dividend waiting to be reaped here. Whether the lags in recognition and implementation are so long as to make the operation of monetary policy perverse in relation to the business cycle is something that can be established only empirically. Like most empirical matters  there is room for considerable difference of opinion. While the lags seem to be (as Friedman promised) “long and variable”  a policy which leans against the business cycle with a view to containing demand-driven inflation will generally affect activity beneficially rather than perversely.4 At the other end of the spectrum is the view that “central bank manipulation of financial variables has seemingly exaggerated  not smoothed  economic fluctuations” (Makin 1993  p. 12). One problem in this sort of assessment is that we do not know the counter-factual. What we do know  however  is that cycles are endemic to all economies. So the counter-factual is not straight-line growth. We know  too  that Australia’s cycles are broadly the same as those in other similar countries. In a world where cycles are universal and endemic  it is easy to blame the authorities for the failure of the economy to proceed along a steady path  perfectly aligned with trend growth. As the upswing accelerates  policy is tightened: it is then blamed for being too slow to react. When the inevitable downturn comes  the firm policies that are in place at that time are pronounced “guilty by association”. The appropriate counter-factual should specify an alternative policy regime  and compare the performance under this rule.5 One relevant issue here is: how strong are the “self-righting” forces which tend to take unemployment back towards its natural rate? If these are strong  the case for an activity component in policy-making is weaker. To put this more specifically  will the in-built stabilising forces operate more quickly than the lags in monetary policy? The important empirical issue here is the lags in policy  interacting with the uncertainty of forecasts. Most estimates of the lags suggest that a change in interest rates has its maximum effect on activity after about four to six quarters. This is often popularly interpreted to mean that nothing happens  after the monetary policy lever is pulled  for four or six quarters. Of course  this is quite wrong. Even with these estimates  there is a fair bit of action during the first year  and provided forecasts are sufficiently accurate  it is possible for policy to be effective over shorter lengths of time -- for instance  if it was desired to have an effect for the next year only  policy could be reversed some time during the year to achieve rough neutrality beyond the period of a year (Gruen  Romalis and Chandra 1997).6 4 For some econometric support of this view  see Dungey and Pagan (1997  pp. 31-34). 5 Makin’s alternative is money-base targeting. The Bank has written extensively on money rules (the widest variety of tests appears in de Brouwer  Ng and Subbaraman (1993)). Makin’s model is Switzerland (the only major central bank that has tried to implement a money-base rule) in the 1980s  but this hardly seems a supporting example. Switzerland still has business cycles and experienced inflation of nearly 7 per cent in the late 1980s. 6 I should record  very much in parentheses  my own biases that these lags are consistently over-estimated  and that when we find more subtle techniques of econometric testing  we will find that the lags are shorter. This is based on pure  intuitive observation  particularly of the 1994 experience  where the effect of monetary policy seemed to be quite quick. This is a reminder that there are  essentially  two problems with the econometric method used to establish lag lengths. The first is the implicit assumption that the lags are much the same length from episode to episode (occasionally there are tests for changing lag length  as in Gruen et al. (1997))  whereas it may be that the lag depends very much on the particular episode. Where actors in the economy quickly come to believe that the authorities are determined to slow a speeding economy  it may well be that the lags are quite short. The contrast here is between 1988 (long lags) and 1994 (short). The other problem is the classic one of separately identifying the policy reaction function and the effect of policy on the economy. Relatively early in the upswing  policy is tightened  but there is no discernible response because the upswing still has a good deal of BIS Review 80/1997 - 5 - Perhaps a more telling argument is that it is simply not sensible -- or even possible -- to ignore the cycle  unless a suitable “neutral” operating rule can be found for setting monetary policy. The monetary aggregates were  in this sense  a “neutral” rule. They could provide an operating rule for monetary policy which could be relied on to influence activity beneficially in the face of demand shocks: a monetary rule exercises some degree of counter-cyclical influence  without any overt discretionary action. But with the breakdown of the close relationship between money and nominal income  such a monetary rule is not a satisfactory “automatic pilot” for policy  and no similarly neutral rule suggests itself. One possible “neutral” monetary policy would be to leave real interest rates unchanged  but it is hard to see that  in practice  this would be sustainable in the face of an economy either running abnormally quickly or slowly -- there would be continuing questions about whether the real interest rate that had been chosen was neutral or was  in fact  skewed in one direction or the other. Also  such a rule would not tie down the rate of inflation -- for this you need a nominal rather than a real objective. Another possibility that can be rejected fairly quickly is the rule of thumb apparently sometimes offered in the face of medical uncertainty: “First do no harm”. This may be sensible if medical malpractice suits threaten  but hardly seems a proper basis for economic policy  as it seems to be unduly biased towards inaction. Equally easy to dismiss are those who suggest that we should do something to control inflation  but say that the lags between policy and activity are so long and uncertain that we should never try to do anything to influence activity. The problem with this suggestion is that if the lags between policy and activity are long  uncertain and variable  then the lags between policy and inflation are longer and more uncertain still. In a world where demand shocks are common and policy operates on inflation largely via activity  it is hard to conceive of an anti-inflation policy which was somehow directed solely at inflation  in the belief that an attempt to direct it at activity will cause more problems than it solves.7 Given the long lags in policy  there would seem to be a prima facie case for the authorities moving not just pre-emptively  but by large amounts whenever they believe that the cycle is turning. Such a policy has been advocated by Goodhart (1992).8 Curiously  in the light of these arguments  policy in Australia and just about everywhere seems to do precisely the opposite -- it has the characteristic of “interest rate smoothing”. Others in the Bank have written about this recently (see Lowe and Ellis (1997))  so I can cover this quite briefly. In short  the reasons seem to be: • uncertainty. Thirty years ago  Brainard established that  if policy-makers are uncertain about the effect of their policies  they should do less than they think would otherwise be optimal; • if policy-makers erred by applying too much of the instrument against the cycle  they would surely be severely blamed for it; on the other hand  momentum. In this phase  the econometrics are trying to separate two effects with different signs  and to the extent that these two effects are confounded (because  for example  the equation may not embody a perfect explanation for the non-policy forces operating on activity)  this negates or reduces the apparent power of monetary policy in this early phase of the cycle. In this view of the world  the econometrically-estimated lag lengths are as much a reflection of the periodicity of the cycle as they are of the lags of monetary policy. 7 8 sharply  both up and down.” (Goodhart 1992  p. 333). For those who prefer a more formal explanation of the same point  see de Brouwer and O’Regan (1997). “Central bankers need to brave their innate caution and be prepared to vary nominal interest rates BIS Review 80/1997 - 6 - dampening the cycle without entirely eliminating it is seen as an acceptable outcome. In this world  policy-makers are more likely to lean on the side of caution in exercising their instrument. In short  the arguments about the difficulties of influencing activity should make central bankers cautious and modest about their role as cyclical stabilisers  but do not excuse them from taking the cycle into account in setting policy  and doing what they can to lop peaks and fill troughs. With inflation down  a consensus among central banks seems to be emerging. Central banks still give very high priority to inflation control (they are  after all  the embodiment of Rogoff’s anti-inflationary central banker)  but they do not  generally  focus exclusively on price stability. The arguments are essentially empirical ones  with the focus on the question: “how fast can the economy grow while maintaining price stability?” You will note the Reserve Bank’s rhetoric is precisely along these lines  with policy driven by common-sense and a strenuous effort to understand the cycle  rather than some doctrinal adherence to a simple rule. Has the cycle changed (and if so  how)? There is much talk  particularly in America  of a New Era in economics -- of rapid growth  no cycles and price stability. While something important and beneficial does seem to be happening in the United States  we need to separate out what is possible from the wishful thinking. We all hope that productivity is higher than before: this is possible and might add modestly to US long-term growth potential  which has in the past been put at around 2-2½ per cent. We hope that  with price stability well established and various other changes in the economy (on which  more later)  the amplitude of cycles might be lessened and policy may be more effective. We hope  also  that prices are well anchored by America’s good record of low inflation. But the fundamental law of economics -- scarcity -- has not been repealed. The factors that are held to be responsible for the New Era -- “globalisation of production  changes in finance  the nature of employment  government policy  emerging markets  and information technology” (Weber 1997  p. 71) -- will all be helpful  but they raise the long-term sustainable growth rate only to the extent to which they raise productivity growth on an on-going basis. If the actual rate of growth exceeds the long-term potential  sooner or later pressure comes on resources and inflation will be the result. The same helpful factors may well apply in Australia: • if some kind of multiplier/accelerator process is the driving force of the cycle  we know that the type of investment has changed substantially over the years  with large fixed long-term investment becoming less important and short-term investments (such as computers) becoming more important. The old traditional driving force was the inventory cycle. Work done at the Bank (Flood and Lowe 1993) shows a clear change in the cyclical pattern. The average quarterly contribution of inventory investment to GDP(E) has fallen from close to 1 per cent in 1960/61-1971/72 to around a quarter of that in 1984/85-1995/96 (with smaller standard deviations as well). This confirms our intuitive observation of the prevalence of “just in time” inventory systems.9 What is clear  too  is that service industries (with much more limited stock-holding) have become very much more important; 9 Of course  the story has to be more complicated than this  because “just in time” simply pushes the problem back to a different stage of production  and raises the question that if inventories are not acting as a buffer for production  then perhaps the processes of production become more cyclical. BIS Review 80/1997 - 7 - • as cyclical components of production become less dominant  the cycle may be attenuated. Manufacturing  construction and wholesale trade have been the production sectors most correlated with the overall cycle and these  together  have fallen from nearly 40 per cent of production in 1974/75 to just over 30 per cent in 1995/96. As the economy becomes more complex and varied  correlation between sectors diminishes: the tourism sector may be doing well when house construction is slow; • perhaps the most important on-going change to the cycle is the continuing integration of Australia with the international economy. Thirty years ago  10 per cent of (real) GDP was exported; now it is almost 25 per cent. When domestic demand rises  there is much greater capacity than before for this to “spill” overseas  into imports. All this is for others to examine in more detail. The focus here is on just one aspect of the way the cycle might have changed over time -- that is  how the interaction between monetary policy and the cycle may have altered. First  has financial deregulation changed the interaction between monetary policy and the cycle? This was certainly expected to be one of the impacts of financial deregulation. The Campbell Inquiry talked about it.10 In the housing sector  for example  the upswing of the cycle suddenly came up against the restraints of quantitative controls  and this was enough to turn the cycle down. In the old  regulated world  firms and households were not able to borrow enough to smooth their expenditure over time (they were “liquidity constrained” -- see Blundell-Wignall and Bullock (1992)). It may well be that deregulation has removed these old constraints  but at the same time  it seems to have had some tendency to encourage or at least facilitate large or longer swings of the cycle. To put it crudely  financial deregulation provided more rope for the cycle to swing with greater amplitude. It would be easy to exaggerate the importance of this effect  because there were very large swings in the housing sector before deregulation  and asset-price booms and busts occurred even in the regulated world. We might hope  too  that some lessons have been learned from the asset boom of the late 1980s. The conclusion that can be drawn is that those who expected financial deregulation to smooth the cycle by itself have been disappointed. One specific aspect of deregulation -- the floating of the exchange rate -- has altered the transmission of monetary policy in a way which should have smoothed the cycle. One of the characteristics of the floating exchange rate is that its movement more or less mirrors the course of the cycle  with an appreciation of the exchange rate at those moments when the cycle is running fastest. Partly this reflects the impact of commodity prices on the exchange rate  but it also reflects the policy response of interest rates over the course of the cycle. The result is that demand is more readily “spilt” into imports during the expansionary phase of the cycle  so production is buffered. (This reinforces the effect of greater international integration  mentioned 10 “The Committee concludes that  in the long run  housing financiers’ inflows would be more stable if their interest rates were allowed to move in line with market forces. Coupled with greater overall monetary stability  interest rate decontrol may help appreciably to stabilise housing finance flows  especially as household sector investors have become more interest-rate sensitive. The reduced volatility in funds flows should contribute to a more stable housing sector over the long term. This might result in a slower growth in housing costs.” (Australian Financial System Inquiry 1981  p. 639). BIS Review 80/1997 - 8 - above.)11 Even this  however  does not ensure that the new world of the floating exchange rate makes the cycle smoother: it can be argued that in the old fixed-exchange-rate world  policy reacted earlier to stop the expansionary phase of the cycle  for fear of it spilling over into an unacceptable current account deficit. So  once again  financial deregulation has given the cycle  for better or worse  more room for manoeuvre. The old world of “stop/start” did not have much to recommend it  but nor did the world of the late 1980s  where an asset boom developed a big head of steam and inevitably was damaging when it came to an end. The floating exchange rate probably allows expansions to last longer  but does not ensure that they end gently. Graph 1: Graph 2: This history makes us look for a degree of caution in policy-making  aiming for longer  gentler phases in the cycle. There is nothing in the historical patterns of the cycle which suggests that they have a pendulum-like determinancy. On the contrary  the variation in length and amplitude (contrast  for example  1986 with 1982 or 1990: see also Graph 2) would suggest that the shape of the cycle is not at all regular and pre-determined. While it may be possible to explain cycles in terms of “a stochastically disturbed difference equation of very low order” (Lucas 1977)  the true causes seem less mechanical than this might imply  particularly if the implication is that cycles are unaffected by and unresponsive to policy. 11 Graph 1 shows the combined effect. This effect was noted  in the early 1960s  by Burge Cameron. Has greater integration and a flexible exchange rate made this effect stronger over time? There was a fair bit of exchange rate flexibility in the 1970s  so the proper comparison may need to go back earlier. BIS Review 80/1997 - 9 - The hope is that the upswing which has been underway since 1991 can go for quite some time yet. This may well require it to travel at a sedate pace at certain stages during the expansion  and we have certainly witnessed this over the past two years or so. But this seems far preferable to an economy which is running clearly too fast and has to be brought to a sudden halt. While it is true that the economy might well have grown a bit faster over the past two years without this igniting inflationary pressures  the one factor that most economists agree on is that monetary policy cannot fine-tune the cycle. Let me develop this idea by looking in detail at the 1994 experience. The starting point here was an economy which began to grow too fast  with demand growing at 7 per cent in the year to the September quarter  and excessive wage demands. The Bank judged that this would produce inflationary pressures  and so raised interest rates three times in relatively quick succession in the second half of 1994. As far as we can tell  this was a necessary adjustment of policy  because the classic symptoms of excess demand emerged over the 1994/95 period with wages accelerating (to reach over 5 per cent by the middle of 1995  despite high unemployment  at around 9 per cent) and then  lagged behind this  inflation rising to 3.3 per cent. Given the fragile nature of price expectations and the importance of getting actual inflation back towards 2½ per cent relatively quickly to reinforce the stability of price expectations  the response of policy  even with the benefit of hindsight  seems about right. (Graph 3) Graph 3: To round off this section  ensuring that you are not left with a false impression about the Bank’s (limited) ability to tame the cycle  I present Graph 4. This might suggest that the Australian cycle (at least from the early 1980s until the mid 1990s) has followed the American cycle so closely that any other explanation seems superfluous. To put this point differently  the problem in explaining the cycle is not to find the causes of cyclical behaviour  but to decide -- in the face of a wide variety of “culprits” -- which one is  in fact  driving the cycle. In some ways this is like an Agatha Christie detective story  with all the characters equally and obviously suspect. Unlike an Agatha Christie novel  however  it is possible that they all did it  if not simultaneously and in concert  at least more or less coincidentally. The Bank’s BIS Review 80/1997 - 10 - econometric research certainly gives a very important place to the United States in explaining the Australian cycle (see Gruen and Shuetrim (1994)) and we have looked at the puzzle of why the United States seems so much more important than its trade share would imply (see de Roos and Russell (1996)  de Brouwer and Romalis (1996) and Debelle and Preston (1995)). But there is still an important role for monetary policy (Gruen and Shuetrim 1994  and Gruen  Romalis and Chandra 1997). The moral is: don’t expect monetary policy to be able to eliminate the cycle  but don’t ignore its ability to “top and tail” the fluctuations. Graph 4: The cycle and prices The Reserve Bank does expect that its activities will have some beneficial effect on the course of the cycle  but the main focus is on inflation. We accept that there will be some movement of inflation over the course of the cycle  but we want to make sure that inflation does not rise over time (now that price stability has been achieved). You can see this sense of priorities -- with medium-term price stability being the sine qua non  and our acceptance that inflation may vary a little over the course of the cycle -- in the specification of the inflation target as being an average “over the course of the cycle”. This has caused quite a bit of misinterpretation about the specification. In talking to an audience such as this  I can take the time to set out quite specifically what we have in mind by “over the course of the cycle”. We can go back a bit in history to illustrate the point here. In the 1950s and 1960s (see Graph 5)  inflation moved about quite a bit -- from more or less zero to around 5 per cent per annum -- but people look back on this period as “price stability”. Why is that so? The critical issue here is that even though inflation rose and fell over the course of the cycle  price expectations did not move -- even when inflation was running at 5 per cent  the community at large expected it would soon be back to its normal lower pace. Stabilising and maintaining price expectations is the key issue in thinking about the question of “over the course of the cycle”. The BIS Review 80/1997 - 11 - Graph 5: Bank should not be so trigger happy that it tightens policy at every threat of a price rise (no matter how slight or temporary).There is a trade-off between output stabilisation and price stabilisation (see Debelle and Stevens (1995))  and an attempt to smooth the path of prices perfectly would make policy destabilising. We want to be on -- and stay on -- the short-term Phillips curve associated with 2-3 per cent price expectations. We would not be too fretted if actual inflation moves about a bit over the short term  provided price expectations do not change (i.e. we stay on this short-run curve). To put this in operational terms  if we have limited price stability credibility  we have to be more careful that inflation does not depart much from 2½ per cent  or depart for too long. As credibility builds over time  monetary policy does not have to respond to every hint of inflation  knowing that the small fluctuations in inflation over the course of the cycle will not have any permanent effects. We would then  in effect  be back to the world of the 1950s and 1960s  at least as far as price expectations are concerned. In raising this issue of price movements over the course of the cycle  I should also record that the relationship between activity and prices probably has changed quite a bit over recent years. I have written about this in more detail (Grenville 1997 )  so I will not go into it in detail today. But summarising the argument  there are a number of factors which should make prices less sensitive to the course of the cycle: • the float of the exchange rate; • greater international integration; • greater competition  coming both from international integration and from domestic measures to enhance competition; • better linkages between markets  largely via better transport and communication. All this fits with the earlier discussion of “New Era economics”. These factors help to prevent inflation being triggered by the expansionary phase of the cycle  and limit the propagation of inflation shocks. While we often think of price stability as being a medium-term and long-term problem  the obvious point is that the medium term is made up of a series of short terms -- if short-term hikes in inflation can be avoided  then the problem of maintaining price BIS Review 80/1997 - 12 - stability in the medium and long term has been solved. But Chairman Greenspan’s warning  in February 1997  about too-ready acceptance of a “New Era” is still relevant: “But  regrettably  history is strewn with visions of such ‘new eras’ that  in the end  have proven to be a mirage. In short  history counsels caution.” (Greenspan 1997). Price stability still requires good monetary policy supported by an anti-inflation consensus. Conclusion Economics has long been known as the dismal science  but in recent years mortality has become a pre-occupation. Judging by recent book titles  not only is the business cycle dead  but so too are inflation  economics  history and capitalism. Following Greenspan’s lead  it would be wise to withhold judgment on the death of the cycle for the moment  or at least borrow Mark Twain’s line and say that the reports are greatly exaggerated. Economies still seem vulnerable to alternating “over optimism … (and) a contrary error of pessimism” as noted by Keynes. Periodic supply-side shocks still seem likely. And policy-makers have not suddenly become omniscient masters of the previously-recalcitrant economy. But two factors should help. The first is the greater price resilience  noted in the previous section. Inflation is not dead  but enhanced competition in goods and factor markets inhibits the propagation of price shocks across the economy. Second  low inflation has now become the international norm. The variance over the course of the cycle has also fallen. In Australia  inflation has averaged 2½ per cent annually for the past six years. The last two sharp downturns (1982 and 1990) followed sharp rises in inflation (including asset inflation) in the previous upswing. If excessive optimism in the upswing can be resisted and inflation can be kept in check  there is a good chance that such sharp downturns can be avoided. Good  forward-looking and far-sighted policy can reduce the amplitude of cycles and lengthen them. The seven-year upswing which started in 1982 (with a “pause that refreshes” in 1986) should not be regarded as the norm: it can be exceeded. The current upswing has  already  lasted almost as long and seems to have a fair bit of life left in it yet. The price that may have to be paid for these long-lasting upswings is to avoid periods of excessive exuberance -- this is what brought the 1980s upswing to a halt. This was the motivation for the 1994 policy response -- to avoid the stop/go policies of earlier years. We should  instead  be prepared to allow growth to build momentum over time  without becoming too impatient. This will produce a world of longer expansions  which will not require the extremes of policy-setting which were needed in the late 1980s (or  for that matter  the early 1980s) to bring that expansion (with its asset-price bubble) back under control.

The BIS Annual Report for 1996-97 observes  with characteristic understatement: “The last 25 years have been an eventful time for central banking”. The period since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system has  indeed  seen enormous changes in the economic and financial environment  and a major evolution in the objectives  indicators and instruments of central bank policy. My objective this afternoon will be to review these changes  and to identify some of the common factors that lie behind them. The changes in the environment have been of both a macro-economic and a structural character. Macro-economically  the move to floating exchange rates in the early 1970s was followed by a period of substandard economic performance. In the industrial world high inflation rates co-existed with disappointing growth. In the developing world  a borrowing spree was followed by a debt crisis. Not until the last few years have monetary authorities been successful in restoring a more satisfactory degree of price stability  and still the task is not complete. There have also been dramatic changes in financial structure. The process of liberalisation and innovation has led to a globalisation of finance and a quantum increase in intermediation. Coupled with an explosive growth in ever more complex financial instruments  this has presented new opportunities to financial intermediaries  but also created new sources of systemic risk. The changing environment has both influenced and been influenced by an evolution in the way central banks carry out their role of preserving monetary and financial stability. In the field of monetary stability  attempts to exploit the Phillips curve trade-off produced almost wholly negative results and led to a widespread consensus that the primary objective of monetary policy must be price stability. The intermediate targets of monetary policy objectives have also evolved  with the earlier emphasis on monetary aggregates giving way to exchange rate anchors in some countries and explicit or implicit inflation targets in others. At the level of tactics  market management techniques  which were formerly quite diverse  have tended to coalesce around the use of repurchase operations as a means of controlling very short-term interest rates. The other main function of central banks  that of preserving financial system stability  has acquired considerably more prominence as a result of financial liberalisation  which has led to the greatest spate of banking sector difficulties since the interwar period. The focus of central banks’ approach to maintaining systemic stability has evolved from field-of-activity regulation to a greater stress on capital adequacy  and is still in the process of change. Meanwhile  a number of countries are rethinking the institutional structure of supervision  with some placing responsibility for day-to-day regulation with specialised supervisory agencies and assigning to the central bank the broad  though less well-defined responsibility for systemic stability. Throughout these changes  a constant feature has been central banks’ search for effective means of implementing policy in an environment where economic agents can use new instruments and markets to arbitrage their way around restrictions and controls. The desire to avoid distorting incentives and exacerbating moral hazard has been a guiding principle in this search. The authorities have sought anchors for policy that are compatible with profit-seeking behaviour by private agents in an increasingly competitive market. It is this search that will be the underlying theme of this lecture. I will begin by noting some of the driving forces behind the changes that have taken place in the financial industry  and how they have manifested themselves. The key consequence for policy  I will argue  is that markets have become more complete  thus increasing the scope for BIS Review 81/1997 - 2 - arbitrage by private agents  and decreasing the scope for the monetary authorities to use direct controls to achieve policy objectives. In the next part of my remarks  I will review how approaches to monetary policy have evolved over the past 25 years  in respect of ultimate goals  intermediate targets and policy instruments. After this  I will consider how financial stability has grown as a policy concern  and how the way in which supervision is viewed has evolved. Finally  I will have a few words to say about the international monetary system. I. The Changing Financial Environment The driving forces behind the transformation in the financial environment that has occurred in the past twenty to thirty years have been innovation and liberalisation. Technological advances have dramatically lowered the cost of gathering and processing information  while new financial instruments have increased the range of transactions economic agents can undertake. Liberalisation has paved the way for the expansion and restructuring of the financial industry. It has been driven both by the ascendancy of the free market philosophy and by the difficulty of maintaining controls in the face of innovation. The combined effects of innovation and liberalisation have been dramatic. Geographical barriers have largely disappeared  leading to the emergence of an increasingly integrated global capital market with a sizable group of multinational financial intermediaries operating in all the major centres. Distinctions among different classes of financial intermediary have become blurred  with the relaxation of regulatory restraints  the growth of conglomerate structures  and the increasing ease with which institutions can transform the risk characteristics of their portfolios through the use of derivatives. Another significant development has been the securitisation of assets and the institutionalisation of savings. Together  these trends have greatly increased the volume of tradable financial assets  and the amount of transactions passing through financial markets and settled in clearing systems. The significance for central banks of these developments in the financial environment is that they have made markets more complete  that is  they have greatly increased the ability of market participants to exchange assets and income flows over time  space  and market instrument. Portfolio management is far less constrained than before by lack of access to liabilities or claims with desired pay-off characteristics. This has profound effects for central bank activity  both in the formulation and implementation of monetary policy  and in the preservation of financial stability. At the macro-economic level  markets can now discipline policies far more quickly and effectively than in the past. Bad policies  or indeed any policies that are unsustainable in the face of profit-maximising behaviour by private agents  will quickly have to be reversed. This means that the authorities always have to consider  in framing economic policies  whether they are credible and how the market will react to them. It is very hard  for example  to spring an inflationary “surprise” that has a positive effect on output; or to set an exchange rate objective that is inconsistent with the underlying stance of macro-economic policies. Concerning financial stability  more complete markets mean that competition squeezes out rents created by restricted franchises. Financial institutions have less of a cushion of protected profits and are therefore more vulnerable to losses caused by mismanagement or misfortune. This has inevitably increased the emphasis given to the role of the authorities as the ultimate guarantor of financial stability. At the same time  it has reduced the effectiveness of regulation that is not based on market incentives. Financial institutions have a broad menu of techniques that enable them to get around regulations that are intended to increase safety  but are burdensome to the institutions to which they apply. BIS Review 81/1997 - 3 - II. Monetary Policy (a) Objectives In the aftermath of the collapse of the Bretton Woods system (and for the United States for some time before that)  monetary policy was designed to secure the best trade-off between output growth and inflation. The intellectual basis of policy was the Phillips curve. Eventually  however  the stagflation that marked the 1970s caused both the objective of policy and its implementation to be reassessed. Today  there is a widespread consensus among central bankers  and economists more generally  that price stability should be the overriding goal of monetary policy. The rational expectations literature  and the lessons of experience  suggest that there is no exploitable trade-off between output and inflation in anything other than the very short run. Moreover  inflation leads to distortions and uncertainties that impair economic performance. Worse  the short-run relationship between inflation and output growth seems to be asymmetric: the output sacrifice needed to get inflation down may be greater than the output gain when inflation is allowed to rise. Taken together  these considerations mean that the best service monetary policy can render for the real economy is to keep inflation credibly at low levels. In fact  policy has been remarkably successful in recent years in bringing inflation down in virtually all industrial countries. So much so  that a number of issues are now coming to the fore that were previously considered as of second-order importance. These questions include: how to avoid bias in the measurement of inflation; whether inflation should be zero or some low positive number; whether the authorities’ objective should be expressed in terms of inflation or the price level; and how quickly one should return to the stated objective after a disturbance. It is hard to dispute that measurement bias in inflation should be corrected  if possible. That is easier said than done  however. Some biases can be relatively easily removed  such as that arising from infrequent re-weighting of the consumption basket. Others are more difficult to deal with  such as adjusting adequately for quality changes. And some are very difficult to correct  such as properly incorporating new goods and services. Still  with some heroic assumptions it should be possible to arrive at a serviceable estimate. The Boskin Commission in the United States has put the bias at just over 1%; in other countries  the bias is thought to be no more than half that. Concerning the desirable level of (properly measured) inflation  there seems to be a consensus that a low positive number (1-3%) is better than zero.1 The reasons for this are both a priori and empirical. When inflation averages zero over time  the price level must  by definition  be falling for a significant part of the time (and a significant number of individual prices will be falling  even if the general price level is flat). This creates two problems. Firstly  if wages and prices are sticky downward  it may require a higher level of unemployment to stabilise the overall inflation rate at zero than at some higher number.2 Secondly  since nominal interest rates cannot go below zero  it will become impossible to engineer negative (or even very low) real interest rates to help recovery from a recession. Such considerations have led most observers to favour a low but positive rate of inflation. Those who prefer zero tend to point to the distortionary effects of the tax system 3 or to the risk that any positive number can be revised up  as justifying the more ambitious target. 1 Symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  Jackson Hole  Wyoming.

Romer and D. BIS Review 81/1997 - 4 - It is the fear of slippage that also motivates the suggestion to express the price stability objective as a constant price level (rather than a zero or constant rate of inflation). The idea is that the impact of an inflationary (or deflationary) surprise in one period should be offset in the succeeding period by a policy aiming at reversing the initial shock. In this way  the price level would be constant through time  enhancing the credibility of monetary policy and facilitating the development of very long-term contracts. One obvious objection to the pursuit of a policy of literal price level stability  namely that it would require deliberate deflation following any inflationary disturbance  can be overcome by expressing the price objective in terms of a rising trend through time. Nevertheless  perhaps surprisingly  there is still little support in central banking circles for expressing the inflation objective in terms of the price level  rather than its first derivative. This may be because  if there is believed to be an optimal inflation objective  whether zero or a low positive number  it seems odd to adjust it as a result of past events. The last element of objective setting for central banks is how quickly they should seek to return to an inflation target once having been forced away from it. There seems to be an emerging consensus  reflected  inter alia  in statements by the Bank of England  that a period of 1-2 years is appropriate  this being the time it takes for a change in monetary policy to have the bulk of its effect in prices. To attempt a quicker restoration of price stability would risk overshooting  while to go more slowly would tend to undermine credibility. It should be noted  however  that this recommendation holds clearly only for minor departures from the objective. If the actual inflation rate is a long way away from the desired rate  there is no consensus on whether gradual or shock therapy is to be preferred. Much depends on the political circumstances  as well as on surrounding economic policies (e.g. fiscal policy) that affect credibility. (b) Anchors Just as difficult as setting the objective of monetary policy has been settling on the means for achieving it. A variety of approaches have been in vogue at various times in the past twenty or thirty years. Pure discretion has acquired a bad name because  at least in countries with non- independent central banks  it is seen as a cloak for politically-motivated decisions. Such decisions have sometimes been a crude attempt to buy votes by easing of monetary policy before elections  the benefits of monetary relaxation coming relatively quickly and the costs of higher inflation emerging only later. More frequently  however  they have involved an attempt to use a presumed output/inflation trade-off to strengthen employment prospects; or an unwillingness to tighten monetary policy until evidence of inflationary pressures was already apparent in the data. Whatever the motivation  a fully discretionary policy has often lacked the strategic coherence to prevent inflation accelerating. Monetary targeting became popular in a number of countries in the 1970s  on the back of Milton Friedman’s dictum that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon”.4 The powerful intuitive appeal of the money-inflation link was undoubtedly helpful in mobilising support for a rigorous anti-inflation policy in the United States  United Kingdom and elsewhere in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Nevertheless  one of the key requirements for such a policy  namely a stable demand for some monetary aggregate  has not been adequately fulfilled in recent years (at least in most countries). One by one  central banks that had adopted monetary targets 4 Controls  and the Market Place: Policy Choices in a Full Employment Economy""  Chicago and London. Friedman  Milton: ""What Price Guideposts?""  in George P. Schultz and R.Z. Aliber (eds.): ""Guidelines  Informal BIS Review 81/1997 - 5 - in the 1970s  dropped or downgraded them in the 1980s and 1990s. Nowadays only Germany and Switzerland place strong reliance on monetary aggregate targeting  and even they apply such policies with a significant measure of judgment. Exchange rate targeting has a long history. The gold standard involved stabilising the domestic price level in terms of gold  and the Bretton Woods system linked national currencies to the dollar. More recently  exchange rate anchors have been used effectively by a wide range of countries. Their value in restoring discipline and credibility is hard to doubt. But they have two major disadvantages that have become evident in recent years. Firstly  when capital markets are integrated  any country adopting a strict exchange rate peg subordinates its monetary policy to that of the anchor country. This works well when monetary policy requirements are in harmony; less well when there are divergences  as the United Kingdom discovered in 1992. Secondly  if a country adopting a currency peg fails to master domestic inflationary pressures  it may find that its balance of trade deteriorates and eventually reaches a point of unsustainability. The decision to adjust or abandon an unrealistic peg has proved to be one of the most difficult of economic policy decisions – in part because so much has typically gone into seeking to achieve credibility through adherence to the peg. In response to the perceived shortcomings of monetary and exchange rate targets  and of unconstrained discretion  attention has been given in recent years to inflation targeting and central bank autonomy as a means of strengthening the likelihood that price stability objectives will be met. At first sight it might seem tautological to use an inflation target to achieve an inflation objective. In fact  there is rather more to it  as the practice in the United Kingdom shows. The idea is that a public commitment to an inflation target  coupled with the maximum of transparency in describing the authorities’ forecasts and decision-making process  enables a discretionary approach to be applied with less risk that monetary policy decisions will be biased toward leniency. If  in addition  the central bank is made fully independent to pursue a clearly-defined goal  political interference will be avoided. A growing list of countries have adopted the inflation targeting approach in recent years  including Canada  New Zealand  Australia  the United Kingdom  Sweden and Finland. The practical implementation of the approach has varied in a number of respects  including who sets the target (government or central bank); whether it is expressed as a range or a fixed point; the price index employed; the use of adjustment or “override” mechanisms  and so on. These differences  however  are less significant than the common principle on which targets are based. So far  targets have been rather successful  though the approach has yet to be tested under adverse conditions. (c) Tactics Just as there has been convergence in the goals and the strategy of monetary policy implementation  so too there has been in matters of tactics. Twenty or thirty years ago  a variety of operating tactics were used  including control of some measure of the monetary base; variations in reserve requirements; discretionary discount window intervention; open market operations  at a variety of maturities; direct lending controls; and moral suasion. Nowadays  direct controls on lending have been abandoned in virtually all countries. Reserve requirements have been reduced to very low levels  to avoid distorting patterns of intermediation  thus making control of the monetary base an imprecise instrument. Use of the discount window and bond market intervention have similarly fallen out of favour. Central banks now generally use very short-term reversible transactions (“repos” and “reverse repos”) to inject or withdraw cash from the money market. The maturity of these transactions is typically either overnight or for a few days. BIS Review 81/1997 - 6 - Short-term money market operations enable central banks to maintain control over overnight interest rates. Longer-term interest rates are then influenced by expectations of how central banks are likely to adjust overnight rates in the face of economic developments. This  in turn  places a premium on credibility and effective signalling of policy intentions. The use of interest rates as the principal operating instrument does not mean  it should be stressed  that the volume of money and credit is considered unimportant as a determinant of inflationary trends. Rather  it reflects the view that “noise” in the demand for bank reserves is better accommodated by some short-term flexibility in the growth of liquidity than by fluctuations in overnight interest rates; and by the belief that judicious management of overnight interest rates will enable the authorities to achieve the desired degree of control over credit volumes in the medium term. At the same time  it is also part and parcel of the process that has led central banks to place relatively more weight on prices (interest rates  exchange rates) than on quantities in the formulation and implementation of policy. There are several reasons for this  ranging from the socio-political climate to structural economic factors such as the development of financial markets. II. Financial System Stability Besides the achievement of price stability through the appropriate use of monetary policy  the other major focus of central bank activity is the preservation of stability in the financial system. As first articulated by Bagehot  this involves a willingness to act as a lender-of-last-resort to the banking system  to counteract the possibility of a “run” developing on a solvent but illiquid institution  and to avoid the risk of a contagious spread of financial distress. Central banks have always had an important role in maintaining systemic stability  but it is only comparatively recently that economists generally have become aware of the analytic issues involved. Following the crisis of the 1930s  there was growing agreement  first in the United States and later elsewhere  that the stability of the financial system should be based on two pillars: firstly  explicit or implicit support to protect depositors at banking institutions; and secondly  a structure of regulation that would reduce the risk of banks getting into trouble in the first place. For the first twenty-five years or so of the post-war period  banking system stability attracted relatively little attention. Economic conditions were favourable  which limited the scope for troublesome bad-lending decisions. Just as important  restrictions on market access and regulation of permitted activities enhanced franchise values and provided protection against losses. Essentially  entry into banking was restricted  both by natural economies of scale and by regulatory restraints. Competition within the banking industry was limited by tolerating cartel-type practices and by rules  such as interest rate and credit expansion ceilings  that protected existing firms. Such practices greatly reduced the probability of bank failure. The value of the banking franchise made stockholders and managements unwilling to take risks with the continued viability of firms under their control. And if serious losses did occur  rescue by other firms was likely  either in order to acquire a valuable franchise  or as part of an implicit quid pro quo for the maintenance of their own favoured status. Two forces came to the fore in the 1970s and subsequently that made this regulatory approach unsustainable. One was the growing influence of the free market philosophy  and the accompanying dismantling of controls and restrictive practices. This affected the willingness of public authorities to limit competition in the name of stability. The other was the development of new financial instruments that enabled market participants to replicate virtually any kind of contract  regardless of regulatory restraints. This affected the ability of policy makers to influence financial activity through regulatory controls. Interest ceilings on demand deposits were circumvented by the development of NOW accounts; exchange controls spawned the development of Euro-currency BIS Review 81/1997 - 7 - accounts; and the growth of derivatives markets provided transactors with a multiplicity of ways of creating contracts with equivalent pay-off characteristics but different forms. The breakdown and eventual abandonment of direct controls required renewed attention to the issue of how to make the financial system resilient. The search was made more urgent by the fact that banks’ capital strength had (predictably enough) weakened during the period when their protected franchise generated guaranteed profits. This weaker capital position was highlighted by a number of episodes in the 1970s and early 1980s  notably the Third World debt crisis that erupted in 1982. The vulnerability of banking systems in industrial countries that was revealed by the 1980s debt crisis led to a renewed focus on risk-based capital adequacy as a means of strengthening systemic resilience. Bank regulators had  of course  always had rules for capital holding by the institutions they supervised  but these were not harmonised across countries  and in many jurisdictions  they were in the form of crude capital/asset ratios. What was different about the regulatory approach developed in the 1980s is that it was founded on international agreement  and it focused on the concept of capital as a cushion against risk. The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision had been created in 1974  with the initial task of identifying which country’s supervisors should be responsible for the activities and soundness of internationally active banks. In the mid-1980s the Committee turned its attention to the development of capital standards for such banks. When finally promulgated in 1988  these standards divided banks’ assets into five risk categories  running from sovereign securities of industrial countries (with a zero risk weight) to ordinary commercial credits (with a 100% risk weight). Supervisors from G-10 countries agreed to see that internationally-active banks under their jurisdiction held capital at least equivalent to 8% of risk weighted assets. The Basle Capital Accord  which has subsequently been updated and amended  was a substantial step forward for bank regulation. It meant that required levels of capital were more closely related to the reasons for which banks hold capital  that is  to cover the risks in their portfolio. At a practical level  it led to a marked strengthening of major banks’ capital ratios  which had become dangerously low. But although the Basle Capital Accord took regulatory practice a significant way towards the market  it did not take it the whole way. The limited number of risk categories obviously (and deliberately) did not capture the full spectrum of creditworthiness. And the “building block” approach to the calculation of risk did not allow for the risk-reducing (risk-enhancing) properties of diversification (concentration). Much recent thinking has focused on incentive-compatible regulation – using the market’s own internal forces – as the most promising next step strengthening the financial system. It is banks’ shareholders and management that have the strongest interest to measure risk accurately (at least if they expect to be around to bear the consequences of their actions). An internally generated measure of risk should be better than one derived from formulaic risk-weights generated by supervisors. There is  therefore  a strong case for supervisors to use the calculations developed by firms themselves  at least if they can be satisfied that the risk assessment model is adequately robust. This is the approach that the Basle Committee in fact followed when the capital accord was amended to include market risk in addition to credit risk. The difficulties of extending the approach to credit risk are considerable  since a loan portfolio does not have a market value whose variability can be tracked over a series of observations. Nevertheless  the concept is similar  and the best financial firms are now beginning to apply a similar methodology to the calculation of credit risk as they do to market risk. BIS Review 81/1997 - 8 - Does this mean that decisions relating to prudential capital requirements can be left to private institutions? Not quite. Although private institutions are  in principle  best placed to measure the riskiness of their own portfolio  they are not necessarily the best judge of how much capital they ought to hold. This is because when a public authority acts as a lender-of-last-resort  or ultimate guarantor of systemic stability  that authority is providing part of the “capital” that the banking system needs to safeguard stability. In the absence of regulatory rules  financial institutions would be tempted to economise on capital holding  reasoning that the authorities would either come to their assistance  or shoulder the consequences of systemic failure. So even if the task of measuring risk can be largely privatised  the task of deciding the appropriate level of capital holding may still require a public policy judgment. Important public policy decisions are also involved in dealing with financial institutions which  for whatever reason  find themselves with an inadequate capital. Low levels of capital can lead to the phenomenon of “gambling for resurrection” – banks pursuing risky strategies in the knowledge that shareholders will get the benefit of good outcomes  while bad outcomes will impose losses on third parties. Thus far  I have discussed financial stability in terms of the health of the institutions that go to make up the banking system. But there is another dimension that has received increasing attention from central bankers over the past 10-15 years. It concerns the market infrastructure that underpins financial transactions  and in particular the payment and settlement system. While this might seem an unexciting subject to economists  it is in fact of great practical importance. At a conservative estimate  more that $5 trillion per day passes through the settlement system  most of it representing large-value financial transactions cleared by a relative handful of major clearing banks. If one of these institutions became unable to meet its obligations in the clearing  the consequences could be dramatic. Because this is the case  it is worth taking a moment to understand the issues that arise. Broadly speaking  there are two sets of problems. Easiest to understand are the problems facing users of payment and settlement systems – that is  those who trade in financial markets and then have to use the systems to settle their deals. Almost every deal has two sides – one party pays  the other party delivers whatever is being bought. For these users  the difficulty arises where there is no mechanism to co-ordinate the two sides. The party paying is thus exposed to the risk that the counterparty fails to deliver  and vice versa. In other words  there is often no mechanism to ensure delivery-versus-payment. In securities markets this is by now a relatively familiar issue. More recently  the need to tackle the similar problem which arises when settling foreign exchange deals has come to be appreciated. In both cases the value of the deals being settled is so substantial that the resulting settlement risks can be of a size to cause systemic concern. The second set of problems concerns one particular category of system users – namely banks  who also typically provide the payment and settlement systems. Until quite recently  the standard form of settlement was end-of-day net settlement. That is to say  all the payments and receipts between banks were allowed to accumulate during the day  to be settled by a transfer of the smaller  net amount at the end of the day. Banks liked this arrangement because it meant they could hold smaller balances on their accounts at the central bank. But its systemic weakness was that it usually required participants in the clearing to grant unsecured  uncontrolled and unlimited credit to other participants during the period until final settlement occurs. It is quite common for the credit thereby extended to a single counterparty to exceed a bank’s entire capital. Implicitly  the participants in the clearing are assuming that the central bank would be forced to come to the rescue if problems arose. BIS Review 81/1997 - 9 - Over the past few years  considerable effort has been devoted to alleviating these sources of systemic risk  and solutions are now being implemented. Solutions to protect users of the systems include introducing improved delivery versus payment mechanisms for securities markets and the possible introduction of some new form of multi-currency settlement arrangement for foreign exchange markets. Solutions to protect system providers include the introduction of tighter internal controls within traditional end-of-day settlement systems or  in an increasing number of cases  the replacement of such traditional systems by so-called RTGS arrangements. In these real-time gross settlement systems  individual transactions are settled one-by-one throughout the day rather than being allowed to accumulate  thereby attempting to get to the heart of the problem by removing the exposures between banks. As a result of these major efforts  payment and settlement arrangements all over the world are – gradually – becoming safer. IV. International Monetary Arrangements The nature of international monetary arrangements has also changed dramatically over the past two and a half decades. Once again  the driving force has been the growing power of market forces  and the recognition on the part of monetary authorities of the need to work with these forces  rather than to resist them. The Bretton Woods system  which lasted until the early 1970s  was based on decisions reached by collective agreement among governments. Exchange rates were fixed within narrow margins  with changes being possible only by international agreement in conditions of “fundamental disequilibrium”. International liquidity was externally supplied through gold  reserve currencies or  latterly  collective decisions to allocate Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). The adjustment mechanism worked through governments managing domestic demand so as to keep their current accounts close to balance (capital account restrictions were tolerated or even encouraged). By the beginning of the 1970s  the difficulties of maintaining such a government-led system were becoming increasingly apparent. International transactions were growing in importance  and countries were less willing to have their domestic macro-economic objectives subordinated to considerations of fixed exchange rates and balance-of-payments equilibrium. This issue came to a head in the late 1960s  when the United States was not prepared to adopt restrictive domestic policies to stem a dollar outflow when it was trying to finance domestic social reforms and the Vietnam war at the same time; and its partner countries were unwilling to accept the domestic inflationary consequences of a continued peg to the US dollar. Meanwhile  capital flows were increasing in volume as international financial markets expanded  and market participants found ways around pre-existing capital controls. The result was that private markets had growing means (and incentives) to challenge officially-maintained exchange rate pegs. Central bank reserves were increasingly inadequate to resist such pressures  despite the introduction in 1970 of a Special Drawing Rights (SDR facility) at the IMF. As is well-known by now  the combined effects of these trends was to bring about the demise of the fixed exchange rate (Bretton Woods) system in 1973. Thereafter it was quickly recognised that the most effective role for central banks and other public authorities was to make the new market-driven system work as efficiently as possible  working with rather than against the grain of market forces. BIS Review 81/1997 - 10 - Each of the three main elements of the international monetary system is now “market- led”.5 Exchange rates are floating  except where governments have taken a conscious decision to use the exchange rate as an anti-inflationary anchor  or where they are pursuing other goals (e.g. monetary union in Europe). Liquidity is demand-driven  with creditworthy governments able to borrow the reserves they need  and private markets being much more important to the availability of liquidity than central banks. And the adjustment mechanism is largely the consequence of market forces and private capital flows  which now provide the disciplining mechanism that previously operated through intergovernmental discussion and pressures. The fact that market forces are now more important in the operation of the international monetary system has probably avoided some types of problem  but it has highlighted others. For example  exchange rates have often fluctuated over wider ranges than can be justified by fundamentals. Inflation has sometimes reached dangerously high levels (e.g. following the oil price increase in the 1970s). And some countries have found themselves in a vicious circle of currency crisis and domestic financial strains. The conclusion from this experience has been to underline the essentially unitary nature of financial stability. The growing links among markets mean that domestic economic stability  the stability of the international monetary system  and the robustness of financial institutions and markets are closely tied together. The achievement of international stability therefore depends on actions on a number of fronts: the pursuit of effective stability-oriented macro-economic policies; adequate prudential supervision of financial institutions and markets  and a co-operative approach by monetary authorities where their domestic policies “interface”  i.e. in exchange rate relationships and the agreement of international regulatory policies. V. Concluding Comments What of the future? Where are the trends that have been described in this paper likely to lead? And how can public policy best equip itself to provide the stable financial environment that is most conducive to the development of the real economy? Predictions are always hazardous  but certain propositions can be made with reasonable confidence. Firstly  financial innovation will continue at a rapid pace  and global financial markets will become even more integrated  efficient and complete. The capacity of governments to resist market trends or pursue unsustainable policies will shrink further. Secondly  as a consequences  there will be a premium in firm  transparent and credible anchors for policy. Achieving price stability will be easier (though not easy) if market participants know what the authorities are trying to achieve and how they are going about it (and if there is an effective market discipline on the authorities to prevent backsliding). A third proposition which it seems safe to advance is that there will be an intensified search for ways to ensure systemic stability while fostering a competitive and efficient banking system. The plethora of financial system crises in recent years6 has amply illustrated the costs of lax practices in the financial sector. At the same time  there is a recognition that any indiscriminate expansion of safety net arrangements creates moral hazard problems  while excessive regulation leads to inefficiencies. My expectation is that regulatory economics will become a fruitful area of research for central bankers and financial supervisors. The goal will be to develop a regulatory structure that has as its anchor the replication of market disciplines  while at the same time providing protection Padoa-Schioppa  Tommaso and Fabrizio Saccomanni: ""Managing a Market-Led Global Financial System""  Banca Goldstein  Morris: ""The Case for an International Banking Standard""  Institute for International Economics  5 d'Italia  Mimeo. 6 Washington  April 1997. BIS Review 81/1997 - 11 - against the systemic transmission of instability. Transparency and disclosure have an obvious role to play here. Fourthly  and lastly  the international monetary system. Here  too  the power of market forces seems likely to grow. This has the potential for beneficial consequences insofar as bad policies are disciplined and good policies are rewarded. But it would be naive to suggest that market forces always get it right. My expectation is that efforts will need to be devoted to promoting greater stability in the market-led international monetary system. The bulk of these efforts will be in the direction of improving policies (and their mutual consistency) and making markets more transparent (e.g. through better information). But it cannot be excluded that more direct measures will be required to limit damaging exchange rate fluctuations or contain the cost of currency crises. Taken together  this presents a full agenda for central bank policy-makers. I noted at the outset of this lecture that “the last twenty-five years have been an eventful time for central banking”. The years ahead promise to be no less eventful. BIS Review 81/1997"
r970918a,1997-09-18,https://www.bis.org/review/r970918a.pdf,Bank of Japan's August review of monetary and economic trends in Japan (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  26 Aug 97),BANK OF JAPAN  MONTHLY ECONOMIC REVIEW  26/8/97.,Bank of Japan’s August review of monetary and economic trends in Japan BANK OF JAPAN  MONTHLY ECONOMIC REVIEW  26/8/97. Japan’s economy continues on a moderate recovery trend. Production and income are showing firmness although the effects of the consumption tax hike remain. With respect to final demand  public-sector investment has been on a decreasing trend  and housing investment has declined. Meanwhile  net exports have recently been on an increasing trend  and business fixed investment has been rising steadily. Despite the continued influence of the consumption tax hike  the recovery trend of personal consumption does not seem to have been hindered given the improvement in labor market conditions and income formation. Industrial production has been firm. Meanwhile  prices have remained stable on the whole  and the growth of monetary aggregates has continued at around 3.0 per cent year to year. With regard to personal consumption  outlays for travel have continued to increase moderately. However  passenger-car sales marked the fourth month of consecutive decline year to year from April and sales of electrical appliances are also negative year to year. Sales at department stores and supermarkets continued to be below the previous year’s level. These reflect some temporary factors  such as the typhoons which hit Japan in June and July  in addition to the continued reaction to the surge in demand ahead of the consumption tax hike. However  given that labor market conditions as well as income formation are improving steadily  albeit moderately  the recovery trend in personal consumption does not seem to have been hindered. Among leading indicators of business fixed investment  machinery orders have been increasing steadily  although at a somewhat slower pace compared to the sharp rise in the second half of 1996. The increase in the construction floor area has recently been weak  but it is following a moderate recovery trend. With respect to housing investment  housing starts in terms of the seasonally- adjusted annual rate reached a substantially high level in the fourth quarter 1996  partly reflecting the stepped-up demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate. Later  they declined in reaction. Housing starts recorded around 1.5 million in spring 1997  but fell to 1.34 million in June  the lowest level recorded since January 1993. Regarding public-sector investment  the amount of public works contracted has recently picked up somewhat from the level recorded in early 1997 owing to orders included in the supplementary budget for fiscal 1996. However  public-sector investment has been following a declining trend on average  reflecting the restrained budget for fiscal 1997. Against the background of the steady overseas demand and the yen’s depreciation to date  real exports stayed firm in July after having increased significantly in the second quarter reflecting some additional temporary factors. Real imports had been stagnant since April  but rose in July reflecting the rise in imports of foodstuffs and airplanes  in addition to the increasing trend of information-related goods. As a result  the real trade surplus stopped rising in July after the significant increase in the second quarter. The nominal current-account surplus showed a large expansion in the second quarter 1997  partly reflecting the decline in crude oil prices since early 1997.Industrial production in the second quarter has been firm and remained virtually unchanged after recording high growth during the second half of 1996 and the first quarter 1997. Despite the decline in demand following the surge ahead of the consumption tax hike  factors BIS Review 82/1997 - 2 - such as the substantial increase in exports and the rebuilding of inventories have supported production. Production is expected to increase slightly in July and August compared to the second quarter. Meanwhile  inventories are at appropriate levels on the whole  despite some accumulation in industries such as in automobiles. Labor market conditions have continued to improve on the whole. Although the unemployment rate remains at a high level  the growth in nominal wages has been increasing and the year-to-year employment growth has started to gather pace  albeit gradually  reflecting the increase in production and corporate profits. Prices remained stable on the whole  excluding the effect of the consumption tax hike. Although downward pressures remain  including that from the decline in import prices  as well as that from technological innovation in electrical machinery  domestic wholesale prices (adjusted for seasonal electricity rates) have remained virtually unchanged. This reflects the moderate improvement in overall domestic supply and demand conditions. The year-to-year declines in corporate service prices are narrowing steadily on the whole  partly owing to the improvement in supply and demand conditions  particularly for real estate rents and information services  although leasing charges continue to decline. Consumer prices (nationwide  excluding perishables) overall are marginally above the previous year’s level mainly because the year-to- year declines in goods prices have narrowed. The growth in monetary aggregates  measured in terms of the year-to-year growth of M2 + CDs average outstanding  has been growing at around 3 per cent. Regarding money market rates  the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) has moved at a level slightly below the official discount rate. The 3-month CD rate has stayed at around 0.55 - 0.60 per cent. Meanwhile  the long-term government bond yield rose to 2.65 - 2.70 per cent in late May. Later  it started to decline as the market confirmed the moderate pace of the economic recovery  and reached a historically low level below 2.1 per cent in mid August. With respect to bank lending rates  the short-term prime lending rate has remained at a record low level of 1.625 per cent since September 1995. The long-term prime lending rate was raised by 0.6 percentage points in May  and was then lowered by 0.2 percentage points both in June and July to 2.7 per cent. (The record low level is 2.5 per cent.) In these circumstances  short and long-term contracted interest rates on new loans and discounts (up to June) have moved at record low levels. On the stock exchange  the Nikkei 225 stock average moved at around ¥20 000 - 21 000 between May and July 1997  but later declined  reflecting such factors as the fall in U.S. stock prices. Recently  it has been moving at around ¥19 000. In the foreign exchange market  the yen appreciated to ¥110 to the U.S. dollar in the first half of June. The yen later depreciated slightly  and has recently stayed at around ¥115 - 120. Meanwhile  the yen has also been appreciating against the Deutsche Mark since May  and recently has moved at around ¥63 - 65. BIS Review 82/1997

I. Introduction As you are all aware  the Diet passed the new Bank of Japan Law on June 11  which will come into effect on April 1  1998. It has been the perennial wish of the Bank of Japan to revise the current Bank of Japan Law  which was legislated during World War II  to accommodate the significant changes that have occurred in the economic and financial environment and to make the Law able to withstand future changes in the environment. Revision of the Law was also indispensable for rebuilding the entire Japanese financial system so as to meet global standards. This revision built on the two principles of independence and transparency is thus a notable step in the 115 years of the Bank’s history and also for reforming the financial system of Japan. The Bank of Japan Law holds great significance as one of the basic laws governing Japan’s economic and financial activities. Looking back  this important revision was achieved in approximately one year from the start of discussions in spring 1996 owing to the support and efforts of many people  including Prime Minister Hashimoto  Finance Minister Mitsuzuka  and other government officials  members of parliament  and members of the Advisory Group on the Central Bank (an advisory panel to the Prime Minister) and the Financial System Research Council (an advisory committee to the Minister of Finance). Many words of encouragement as well as criticism were heard from the financial and business circles and the general public  including perhaps some of you who are here today. I would like to take this opportunity to express  on behalf of the Bank  our heartfelt gratitude to all. Naturally  the reform of the Bank of Japan is not consummated merely by the revision of the Law. We at the Bank of Japan believe it essential that we continue our efforts to conduct appropriate policy and operational management  cognizant of the responsibilities entrusted to us by the people. We are determined to promote  in line with the aim of the revision of the Law  wide-ranging reforms to further improve the transparency of policy management and the efficiency of the Bank’s operational management. Today  I would first like to discuss recent monetary and economic conditions and the Bank’s current monetary policy management. I will then explain the new framework of monetary policy under the new Law and how the Bank intends to manage monetary policy. II. Recent Monetary and Economic Conditions and Monetary Policy Management A. Recent economic and price developments and monetary policy management I would like to start with the recent domestic economic condition. Japan’s economy is currently at a phase in which the downward pressures of fiscal tightening appear strongest  with personal consumption and housing investment declining in reaction to the stepped-up demand before the consumption tax rate was raised. However  in view of the firm developments in production and improvements in corporate profits and household income  the Bank judges that the economy continues to follow a moderate recovery BIS Review 82/1997 - 2 - trend. The results of the June Tankan—Short-term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan  which were released two days ago  for the most part confirmed this view. The question is whether the virtuous circle of demand  production  and income  which has been developing steadily  will keep its momentum and whether  as a result  the economy will gain further momentum for a self-sustained recovery despite the downward pressures of fiscal tightening. The key to this will be developments in business fixed investment and personal consumption  which  according to the Tankan results and other indicators  can be analyzed as follows. Firms’ projections of revenues and profits and their plans for fixed investment indicate that recovery in business conditions will remain moderate for smaller firms  especially for those in the non-manufacturing sector. However  for firms as a whole  revenues and profits continue to be on an upward trend  especially for major firms  supported by increasing exports and buoyant demand for information technology-related goods and services. Fixed investment plans are also being revised upward. If this trend continues  the recovery in business conditions can be expected to spread to smaller firms. Employment and income are showing moderate but steady improvement  and bonus payments in summer 1997 are likely to enjoy a sizable rise. While personal consumption will inevitably be affected by the rise in the consumption tax rate and by the discontinuation of the special tax reduction  it is unlikely that the trend of recovery will be hampered considering the improvements in the income environment. Thus  the virtuous circle  generated by a recovery in private demand  is still at work. The Bank is  therefore  of the view that the current slowdown in demand will only be temporary and that it is likely that the economic recovery will continue. It is  however  necessary to continue to monitor closely consumer behavior and business activity. Prices remained virtually unchanged in April and May after the immediate effects of the rise in the consumption tax rate are discounted. The Bank will continue to monitor price developments closely  but expects prices to remain stable for some time  reflecting the recent appreciation of the yen and stabilized crude oil prices. In the management of current monetary policy  the Bank will continue to monitor economic developments closely  placing emphasis on further strengthening the foundations of the economic recovery. B. The thinking behind the Bank’s easy stance of monetary policy I have heard various questions and criticisms with regard to the easy stance of monetary policy  which the Bank has continued with a view to strengthening the foundations of the economic recovery. Therefore  I would next like to share with you the thinking behind the current stance of monetary policy. First  there is the question of why the Bank has not changed its policy stance since 1995  when it lowered the official discount rate to 0.5 percent  despite a gradual recovery of the economy. Indeed  compared to 1995  concern about a deflationary spiral has subsided and economic activity has improved significantly. The purpose of the drastic monetary easing BIS Review 82/1997 - 3 - measures was to prevent an occurrence of a deflationary spiral  to strengthen the confidence of firms and households in the economic outlook  and to thereby place the Japanese economy on a path of self-sustained recovery. As you are aware  the Japanese economy is faced with the medium to long-term challenges of overcoming the after-effects of the bursting of the economic “bubble” and reforming its industrial structure. The economy has therefore had to achieve a recovery while addressing these weighty challenges. Further  since the latter half of 1996  measures for fiscal consolidation have been implemented  including a reducing of public-sector investment and a raising of the consumption tax rate. In order for the economy to attain noninflationary  sustainable growth under such circumstances  the forces of the self-sustained recovery achieved in the private sector need to be further strengthened. It is therefore the Bank’s judgment that  at this point  it is necessary to monitor economic developments carefully bearing this in mind. Second  there has been criticism that  from the viewpoint of income distribution  the current low interest rates are putting the general public at a disadvantage. The Bank is fully aware of the difficult situation faced by those households which depend heavily on interest income. However  various types of income  whether it be wages  interest  or pensions  are distributed from the total output produced by economic activity. Therefore  without growth of the total output  sources of such income will not be generated. If the policy interest rate is raised before economic activity is sufficiently revitalized and  as a result  the economy is adversely affected  long-term interest rates may actually decline. It will then be difficult to say how the average level of short and long-term deposit interest rates will be affected. What I wish to emphasize is that in order for the overall level of interest rates to rise  there must have been the requisite improvement in the economic activity. Third  there have been concerns that low interest rates may encourage an outflow of domestic funds. In discussing this point  it must be remembered that the relationship between cross-border interest rate differentials and capital flows under the present floating exchange rate system differs from that under the fixed exchange rate system. Under the latter  there is no foreign exchange risk. Therefore  funds tend to flow to economies with higher interest rates. This is precisely why  under that system  strict regulation of capital flows was necessary. Under the floating exchange rate system  however  such capital flows do not necessarily occur. Even if one attempts to profit from a differential between domestic and overseas interest rates  the profit can be wiped out instantly with even a slight shift in the exchange rate. For example  if overseas interest rates rise  widening interest rate differentials  capital outflows may initially occur  causing the foreign currency to appreciate and the domestic currency to depreciate. After some time  however  expectations will emerge that the value of the foreign currency will start to decline. At that point  the benefits of investing in the foreign currency will have decreased significantly. Thus  when foreign exchange risk is taken into consideration  a situation in which the expected rate of return on foreign currency investment is substantially higher than that on domestic investment cannot be sustained. Under the floating exchange rate system  therefore  exchange rate fluctuations will apply the brakes to any one-sided capital flow. The long-term interest rate differential between Japan and the United States has been around 2 to 4 percent in recent years  and has widened in this time. It is true that during this time investment in foreign bonds has increased. BIS Review 82/1997 - 4 - Yet this has not depleted funds in Japan or caused domestic interest rates to remain at a high level. With global capital flows as active as they are today  the mechanism of the floating exchange rate system will function only more expeditiously. In other words  the speed of market adjustments has accelerated. What is critical in these circumstances is the occurrence of a capital flight  which may be triggered by a loss of market confidence in a country’s economic policy management resulting from an inflation or recession in that country. In order to prevent this from occurring in Japan today  it is essential to strengthen the foundations of the economic recovery and to achieve noninflationary  sustainable growth. In this connection  some argue that the revision of the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law  together with the low interest rates  may accelerate capital outflow. The Bank intends to monitor carefully the effects of the revision on the markets. However  as I have just explained  the Bank believes that there is little possibility of a disruptive capital outflow occurring simply as a result of the interest rate differentials between Japan and abroad. Rather  a more serious problem to consider would be the emergence of a “transaction flight.” Should market participants decide for certain reasons that overseas markets are more attractive and beneficial to the conducting of transactions  even financial and capital transactions between residents  which have conventionally been conducted in Japan—for example  securities transactions between domestic firms and households—may shift overseas. Although this will not induce an outflow of capital  transactions will be carried out abroad and the subsequent business opportunities will be transferred overseas. Should this trend continue  it might lead to a hollowing out of Japan’s financial markets. This is why the “Big Bang” deregulation package must be implemented apace with the revision of the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law  to enhance the attractiveness of domestic financial markets and services. III. The New Framework of Monetary Policy under the New Bank of Japan Law To summarize what I have said so far  the Bank of Japan is managing monetary policy with a view to placing the Japanese economy on a path of noninflationary  sustainable growth. While this has always been the objective of monetary policy under the current Bank of Japan Law  it is stipulated more explicitly by the new Law  which will come into effect on April 1  1998. Various revisions have also been incorporated in the new Law to ensure the achievement of this objective. I would  therefore  like to discuss the new framework of monetary policy under the new Bank of Japan Law and how we intend to make use of the new framework  firstly with regard to the objectives  secondly the instruments  and finally the management of monetary policy  including the decision-making procedures. A. Monetary Policy Objectives 1. Price stability I would first like to discuss the objectives of monetary policy. The new Bank of Japan Law stipulates that the objective of monetary policy is “to contribute to the sound development of the national economy through the pursuit of price stability.” The sound development of the national economy is a common objective of all economic policies. As the objective of monetary policy is to contribute to the achievement of BIS Review 82/1997 - 5 - this ultimate objective through price stability  its direct objective will be to ensure price stability. Price stability  together with the stability of the financial system  is a precondition for money to smoothly perform its intrinsic functions. As the issuer and controller of money  maintenance of price stability is an inherent role of the central bank. It is  however  not easy to define price stability. There are diverse types of price indicators: for example  the Consumer Price Index  Wholesale Price Indexes  and the GDP deflator. Each of these has its limitation  such as the range of items covered or the timing of release. Further  many studies have been conducted more recently on the possibility that these indicators offer a substantially biased measurement of prices. Even with a perfectly reliable price indicator  there will still be disparate views regarding what specific percentage of price increases would be acceptable. Thus  it is difficult to define specifically what is meant by price stability. We at the Bank will continue to study this issue  including the interpretation of price indices. It becomes clearer  however  if the matter is considered from the viewpoint of the implications of price stability for economic activity. “Prices”  sometimes referred to as “prices in general”  are the average level of the prices of individual goods and services  and serve as a tool to measure the relative rise or fall in the price of individual goods and services. Therefore  if prices in general were to fluctuate significantly  firms and households would not be able to conduct efficient investment and consumption activity. For example  in an inflationary economy  even if the price of a firm’s product rises  the firm will not be able to judge whether this will bring about increased earnings in the future  or whether it merely reflects a rise in prices in general with the price increase being offset by an increase in wages and cost of raw materials. In such an economy  firms will  in the long term  inevitably become cautious with their investments. Furthermore  when there are concerns about inflation  people will tend to curtail their spending. The same situation may arise in the case of a deflationary economy. One possible example was the Japanese economy in 1995  when there were concerns about a deflationary spiral. This line of thinking leads to the conclusion that ensuring price stability means maintaining a situation in which firms and households need not be concerned about a continuing rise or fall in prices in the future when planning their investment and consumption. 2. The relationship between price stability and the economy Having defined price stability  there may still be questions about the relationship between price stability and other important policy objectives or economic variables. For example  should we not care about the economy and economic growth as long as prices remain stable? What is the relationship between prices and foreign exchange rates or asset prices? First  with regard to the relationship between prices and the economy  it is true that in the short term  it seems as if higher economic growth could be realized if a certain level of price increase were allowed. However  it has recently been proved both theoretically and empirically that this effect will only be temporary. If such a process is repeated  the economy may well fall into an intractable situation of stagflation  in which the economy falls back into a recession but high inflation BIS Review 82/1997 - 6 - remains. This was the economic disease that plagued the industrialized countries of Europe and the United States from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. In the light of that experience  there is a common understanding today that price stability is a precondition for sustainable economic growth. Second  how are foreign exchange rates and asset prices to be considered in the context of monetary policy management? They are important factors that require due attention. However  if their stability is made a direct objective of monetary policy  the stability of the domestic economy and of prices in general may be undermined. This is because land prices and exchange rates reflect certain factors which prices in general do not. Specifically  land prices incorporate changes in the productivity of land and in the expected rate of return. Exchange rates  in the long term  are adjusted by the market mechanism in accordance with the differentials between domestic and overseas inflation rates  or in other words  changes in the purchasing power parities. Any attempt to control such factors forcibly through macroeconomic policies will most likely cause distortions in other sectors of the economy. Needless to say  fluctuations in exchange rates and asset prices will affect the economy in various ways. It has been a valuable lesson of the bubble economy that significant fluctuations in asset prices may be a sign of some irregularities in economic activity or excessive expectations of economic entities. Therefore  while it would not be appropriate to attempt any rigid control of asset prices and exchange rates  the Bank will pay due attention to developments in them in managing monetary policy aimed at achieving the objective of price stability. B. Monetary policy instruments Let me next discuss the instruments of monetary policy under the new Bank of Japan Law. Economic textbooks often refer to (1) the official discount rate  (2) open market operations  and (3) reserve requirements as the three major monetary policy instruments. These are in fact the means with which the Bank of Japan implements monetary policy  and this will remain unchanged under the new Law. The revised Law  however  incorporates the following changes. First  the new Law explicitly stipulates that “guidelines for money market control through various measures such as buying and selling of bills or bonds”—that is  the Bank’s basic policy for open market operations  or in other words  the Bank’s policy for the guiding of money market rates—are to be decided by the Bank of Japan’s Policy Board  while in the current Law  there is no explicit stipulation concerning such policy. Second  while the current Law stipulates that determination and altering of reserve requirements must be approved by the Minister of Finance  the new Law abolishes this approval system. With these changes  all three instruments of monetary policy—including official discount rate policy  which is already stipulated by the current Law as a matter for decision by the Policy Board——will be spelt out explicitly as matters to be decided by the Policy Board. Reserve requirements have been altered less frequently as the means of open market operations developed. I would therefore like to discuss in detail the historical background and the Bank’s view of official discount rate changes and of the guiding of money BIS Review 82/1997 - 7 - market rates  with emphasis on how the Bank will utilize these two means of implementing monetary policy. 1. Relationship between official discount rate changes and the guiding of money market rates For many years  monetary policy was in most cases implemented in Japan by changing the official discount rate. This was because the financial markets were not sufficiently developed and  under these circumstances  deposit interest rates and lending rates were linked to the official discount rate. The situation changed gradually from the 1980s. The financial markets began to grow both in quality and quantity  with massive issuance of government securities and introduction of new financial instruments such as certificates of deposit (CDs) and commercial paper (CP). As a result  interest rates started to fluctuate freely reflecting the supply and demand conditions for funds  and accordingly  an environment was established in which the effects of monetary policy would permeate via market interest rates. In response to such changes in the financial markets  the Bank has devised various changes to its monetary policy management. For example  in the buying and selling of bills and bonds  the Bank abolished the system of conducting operations at the rate quoted by the Bank  and adopted a more transparent bidding system. The Bank also improved the efficiency of its market operations by shortening the lag between the announcement of operations and the settlement of funds. In 1991  the Bank abolished window guidance  a method in which the Bank gave direct guidance to financial institutions regarding the amount by which they increased their lendings  and provided for an environment in which the functions of interest rates could be used to influence the behavior of financial institutions. In addition  in 1994  deregulation of deposit interest rates was completed. This meant that the official discount rate no longer performed the role of directly bringing changes to deposit interest rates and lending rates  and instead  the significance of the guiding of money market rates increased. Consequently  on March 31  1995  the Bank introduced a new system to utilize the guiding of money market rates as a means of monetary policy which is  by itself  as significant as the official discount rate. This is a system whereby the Bank publicly announces its policy for market operations after it has been approved by the Policy Board. The policy is stated with regard to the guiding level of overnight call money rates  the Bank’s target rate in market operations. For example  the Bank might state that it “expects that the call money rate will remain on average slightly below the official discount rate.” While this method of monetary policy implementation had already taken root in the United States  it was the first attempt for Japan back in March 1995. At the time of this first attempt  it so happened that Germany had lowered its official discount rate a day earlier  and it cannot be denied that the market could not quite understand and assimilate the Bank’s policy intention. The Bank’s use of the guiding of money market rates  however  has gradually gained understanding and has taken root in Japan as well. In fact  when the Bank encouraged a decline in the market rates on July 7  1995  the policy intent permeated smoothly through the market without causing any confusion. BIS Review 82/1997 - 8 - The provision of the new Law stating that the policy for the guiding of money market rates be determined by the Policy Board reinforces the recent emphasis placed by the Bank on the market mechanism. What significance  then  will the official discount rate have in this age of marketization? Central banks overseas hold various views as to the relationship between official discount rate changes and the guiding of money market rates  and it is difficult to arrive at a single conclusion. However  examples overseas suggest that official discount rate changes continue to play an important role even in this age of economic and financial marketization and interest rate liberalization. Their function is to communicate plainly to everybody the changes in monetary policy. In order to maintain the efficacy of monetary policy amid the progress of marketization  it becomes even more necessary to win public understanding of and confidence in the central bank’s economic outlook and the thinking behind its monetary policy management. In this regard  the easy-to-understand announcement effects of the official discount rate are valuable for monetary policy management based on the functioning of the market mechanism. I am sometimes asked which of the two would be employed first  the guiding of money market rates or official discount rate change. However  there is no fixed rule as to which should be implemented first. In some cases  the Bank may change the level it has set for the guiding of money market rates several times before changing the official discount rate  and in other cases  the Bank may first strongly indicate its policy intention by changing the official discount rate  and then guide the money market rates accordingly. For the reasons I have just explained  the Bank believes it necessary to make effective use of both official discount rate changes and the guiding of money market rates. C. Monetary policy management 1. Strengthening of the functions of the Policy Board I would now like to discuss monetary policy management  focusing on the decision-making process of monetary policy. The new Bank of Japan Law incorporates major revisions aimed at strengthening the functions of the Policy Board  the Bank of Japan’s highest decision-making body. First  the composition of the Board is altered significantly. The current Policy Board consists of seven members: the Governor of the Bank of Japan  four appointed members  and two government members without voting rights  representing the Ministry of Finance and the Economic Planning Agency. The new Policy Board  however  will consist of nine members: the Governor and the two Deputy Governors of the Bank of Japan and six deliberative members. The main features of the changes are that  first  there will be no government members on the Board. Second  while the current appointed members must be selected from each of the four fields of city banking  regional banking  commerce and industry  and agriculture  the new deliberative members can be selected from among a much broader population  without any restriction on the fields they represent  so long as they are experts  including those on economy or finance. Third  in order to ensure interactive linkage between monetary policy decision-making and the Bank’s business operations  the number of members BIS Review 82/1997 - 9 - from the management of the Bank is increased from one to three. A balance is to be struck  however  by appointing six deliberative members so that the three members from the management will not constitute the majority. Also  the powers of the Policy Board  which remained somewhat ambiguous under the current Law  are clarified. One example is the explicit stipulation of the three instruments of monetary policy as matters for decision by the Policy Board  which I discussed earlier. In addition to these revisions  we at the Bank will do our best to ensure that the Policy Board can fully function. For example  meetings of the executive are currently organized at the Bank of Japan pursuant to the Bank’s by-laws. The meetings are attended by the Governor  the Deputy Governor  and the Executive Directors  and  as the executive body of the Bank  meets to discuss important matters related to the Bank’s daily business operations and to deliberate on matters on which it needs to consult with the Policy Board. The meetings thus by no means represent decision-making opportunities. However  the holding of the meetings has invited criticism that the Bank perhaps has two decision-making processes. Under the new Law  therefore  the meetings will be abolished to prevent any misunderstanding regarding the procedures of monetary policy decision-making. As a result  meetings of the executive will not deliberate on monetary control issues before they are discussed by the Policy Board. The entire procedure related to monetary policy  from judging the economic and financial conditions to policy decision-making  will be concentrated at the Policy Board. 2. Holding of regular Policy Board meetings on monetary control matters With the powers of the Policy Board strengthened in this manner  the new Law provides for regular meetings of the Policy Board on monetary control matters as well as disclosure of summaries of discussions and transcripts (detailed records of discussions) of the meetings. The main aim of holding regular Policy Board meetings on monetary control matters is to ensure the stability of the financial markets. Currently  the Policy Board meets every Tuesday and Friday. However  the holding of ad hoc meetings means that there is the possibility that policy changes might be made at any time. That being the case  the markets inevitably become overly sensitive to various kinds of information  such as daily movements in economic indicators and individual statements by relevant people. In fact  on quite a few occasions  one piece of information has triggered speculation over monetary policy changes  leading to market disruption. It is indeed an intrinsic function of the financial markets to assimilate various kinds of information and to reflect them in the formation of interest rates. In order for this function to be played out in the most stable and efficient manner  however  it is important that undue speculation and market disruption be avoided. This will also be conducive to improving the efficacy of monetary policy. BIS Review 82/1997 - 10 - The new system of holding regular Board meetings on monetary control matters and of announcing the schedule of such meetings in advance has been devised based on such considerations. In determining the frequency of these regular meetings  due thought must be given to ensuring the timeliness of policy implementation as well as market stabilization. Although there is no need to preclude the possibility of ad hoc meetings  monetary policy decisions should in principle be made at the regular meetings in keeping with the purpose of the new system. If we look at the practices of other countries  the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meets the least often at eight times a year  the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England once a month  and the Central Bank Council of the German Bundesbank twice a month. The Bank will continue to study how best to run the Board meetings by considering such examples overseas and the aim of the new system. If I may add a word here  Policy Board meetings other than the regular meetings on monetary control matters will be held as necessary. Apart from determination of monetary policy  the Policy Board will also discuss and decide on a number of matters  such as issues related to the financial and payments systems as well as those related to the operational and organizational management of the Bank. The Policy Board currently meets twice weekly  and it is likely to meet frequently under the new Law as well. What is of special note in the new system is that  while Policy Board meetings will be held frequently  the opportunities to hold intensive discussions and decide on monetary control matters are specified. 3. Disclosure of summaries of discussions and transcripts of Policy Board meetings I would now like to explain the new disclosure system of summaries of discussions and transcripts of the regular Policy Board meetings on monetary control matters. One of the main principles underlying the revision of the Bank of Japan Law is improvement of the transparency of monetary policy. To this end  the new Law provides for the disclosure of the summaries of discussions and the transcripts of the regular Policy Board meetings on monetary control matters. Disclosure of the summaries of discussions is aimed at gaining more fully the understanding and confidence of the market and the public regarding the Bank’s basic thinking underlying its monetary policy. The Bank  therefore  intends to prepare accurate and clear-cut summaries of the Board’s discussions on monetary and economic conditions and on monetary policy. The difficult issue is the timing of disclosure. Considering the purpose of the disclosure  it is desirable that the summaries of discussions be disclosed at the earliest possible moment. Yet  it would only be counterproductive should the disclosure invite market speculation or disruption. For example  let us assume that at a meeting held at the beginning of a month  heated discussions are held on the projected movement of an indicator which is to be released at the end of the month. If the summary of such discussions were disclosed before the release of the indicator  it might heighten speculation over future policy management. However  the summary should not be made ambiguous with the intention of avoiding such speculation. Therefore  the Bank will have to consider the earliest disclosure that will not undermine market stability. In the United States  the summary of discussions is disclosed approximately one to one and a half months after the meeting  and in the United Kingdom  within six weeks. These BIS Review 82/1997 - 11 - timings probably reflect the central banks’ desire to avoid undue speculation over discussions and policy decisions at future meetings. The transcripts of discussions at the meetings will have a somewhat different role from the summaries  although both are meant to enhance the transparency of monetary policy. While the summaries of discussions seek to promote better understanding of current policy management  the transcripts are a tool to enable a detailed review at a later date  as necessary  of the Policy Board’s policy management at a certain point in time. On the one hand  due attention must be given to ensuring that the disclosure of the transcripts does not hamper free and frank discussions at Policy Board meetings. On the other hand  however  if the disclosure is overly delayed  the significance of the disclosure may be greatly reduced. With these points in mind  the Bank intends to establish an effective disclosure system that makes the Bank sufficiently accountable to the public. The Bank has  to date  endeavored to explain as clearly as possible the basic thinking behind its monetary policy management at regular press conferences  before the Diet  in publications  in speeches  and at various other opportunities. Disclosure of the transcripts and the summaries of discussions of the Policy Board are added to these measures under the new Law  and this will equip the Bank of Japan with means that go beyond global standards to ensure the transparency of monetary policy. We at the Bank intend to make effective use of these means to win even greater public understanding of and confidence in the Bank’s policy management. 4. Relationship between the central bank and the Government Lastly  I would like to discuss the relationship between the Bank of Japan and the Government. The new Law allows Government representatives to attend Policy Board meetings on monetary control matters and to express their views when necessary. It also grants the Government representatives the right to make policy proposals regarding monetary control matters  including requests to postpone the Board’s vote on policies. Some suggest that these provisions will constrain the independence of the central bank. We at the Bank  however  do not take that view. First of all  the monetary policy of the Bank of Japan is designed to contribute to the sound development of the national economy in conjunction with the economic policy of the Government. The Bank therefore needs to ensure adequate communication with the Government in managing monetary policy  although the policy must be decided by the Bank on its own responsibility and judgment. What is important is that the relationship between the Bank and the Government in the determination of monetary policy be clear and transparent  and therefore under the new system  the Government’s views and the discussions and votes on Government proposals will be disclosed in the summaries of discussions. In addition  although the Government representatives have the right to “request” a postponement of the Board’s vote  they do not have the right to “instruct.” Whether to postpone the vote on policies as requested will be determined by a vote by the Policy Board. This new system is designed carefully from the viewpoint of ensuring the autonomy of the central bank in monetary policy management while also ensuring adequate communication between the Bank and the Government. We at the Bank intend to establish a clear  transparent  and constructive relationship with the Government to serve the purpose of the BIS Review 82/1997 - 12 - new system  believing that such a relationship will not interfere with the central bank’s autonomy. IV. Conclusion I hope that I have been able to make clear how specifically the two main principles of the new Bank of Japan Law  independence and transparency  will be embedded in the new central bank system. As I stated at the outset  the Bank intends to implement all possible measures as part of the Bank’s self-reform even before the new Law is effected  to accommodate the aims of the new Law. The Bank is currently studying a concrete mechanism for holding regular Policy Board meetings on monetary control matters and for disclosing the summaries of discussions at those meetings  which will be implemented as soon as preparations are completed. I wish to conclude by asking for your continued understanding and support. BIS Review 82/1997

Meyer  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  before the Fixed Income Summit of PSA  The Bond Market Trade Association held in Washington  D.C. on 12/9/97. Monetary Policy and the Bond Market: Complements or Substitutes? It is a pleasure to speak this afternoon at the Fixed Income Summit. To some analysts  a meeting of the heads of the top fifty government securities dealers would represent a concentration of influence over the U.S. economy that perhaps even surpasses that of the meeting I will attend on September 30. Indeed  some have argued that the activities of traders and investors in the bond market have become a major stabilizing force in the economy  even to the point of making the FOMC redundant. This premise suggests an interesting theme for my address this afternoon -- the connection  or maybe more appropriately the symbiosis  between policy makers and market participants. The Importance of Market Mechanisms The Federal Reserve has been most successful over the years when it has relied on market mechanisms to carry out its policy intent. Regulation Q  in its fixing of ceilings on deposit rates  distorted incentives and led to sudden and large swings in the pattern of intermediation. Selective credit controls  in retrospect  were a blunt instrument that was too unpredictable and extreme to use effectively. And the Board of Governors has found that reserve requirements  which represent a tax on depositories because our reserves do not bear interest  are best held steady at the lowest level consistent with the efficient implementation of policy. Instead  the Federal Reserve controls its balance sheet to influence a rate quoted by market participants any time that the reserve market is open -- the overnight federal funds rate. In truth  as you all know  movements in that rate have little direct significance  except to reserve managers and those relatively few others concerned with the overnight cost of funds. But how that rate gets transmitted along the term structure to yields on longer maturity instruments has broad significance that ultimately affects everyone in the economy. And that is where market participants come in. Policymakers’ influence is focused on the current short rate. It is the job of traders and investors to read our intentions from the public record  form their own judgments as to the course of economic activity and inflation that are based on  in addition to monetary policy  current and prospective fiscal policies and demand and supply shocks  and translate all that into action as expressed in the prices of a bewildering array of debt  equity  and derivative instruments. Varieties of Errors While the market activities of traders and investors can importantly reinforce and strengthen the actions taken by the FOMC in the pursuit of its broad macroeconomic objectives  they cannot replace the FOMC. Sometimes  believe it or not  they turn out to complicate  rather than advance  the cause of monetary policy. Before I turn to the good the market does in complementing policy action  let me start by deflating the notion that an omniscient bond market always gets it right so as to render the FOMC redundant. Because many of the instruments in which you deal have long maturities  the judgments that have to be made to price them by necessity stretch well into the future. The scope for error can be large and the consequences costly. I think it is useful to separate the grounds for BIS Review 83/1997 - 2 - mistakes into two groups: market participants could be wrong about the economy  or wrong about policymakers’ objectives. Two examples can make this distinction clearer. For one  we know  after the fact  that most analysts misjudged the full extent to which unusual restraint on credit was exerting a drag on spending from around 1989 to 1993. Essentially  both households and firms recoiled from the explosion of debt in the 1980s. They were burdened by high interest service and took steps to bring their balance sheets into a more sustainable configuration. Lenders  too  had their own imbalances  brought on importantly by the real estate bust. Among them  banks drew back from extending loans to a wide variety of borrowers  including businesses. In this environment  spreads of private over public rates widened in the market  and borrowers and lenders who went to depositories were confronted with far less favorable terms than they had grown accustomed to. While Chairman Greenspan and his fellow policymakers identified the credit crunch in a fairly timely fashion  it took some time to appreciate the full force of its power. By my reading  in the aggregate  market participants were slower on the uptake. Thus  the policy easings of 1991 and 1992 were greeted with some skepticism as market participants apparently interpreted those actions as reflecting a lessened concern about inflation on the part of the Federal Reserve  rather than the appropriate response to a softening in aggregate demand. The effect of those mis-assessments was to produce a stunning steepening of the yield curve. The spread between long and short-term rates is often viewed as one of the most reliable cyclical indicators and a widening as a measure of the increased stimulus of monetary policy. But I viewed the widening in this episode as evidence of the reduced effectiveness of monetary policy in an environment where actions by bond-market participants were preventing long-term interest rates from adjusting in response to the policy-induced decline in short-term rates. At its peak in mid-1992  the long-term Treasury bond yielded 475 basis points over the three-month bill rate  about three times the average for the prior three decades. True  as the full dimension of the effects of the credit crunch became apparent  yields fell from those heights. But in the interim  monetary policy’s intentions were blunted by the market’s misreading of the economy. This probably prolonged the need for ease and further accentuated the required easing of the federal funds rate. As another example  I have spent enough of my career projecting near-term economic trends to be familiar with a forecaster’s favorite friend -- momentum. But momentum can easily be misjudged. It is easy to fall into the trap of presuming that what an economic actor did last is what that actor will do next. Thus  market prices tend to extrapolate that changes in monetary policy cluster in the same direction. This is a rule that works often enough  but  as a look back to 1994 and 1995 reminds us  not always. By mid-1994  the FOMC had substantially raised its intended federal funds rate  but market prices seemed to say that enough was not enough. The tightenings in May and August of that year  for example  were greeted by a roughly parallel shift up in money market futures rates  implying that the actions had not gotten the Federal Reserve any closer to the goal line -- instead  the goal line had been pushed back. And the Fed indeed did continue to tighten through early 1995. But by late 1994 and early 1995  the term structure spreads in financial markets remained very wide  implying an expectation of still significant further tightening. As a result  the restraint associated with the policy action was amplified. In retrospect  a tighter focus on fundamentals -- that policy was acting in a pre- emptive fashion to contain inflation  rather than an extrapolation of the sequence of recent policy actions -- would have helped to cap the rise in longer-term yields. BIS Review 83/1997 The Benefits of Market Mechanisms - 3 - While I have been speaking about all manner of misjudgments  I actually do have an economist’s inherent confidence in market mechanisms. Market participants do  on average  get it right and are rewarded accordingly  to the benefit of economic efficiency. Indeed  the pattern of those rewards sharpens skills in trading and forecasting  ensuring that these benefits will continue to accrue. For that reason  policymakers are well advised to heed the message from markets that are expressed in prices. What I find most intriguing is the notion that markets can carry some  and  in the extreme view  all of the load for monetary policymakers. To push it to an extreme  it’s as if the actions of the Federal Open Market Committee  of which I am a member  can be anticipated  augmented  and  perhaps  even replaced  by meetings of the Private Open Market Committee  of which you are members. There are two main advantages of these meetings of the Private Open Market Committee. First  members meet twenty-four hours a day  every business day of the year  so that the POMC can respond to every scrap of information on the economy  whether it be an official data release  a statement by an official  or a rumor about the future course of policy. Second  every participant can express the strength of his or her belief in a particular view by the amount of capital committed to the trade. Because of the inclusiveness of the market  a broad assortment of views about the workings of the economy can be reflected in prices. While the design of the FOMC fosters a similar diversity of views  virtually nonstop market trading allows prices to move before official policymakers can react. Of course  the FOMC delegates authority to the Chairman and  in this age of instantaneous communication  conference calls are always possible. But  practically  with a fixed calendar of FOMC meetings  a desire on our part for a systematic review of the situation to help our deliberations  and some inertia in decision making  markets will almost always be better positioned to react more quickly to news than the Federal Reserve. This speedy response  when right  puts in place stimulus or restraint sooner  perhaps lessening the need for us  ultimately  to move our policy instrument as much. In general  the more forward looking the bond market is with respect to future policy action  the shorter will be the lag from policy action to intended economic effect. In the absence of such a forward-looking response of long-term rates  short-term interest rates may have to move by more to achieve the same near-term impact on long-term interest rates and economic activity. Indeed  in those circumstances  the Federal Reserve would have to weigh carefully the effects on long rates of both the current and lagged levels of short rates so as to avoid the potential for an overshooting of short-term interest rates that would have adverse consequences for the economy. However  if long-term rates move swiftly in response to correctly anticipated policy  the required rise in short-term rates will be smaller and there will be less risk of overshooting. Thus  for the same reasons the Federal Reserve attempts to be pre-emptive in its monetary policy decisions  we would welcome pre-emptive pricing by market participants. But we must recognize that what markets are pricing is anticipated Federal Reserve action. If the prices are right  we will act to validate them. If the prices are wrong - built on the base of an incorrect view of the economy or Federal Reserve intentions -- we will prove them wrong and provide an anchor for the market to adjust to. It is also important to appreciate that the anticipatory contribution of the markets cannot be sustained unless the FOMC ratifies BIS Review 83/1997 - 4 - well-timed moves of the market. If the FOMC were to fail to do so  it would disconfirm the expectations on which the market move was based  making it less likely in the future that the market would play a constructive anticipatory role. Therefore  while forward-looking markets may change what we policy makers need to do  they will never eliminate the need for the FOMC to respond to changing economic developments. Some Lessons for Markets and Policymakers I hope that the important question that this discussion has been pointing to is obvious by now: How can we -- the Federal and the Private Open Market Committees -- operate to deliver the greatest good for the American economy while you respect your obligation to stakeholders to maximize their return? I think that there are two parts to the answer: We should work at arm’s length but with full information. By arm’s length  I mean that the information markets provide works best as an independent check on monetary policy decisions. If the FOMC were to tie mechanically our actions to market prices  then we would be placed in the sorry position of validating whatever whim that currently struck investors’ fancy. If you were to take our reading of the economy as if from a sacred text  the unique sources of information and skills that you have refined would go untapped. It is far better that we should treat each other warily so as to keep each other sharp. By full information  I mean that the Federal Reserve should do its best to read signals from markets and to communicate to markets its policy intentions. The Domestic and Foreign Open Market Desks of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are virtually in constant communication with market participants and routinely distill that information for their policy-making principals. My fellow governors and I routinely receive from our staff a translation of the term structure of Treasury yields into implied forward rates  volatility inferred from options prices  and paths for expected monetary policy action consistent with futures prices. Of late  the information we receive has included inferences drawn from quotes on the Treasury’s inflation protected securities. In principle  such information should be helpful in interpreting all manner of economic behavior  including the pricing of financial instruments and wage setting. As yet  I must admit that  in the eight months since the first issue  the volume of trade and the apparent lack of interest in related contracts on the futures market has been somewhat disappointing. The Treasury’s strong commitment to this product  reflected in the range of maturities that have and will be sold and the volume of securities sold  should do much to foster this market  as will the growing realization by market participants that indexed debt will represent an increasing share of the nation’s debt obligations. But even after we have reliable quotes on a more complete indexed term structure  considerable analysis must still be done before we can cull readings of inflation expectations and inflation risk from market prices. As you well appreciate  the spread of the yield on a nominal instrument over its inflation-protected counterpart inflation uncertainty  and differential risk characteristics. Until we have a long enough history to be more certain of the relative contributions of each  we must watch  wait  and learn. includes compensation for expected inflation  Communication must flow two ways. Over the past few years  I am pleased to say  the FOMC has significantly enhanced the information it provides to the public. That list includes announcing actions -- and the reasons underlying them -- within the day that the decisions are made and providing complete transcripts of meetings with a five year lag. We continue to release a comprehensive record of policy discussions six to eight weeks after each BIS Review 83/1997 - 5 - meeting. We now report the daily size of reserve operations within minutes of their completion  and we have lifted the last veil covering the inner sanctum of policy: Rather than speaking in tongues about “slight” or “somewhat” changes in reserve pressures  the FOMC now announces the intended federal funds rate when it is changed. In one respect  the distance covered in that change was not all that great  in that for most of this decade  the Federal Reserve has been rather explicit in signaling through its choice of open market operations whenever the FOMC elected to alter its intended rate. But compared to the borrowed reserves operating period of the latter half of the previous decade  the change has been dramatic. Rather than rely on Fed watchers employed by primary dealers to read the tea leaves of our daily interventions  we inform everyone  openly  and take responsibility for the level of short-term interest rates. By my reading  this is one circumstance in which virtue has proved more than its own reward. Over the past 3½ years  a financial innovation -- sweeps from retail deposits -- has complicated reserve operations. On average  depositories that have adopted sweeps have been able to reduce their effective reserve requirements by 80 to 90 percent. When aggregated over the entire banking system  the scale is staggering. By year-end  transactions deposits will probably have been reduced by nearly $¼ trillion as the result of the cumulative effect of retail sweeps  which is big even by Washington standards. Going by a simple rule of thumb  required reserves will be lower by about one-tenth that total. This innovation has made the technical job of implementing monetary policy from day to day more difficult. Simply  reserve requirements are no longer necessarily the binding determinant of reserve demand for many banks. When reserve requirements are in excess of clearing balances  volatile movements in clearing balances will have a small effect on the reserves market. However  when desired clearing balances dictate short-run movements in the demand for reserves  the reserve market  and therefore the federal funds rate  may become a bit more volatile late in the trading day. However  to the credit of my colleagues charged with determining daily open market operations and of market participants who have adjusted operations to the new environment  that volatility has been quite muted. Still  if markets had only daily open market operations to discern the FOMC’s intentions  the scope for misimpressions in this environment would be large. Because you can read press releases to learn our policy stance rather than the pattern of reserve additions or drains  there is much less chance for confusion. For pricing any instrument beyond overnight  market participants apparently find the intended federal funds rate to be more informative than the noisy effective federal funds rate. Nonetheless  it would be helpful to prevent a further increase in the volatility of the effective federal funds rate that might result from a further sweep-induced decline in required reserves. And a means is available to the Congress today to accomplish that end: The Federal Reserve should be permitted to pay interest on reserves. As it stands now  depositories resort to complicated means to evade our reserve requirements -- such as retail sweeps -- because our reserves are sterile and to do less would put them at a competitive disadvantage in a market where profit margins are paper thin. By paying interest on reserves  the incentive to engage in sweeps would be sharply reduced and the practice would likely diminish over time  if not end entirely. As a result  bankers could devote their attention to more productive pursuits  and reserve markets would be easier to read. Conclusion I can assure you that I view financial markets as a national resource. To be sure  they do not light the way to proper policy making as perfectly as true believers may assert. But there is information to be gotten  and it has been my experience that policy makers do try to BIS Review 83/1997 - 6 - extract it. For our part  we will try to preserve those benefits. For your part  the Private Open Market Committee does public good -- even if it is the by-product of the pursuit of personal profits -- when it views policy making with a skeptical eye. After all  it is only the best of friends who have the courage to point out the most sensitive of faults. BIS Review 83/1997

It isn’t every day that we have the opportunity to dedicate a new building devoted to the research and training that our young people need for conducting business in a global setting. This new facility -- the McColl Bulding -- has been equipped with state-of-the-art information technology that will enhance the ability of the faculty and students of Kenan-Flagler to prepare for an exciting future in our global economy. The University has made this important commitment at a time when our businesses and workers are confronting a dynamic set of forces that will influence our nation’s ability to compete worldwide in the years ahead. One of the most central of these forces is the rapid acceleration of computer and telecommunications technologies  which can be reasonably expected to appreciably raise our standard of living in the twenty-first century. In the short run  however  the fallout from rapidly changing technology is an environment in which the stock of plant and equipment with which most managers and workers interact is turning over increasingly rapidly  rendering a perception that human skills are becoming obsolete at a rate perhaps unprecedented in American history. I shall endeavor to place this most unusual phenomenon in the context of the broader changes in our economy and  hopefully  explain why the value of education  especially to enhance advanced skills  is so vital to the future growth of our economy. Wealth has always been created  virtually by definition  when individuals use their growing knowledge to interact with an expanding capital stock to produce goods and services of value. Assisted by the whole array of market prices  entrepreneurs seek to identify the types of products and services that individuals will value  especially the added value placed on products and services that customers find better tailored to their particular needs  delivered in shorter time frames  or improved in quality. This striving to unbundle the particular characteristics of goods and services in order to maximize their value to each individual inevitably results in the shift toward value created through the exploitation of ideas and concepts  rather than simply the utilization of physical resources and manual labor. Indeed  over the past century  by far the smallest part of the growth in America’s real gross domestic product reflects increased physical product measured in bulk or weight. Most of our gains have been the result of new insights into how to rearrange physical reality to achieve ever-higher standards of living. We have dramatically reduced the physical bulk of our radios  for example  by substituting transistors for vacuum tubes. New architectural  engineering  and materials technologies have enabled the construction of buildings with the same space  but far less physical material  than was required 50 or 100 years ago. Most recently  mobile phones have been significantly downsized as they have been improved. The increasing importance of new insights has  of course  raised the value of information creation and transfer in boosting standards of living. Thus  it should be no surprise that new computer and telecommunications products have been accorded particularly high value by consumers and business and  hence  why companies that successfully innovate in this field exhibit particularly high stock market values. BIS Review 83/1997 - 2 - Breakthroughs in all areas of technology are continually adding to the growing list of almost wholly conceptual elements in our economic output. These developments are affecting how we produce output and are demanding greater specialized knowledge. The use  for example  of computer-assisted design instruments  machine tools  and inventory control systems has given our former  more rigid factory assembly lines greater flexibility. Businesses now can more quickly customize their production to changes in market conditions; design cycles are shorter  quality control has been improved  and costs are lower. Offices are now routinely outfitted with high-speed information-processing technology. The accelerated pace of technological advance has also interacted with the rapid rise in financial innovation  with the result that business services and financial transactions now are transmitted almost instantaneously across global networks. Financial instruments have become increasingly diverse  the products more customized  and the markets more intensely competitive. Our nation’s financial institutions  in turn  are endeavoring to find more effective and efficient ways to deliver their services. In this environment  America’s prospects for economic growth will greatly depend on our capacity to develop and to apply new technology -- a quest that inevitably will entail some risk-taking. One lesson we have clearly learned is that we never can predict with any precision which particular technology or synergies of technologies will add significantly to our knowledge and ability to gain from that knowledge. Moreover  America’s ability to remain in the forefront of new ideas and products has become ever more difficult because of the rapid international diffusion of technology. Nonetheless  to date  we have not fallen behind in converting scientific and technological breakthroughs into viable commercial products. But  to be fully effective in realizing the gains from technological advance will require a considerable amount of human investment on the part of managers and workers who have to implement new processes and who must be prepared to adapt  over their lifetimes  to the ongoing change that innovations bring. Clearly our educational institutions will continue to play an important role in preparing workers. While we all are concerned about the performance of American elementary and secondary schools compared with those in other developed countries  there is little question about the quality of our university system  which for decades has attracted growing numbers of students from abroad. However  the notion that formal degree programs at any level can be crafted to fully support the requirements of one’s lifework is being challenged. A great deal of innovation and development has been occurring in the business sector where firms are striving to stay on the cutting edge  in an environment where products and knowledge rapidly become obsolete. Education  as a result  is increasingly becoming a lifelong activity; businesses are now looking for employees who are prepared to continue learning  and workers and managers in many kinds of pursuits had better look forward to persistent hard work acquiring and maintaining the skills needed to cope with a dynamically evolving economy. The recognition that more productive workers and learning go hand-in-hand is becoming ever more visible in both schools and in the workplace. Linkages between business and education should be encouraged at all levels of our education system. Your business school is an excellent example of how our educational institutions are building bridges to the private sector that will have payoffs in how well graduates are prepared to meet the challenges of an BIS Review 83/1997 - 3 - increasingly knowledge-based global economy. The growth of high-tech industry here in the Research Triangle  as well as in Silicon Valley and Boston -- all areas rich in educational and research institutions -- is no accident. In the private sector  a number of major corporations have invested in their own internal training centers -- so-called corporate universities. Some labor unions have done the same. More broadly  recent surveys by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that the provision of formal education on the job has risen markedly in recent years. By 1995  70 percent of workers in establishments with 50 or more employees had received some formal training during the twelve months preceding the survey. The incidence of training was relatively high across age groups and educational attainment. Most often this training was conducted in-house by company personnel  but larger firms also relied importantly on educational institutions. At the same time  we must be alert to the need to improve the skills and earning power of those who appear to be falling behind. In the long run  better child-rearing and better basic education at the elementary and secondary school level are essential to providing the foundation for a lifetime of learning. But in the shorter run  we must also develop strategies to overcome the education deficiencies of all too many of our young people  and to renew the skills of workers who have not kept up with the changing demands of the workplace. The advent of the twenty-first century will certainly not bring an end to the challenges we are facing in a rapidly changing world. Americans will surely adjust to a frenetic pace of change  as we have in the past  but we must recognize that adjustment is not automatic. All shifts in the structure of the economy naturally create frictions and human stress  at least temporarily. As those frictions dissipate  however  I have no doubt that the economy will emerge healthier. And  if we are able to boost our investment in people  ideas  and processes as well as machines  the economy can operate more effectively as it adapts to change. This holds the potential to create an even greater payoff of a broadly based rise in living standards over the longer run. Your new Kenan-Flagler facility will enhance this University’s ability to meet the challenge. BIS Review 83/1997

Introduction Good morning  and welcome to this briefing on the Reserve Bank’s September 1997 Economic Projections. You will recall that  in contrast to our June and December Monetary Policy Statements  which the Bank is obliged to produce by statute  the Economic Projections which we release each March and September are more in the nature of ‘self-initiated’ documents. Their primary purpose is to assist us in assessing economic developments that have a bearing on inflation trends  and thereby to assist us in forming judgements on how monetary policy should evolve. In publishing our Projections  we take the opportunity to inform financial markets and the public generally on what is driving our day-to-day policy decisions. Typically  you can expect to see in our Economic Projections more discussion of matters such as investment behaviour  labour market trends  the balance of payments and so on than is to be found in our Monetary Policy Statements  which concentrate more on assessments of past and future financial market conditions  and the stance of monetary policy. However  both documents require us to produce a comprehensive view of the future trends in the New Zealand economy  and to test our previously articulated views against the stream of emerging data and opinion. A key ingredient in that process is our new forecasting and policy system (FPS) -- the system of models we now utilise in developing our Projections. One important change which that new system of models has made possible was introduced with our June Monetary Policy Statement. Whereas we had previously projected inflation on the basis of an assumed track for interest rates and the exchange rate  in June we shifted to a structure that constrains our Projections of inflation to converge on the mid-part of the 0 to 3 percent inflation target  while allowing the track of monetary conditions to vary as necessary to produce that outcome. You can see that process at work again in these Projections . One point made in relation to FPS when it was first introduced bears repeating. While it is an important tool which helps shape our view of the economy and its likely future path  it is not a ‘black box’. FPS provides a coherent framework for thinking about the economy  but considerable judgement is still required to arrive at a final projection. There are clearly a number of different paths through which the economy can evolve to essentially the same point. What is portrayed in this document is just one of those paths  but one that we feel is both realistic and sound as a base for our policy judgements. The real economy Shortly after our June Monetary Policy Statement was published  the release of March quarter GDP data seemed to suggest that the economy was significantly weaker than we had allowed for. Our subsequent analysis indicated that there were particular factors (notably that Easter  unusually  fell into the March quarter) which explained much of the small decline in GDP in that quarter. BIS Review 84/1997 - 2 - Since then  the emerging data have suggested that the economy is a little weaker than we had portrayed in June  but that it is also resuming a robust growth path. Whereas we were projecting an annualised growth rate through the first half of calendar 1997 of a little over 1 percent  the estimate incorporated in these Projections is closer to 0.5 percent. Having said that  data released since we completed the Projections are  if anything  suggestive of stronger rather than weaker outcomes for June quarter GDP. In any event  we remain of the view expressed in June that activity will pick up in the second half of the year. Over the year to March 1998  we expect the economy to expand by around 2.5 percent  accelerating further to 4.6 percent growth in the year to March 1999. The factors driving that expansion include a robust global economy  gradually increasing household expenditures  improved productivity  stronger exports (partly the result of a lower exchange rate)  business investment and an expansionary fiscal policy -- both from increased government spending under the Coalition Agreement and from the tax cuts scheduled for July 1998. Easier monetary conditions since earlier this year are also supportive of stronger growth. It seems clear that  in the middle of this decade  the New Zealand economy became somewhat over-stretched in terms of its ability to support the pace of spending. It seems equally clear that the economy has entered a period in which there is some spare capacity. Given the current and imminent expansionary forces that I have described  the spare-capacity phase should be short-lived  but long enough to take the pressure off inflation  and long enough to make it unlikely that we will experience the kind of destructive crunch that has so often brought past cycles to a shuddering halt. In this sense  we are describing a growth profile that reflects the steadying influence of maintaining low inflation  which in turn should contribute to New Zealand’s future growth potential. We expect continued job creation throughout the period to March 2000  continued growth in real disposable household income (averaging over 3 percent per annum through the projection period)  continuing modest fiscal surpluses  further declines in the government’s debt-to-GDP ratio  and an improvement in the current account deficit from nearly 6 percent of GDP to around 4 percent of GDP. Inflation As I mentioned earlier  our new Projections framework takes as given that inflation should converge on the mid-part of our target range  and derives the monetary conditions that are needed to achieve that outcome. In that sense there is no particular news in the fact that we expect underlying inflation to be close to the middle of the target over the projection period. But there are some aspects of the inflation track that require comment. In particular  we now expect inflation outcomes over the next two quarters to be rather higher than was the case in June. There are two principal sources of that upward revision. First  the last few months have seen a 6 or 7 percent depreciation of the trade-weighted exchange rate. The increased inflation now expected over the next two quarters is  in part  a direct consequence of that depreciation. Secondly  domestic inflation continues to be strongly influenced by the policy decisions of the Government. We now estimate that  over the next two quarters  policy-related increases in Housing New Zealand rentals and tertiary education fees could well exceed the BIS Review 84/1997 - 3 - materiality threshold which is applied in determining our measure of underlying inflation. In that event  underlying inflation would be slightly lower than the estimates given in these Projections. Policy Implications We now view an MCI level of 725 as being appropriate for the next quarter. This is 100 basis points lower than the desired MCI level which has applied for the last quarter  but roughly equivalent to actual monetary conditions over recent weeks. You will recall that a 100 point reduction in the MCI is equivalent to a 1 percentage point decline in 90 day bill rates  a 2 percent decline in the TWI  or some equivalent combination. You may also recall that the average MCI for the December 1996 quarter was 1000. The extent of easing over the past nine months has clearly been significant  although certainly off a high base. Our Projections point to further  but quite small  easings in the first two quarters of 1998 before emerging inflationary pressures lead us to expect monetary conditions to enter another tightening phase. However  as we make clear in our policy assessment section  whether those further easings eventuate in 1998 is very much dependent on how the economy develops over the next few months. Financial market participants eager to bring forward the small  and conditional  easings shown in these Projections clearly do so at their own risk! On the face of it  with inflation over the next two years  and especially over the next two quarters  being a little higher than we thought likely back in June  easing now by more than we foreshadowed in June may seem surprising. The explanation is straightforward  and relates to the lags inherent in the operation of monetary policy. While inflation is a little higher in the short term than we had previously expected  it is still well within our target range  and has been boosted by factors which should be essentially transitory  such as the impact of moving Housing NZ rentals to market. Of more relevance to the outlook in 18 months to two years’ time is the margin of spare capacity in the economy. That now looks somewhat larger than it did previously  and warrants somewhat easier monetary conditions. Although activity will be accelerating through 1998  it is not until 1999 that the inflation pressures associated with strong growth begin to emerge. A gradual tightening of monetary conditions from mid-1998 fits with that profile. There are  of course  alternative paths for monetary policy that could deliver inflation within our target range. As was discussed in June  one alternative path would involve more aggressive easing now  followed by earlier and more aggressive tightening next year. Another path would involve holding conditions relatively flat at about current levels until the latter part of 1998 before beginning a somewhat gentler tightening beyond that date. Inevitably  there is rather more art than science in selecting the best of these alternatives. What we have chosen reflects the risks that we see around us at present  and also reflects the benefits we see in providing a relatively smooth path for monetary conditions over time. The mix of monetary conditions On numerous occasions over the past year or two  I have indicated that the particular mix of monetary conditions was unhelpful -- that the exchange rate was too high  putting excessive pressure on exporters  and that interest rates remained too low to discourage borrowing for housing purposes  or to encourage increased domestic savings. The past quarter has seen a substantial  and welcome  shift in the mix of monetary conditions in the direction we believed appropriate. The fall in the exchange rate will boost the incomes of exporters and those competing with imports  and will ultimately increase export volumes. The projected improvement in the current account balance reflects that. The increase in BIS Review 84/1997 - 4 - interest rates is also helpful  given the continuing pressures we have seen in the domestic or non-tradeables sector of the economy  and especially in real estate markets. There is no benefit to New Zealand in seeing real estate prices increase to a point where they become vulnerable to a sudden  and damaging  correction. (Anyone who has been observing events in South-East Asia over the past couple of months will be conscious of the enormous damage that can be inflicted in those circumstances. Our own experience post-1987 is also instructive in that regard.) The shift in the mix of conditions  while substantial  has occurred in a manner which is fully consistent with our inflation target  and fully consistent with our use of an MCI in assessing the overall stance of monetary policy. It is certainly the case that the sharp decline of the exchange rate will boost inflation to some degree in the short term. That is already apparent in our Projections. But even with that increase  projected inflation remains well within our target range. And the increase in interest rates that has accompanied the exchange rate fall will work in the opposite direction  dampening inflation in the longer-term. The MCI At the time when the exchange rate was declining  and interest rates were rising  we heard a good deal of criticism of our MCI. It was  it was claimed  too rigid; it was forcing up interest rates at a time when the economy was already in recession; it was based on a relationship between interest rates and the exchange rate which was no longer valid; and so on. As I made clear in my speech to the Counties Kiwifruit Growers Association on 22 August  I regard those criticisms as ill-founded. I think the MCI structure has performed admirably over the past three months. In making that assessment  I think it is important to reflect on just how volatile international exchange rates have been over that period. Any of the alternative monetary policy arrangements we could have adopted in place of the MCI would also have been subject to a good deal of stress. I certainly see no reason to change the MCI approach at this point. Likewise  the description I offered in June of how the Bank might react to deviations in actual market conditions from the central or ‘desired’ MCI track appears to us to have weathered the tests of the past quarter rather well. I see no reason to modify that description now  and our response to evolving market conditions over the next three months will be consistent with my comments of June. BIS Review 84/1997

It has been a little over two years since my last public speech to an audience in the United States. During this time  a lot has happened in terms of economic developments in our two countries. One thing that continues to impress me is the remarkable performance of the U.S. economy  which has achieved six years of steady economic expansion  with high rates of job creation and low inflation. As a neighbour and major trading partner  Canada has certainly benefited from the strong U.S. economy. But I think that what is happening in the United States is relevant to Canada in other ways. First  it offers a yardstick that we Canadians often use to judge the performance of our own economy. Second  as the unused capacity in the Canadian economy is gradually absorbed  monetary policy in Canada will be facing challenges similar to those that the Federal Reserve has had to confront in trying to steer the U.S. economy on a path of durable  non-inflationary expansion. The recent U.S. experience in this area is  therefore  particularly interesting for us. Today  I would like to discuss the recent economic record in Canada and the challenges ahead for monetary policy. In doing so  I will emphasize the Bank of Canada’s continued commitment to explicit targets for keeping inflation low. Along with their other benefits  these targets help anchor market expectations about future movements in the exchange rate. The role of the exchange rate in the operation of Canadian monetary policy is another topic I will discuss today. The recent economic record in Canada Let us first take a quick look at how the Canadian economy has performed in the recent past  in comparative terms. In terms of economic growth and job creation  there is no doubt that Canada has not done as well as the United States in the 1990s. And even though  in my view  there are good explanations for this  the fact remains that Canada has some catching up to do in this regard. Why has the growth in output and employment been more modest in Canada than in the United States in recent years? I believe that the reasons lie in the major transformation that the Canadian economy has been going through since the beginning of this decade. This transformation has been in response both to the universal forces of globalization and technological change  and to the need to unwind the domestic excesses and imbalances that had built up in the 1970s and the 1980s. Let me remind you that  through that period  high actual and expected inflation had led to escalating production costs  speculative activity  and the accumulation of debt by households  by businesses  and by Canadian governments. Our foreign indebtedness was also rising rapidly  as BIS Review 84/1997 - 2 - were the risk premiums in our interest rates  leaving us in a very vulnerable position indeed. By the late 1980s  the situation had become untenable. Canada had to adjust. Of course  the United States also had to cope with many of these changes. Why has the restructuring been more intense and disruptive in Canada? In my view  the most important reasons are that the distortions arising from high inflation were more severe in Canada and that the adjustments to globalization and technological change were slow in coming. As a result  Canada had to do more and do it faster. The short-run disruptions associated with the economic restructuring have been significant. Plant closings  cutbacks in major government programs  and layoffs in both the private and public sectors caused a great deal of uncertainty among Canadian households. And it did not help that interest rates rose sharply in 1994 and early 1995 as investor nervousness about Canada’s fiscal and political situation increased in the wake of turbulence in global financial markets. All of this left Canadians anxious about the future and cautious about spending  which acted as a drag on output and employment. But there have also been some particularly encouraging results from the restructuring. Canada has made rather dramatic economic adjustments in recent years  and as a result has emerged with a much sounder economic foundation. Inflation has averaged just under 2 per cent during the past five and a half years -- well below that in the United States. With the benefit of low inflation and low interest rates  Canadian businesses have been investing in new technology and streamlining their operations to become more efficient  productive  and internationally competitive. Canadian governments have taken steps to reduce their deficits and to move towards less vulnerable debt positions. And  with our success in exporting and these improved fiscal positions  the persistent large shortfall in the current account of our international balance of payments has narrowed markedly. These improvements in Canada’s economic fundamentals have not been lost on financial markets. They are the reason why risk premiums demanded by investors on Canadian dollar assets have declined sharply over the past two years. They are also the reason why the markets today see a potential for upward movement in the Canadian dollar over time  thus allowing interest rates on maturities up to 30 years to remain below comparable U.S. rates. This is a view of the Canadian dollar that we at the Bank of Canada share. These low Canadian interest rates represent a substantial stimulus to domestic spending. Because of the lags involved  it has taken households and businesses some time to respond. But now we have strong evidence  particularly from the interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy  that the consumer is back. And businesses continue to increase their capital spending. Moreover  the latest surveys of consumer and business confidence point to continued expansion in domestic spending in coming months. What is particularly heartening is that total employment growth has picked up recently  despite the cutbacks in the public sector  and that the number of full-time jobs has increased significantly. Altogether  it seems to me that the Canadian economy has the potential for a long period of sustained growth in output and employment  with rising productivity and improving living standards. The challenge ahead What does monetary policy need to do to help realize this potential? BIS Review 84/1997 - 3 - With the economy gathering momentum  the challenge for monetary policy in the period ahead will be to encourage monetary conditions that preserve Canada’s good inflation performance  because low inflation is a prerequisite for a durable economic expansion. Experience has taught us that monetary stimulus which pushes too hard on the economy’s capacity limits for too long inevitably leads to rising inflation and painful boom and bust economic cycles of the kind we suffered in Canada from the 1970s to the early 1990s. Concern about inflation risks at this stage may seem misplaced. But monetary policy actions have their full effects on the economy with relatively long lags. So what we must be concerned with is not the current rate of inflation but rather what may happen in 1998 and beyond. To maintain a low and stable rate of inflation in the period ahead  we must conduct monetary policy in a forward-looking  pre-emptive manner. This means that we should be ready to take action early to ensure that  as slack is absorbed  the pace of economic activity converges smoothly with the path implied by potential output -- that is  the economy’s capacity to produce on a sustained basis. It is our view that the Canadian economy should indeed absorb the existing unused capacity over the course of the next couple of years. Thus  there will be a need to move to less-stimulative monetary conditions in the period ahead. Taking timely  measured steps in that direction is the recipe for avoiding the more substantial  and potentially more disruptive  tightening that would be required later if monetary policy actions were unduly delayed. As the Canadian economy approaches full capacity  we will have to contend with the considerable uncertainty that surrounds the estimation of potential output. The recent experience in the United States  where despite a high level of resource utilization there has been no sign yet of generalized inflationary pressures  raises the possibility that past relationships have been altered by structural changes at both the national and international levels. It is possible that technological innovations have increased the flexibility and efficiency of production processes. Heightened global competition and low inflation worldwide may have led to a reduction of inflation expectations and to a change in price- and wage-setting behaviour. Monetary policy must somehow find a way to take all of these factors into consideration in order to avoid systematic misjudgements on potential output and the risk of inflation. I believe that Canada’s inflation-control target provides a useful framework within which to do that. Let me explain. Our target  set jointly with the Government of Canada  calls for inflation to be held within a range of 1 to 3 per cent. One attraction of an explicit inflation-control target is that it allows a ready assessment of macroeconomic performance by looking at the trend of the inflation rate relative to the target range. If it looks as though the trend of inflation will push through the top of the target range  this implies that demand in the economy has been unsustainably strong. Conversely  if it appears that the trend of inflation is about to fall through the bottom of the range  this suggests weak demand and a persistent margin of unused capacity. Moreover  if we somehow continually misjudge the economy’s capacity to produce  we will in all likelihood witness an unexpected trend in the inflation rate. For example  if the rate is persistently lower than would have been expected in the past at the current levels of aggregate demand  and it is tending to press the bottom of the target range  chances are that the BIS Review 84/1997 - 4 - economy has more room to absorb higher levels of demand than previously thought. Thus  the targets provide a check on systematic errors in estimating potential output. However  if monetary policy is going to take account of such signals  the central bank had better make sure that its inflation-control strategy is a credible one. Why? Because only if it is widely accepted that the central bank will keep inflation under control  will businesses and individuals not respond immediately to signs of strong demand pressures by seeking to raise prices and wages. The recent U.S. experience attests to this. Indeed  strong credibility has been a key factor that has enabled the Fed to take account of the possible changes in economic structure that I mentioned earlier and to steer the U.S. economy successfully towards levels of aggregate demand and employment that in the past would have been thought incompatible with maintaining low inflation. It is by conducting monetary policy prudently during the economic upswing that we at the Bank of Canada will have the credibility needed when our economy begins to operate at levels that test its potential to produce. The role of the exchange rate I would now like to take a moment to underscore the important role that the exchange rate plays in the conduct of Canadian monetary policy and to explain what I meant earlier when I used the term “monetary conditions”. In a medium-sized  open economy  like Canada’s  a good deal of the impact of monetary policy actions is channelled through the exchange rate. But because financial markets do not always respond to events in completely predictable ways  we do not know exactly how interest rates and the exchange rate will move and interact. That is why we at the Bank have found it useful to construct an index of monetary conditions to help us keep track of the combined effect of these two variables on aggregate demand in Canada. To understand how we use monetary conditions in practice  let us look at the recent situation where cyclical differences have meant that the Canadian economy has been weaker than the U.S. economy. In these circumstances  the need for accommodative monetary conditions in Canada required the Bank of Canada to take action to lower interest rates. But the magnitude and timing of those interest rate reductions depended  to an important degree  on the exchange rate response. With the Canadian dollar roughly stable between late 1995 and late 1996  the easing in monetary conditions could take place through measured declines in interest rates. The strengthening Canadian dollar through the latter part of 1996 accelerated the decline in interest rates  as the Bank of Canada sought to maintain the degree of monetary ease achieved in the autumn of 1996. With the economy gathering momentum since then  persistent weakness in the Canadian dollar through June 1997 prompted a small increase in interest rates in order to offset an undesired further easing in monetary conditions. I might add that  since cyclical differences have required interest rates in Canada to be below those in the United States  there has been -- rightly -- a strong market perception that the relative weakness of the Canadian dollar is temporary and that a future appreciation will compensate investors for the lower yields on Canadian dollar assets. But experience has taught us that this process of exchange rate/interest rate interaction works well only if there are no concerns in the markets about Canadian economic policies. As we found out in 1994-95  when there were concerns about fiscal policy  a decline in the value of the Canadian dollar can BIS Review 84/1997 - 5 - generate a loss of confidence and expectations of further depreciation of the currency  not of subsequent appreciation. The upshot of all this is that  with a floating currency  market participants need a consistent and credible policy framework to help anchor their expectations about future movements in the exchange rate. Such a framework rests  above all  on a firm undertaking by the authorities to preserve the domestic purchasing value of the currency. I believe that our inflation-control targets  by giving a clear  precise view of this commitment  provide a strong underpinning for the external value of the Canadian dollar. What is my main message to you today? Canada is in better shape now than it has been for many years to face the economic challenges of the future and to reap the benefits of changing technology and an increasingly integrated world economy. But  for this scenario to unfold  there will have to be continued commitment by the authorities to prudent  credible economic policies. As far as monetary policy goes  this means a pledge to maintain Canada’s good inflation performance. That is a pledge I can give without reservation. BIS Review 84/1997

Meyer  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  before the 1998 Global Economic and Investment Outlook Conference  Carnegie Mellon University  Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania on 17/9/97.,Mr. Meyer considers the economic outlook and challenges facing monetary policy Remarks by Mr. Laurence H. Meyer  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  before the 1998 Global Economic and Investment Outlook Conference  Carnegie Mellon University  Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania on 17/9/97. Recent economic performance has been hailed on Wall Street as “paradise found” and the “best of times.” And  on Main Street  there is ample survey evidence suggesting that consumers are feeling very upbeat about the prospects for the economy. I call the remarkable combination of healthy growth  low unemployment  low inflation  a soaring stock market  and declining federal budget deficit the “good news” economy. But there are challenges even in the “good news” economy and I want to focus on three of them this afternoon. The first challenge is to avoid complacency and appreciate the policy challenges that remain. The second is to explain how we have been able to achieve such favorable performance  given that it is better than almost anyone predicted and better than historical regularities suggested was even possible. And the third challenge is to assess the risks in the current environment and determine how monetary policy should be positioned to keep the good news coming. Two themes will become evident as I address these challenges. First  there are limits -- limits on what policy can accomplish and limits on what the economy can achieve. Second  in assessing the current environment and its implications for monetary policy  uncertainties require us to balance historical regularities and newer possibilities. Expansions  to an important degree  have common properties  what I shall refer to as regularities. Both forecasters and policymakers rely on these. Forecasters make predictions about future developments based on regularities. The same regularities allow policymakers to act pre-emptively -- changing policy today in anticipation of developments tomorrow. Yet each expansion has its own signature that reflects the specific set of transitory influences and longer-lasting structural changes in play at the time. The current episode features the following players. Cyclical regularities clearly in evidence include accelerator effects  changing tolerances for risk  and cyclical swings in the unemployment rate and in profits. Two other regularities that I especially want to focus on today are the Phillips Curve and the trend growth in output. The latter regularities define limits - limits to the sustainable level of output  at any moment  and  once that level of capacity is reached  to the growth of output over time. If these limits are exceeded  as typically happens during a cyclical expansion  the economy eventually overheats  inflation increases  and the expansion is undermined as policy is forced to rein in demand. Transitory influences  clearly among the stars of the current episode  feature a coincidence of favorable supply shocks that have restrained inflation. Finally  structural adjustments  in this episode  hint at a decline in NAIRU and/or an increase in trend growth. The central question in interpreting the recent experience is whether the old limits on economic performance are no longer binding  having been replaced by new possibilities  or are just being temporarily overruled by transitory influences. Before moving to the substance of my talk  let me remind you that my remarks on the outlook and monetary policy  today and always  are my views. I do not speak for the FOMC. Near-Term prospects in the Good News Economy Before addressing the challenges and developing these themes  let me briefly review the surprisingly favorable features of recent economic performance and comment on the near-term outlook. For this audience  I can summarize recent performance in a single sentence. We have been recently blessed with relatively strong cyclical growth  the lowest unemployment rate in 24 years  the lowest BIS Review 85/1997 - 2 - inflation in 31 years  an impressive investment boom  soaring equity prices and a 5-year decline in the federal budget deficit that may take the deficit to below ½% of GDP in fiscal 1997. But this conference is about the next chapter in this story. And the key in the near term may be crosscurrents that appear likely to both moderate output growth and keep inflation relatively well contained. In the case of output growth  the crosscurrents are the continued strength in demand and the expected slowing in inventory investment. In the second quarter  the economy slowed to an upward revised 3.6% rate  from a 4.9% rate in the first quarter  a much more modest slowing than originally reported and widely anticipated during the quarter. This  by the way  has been a recurring pattern in the expansion -- every time I thought the economy had or was about to slow to trend  it has surprised with its continued strength. The fundamentals continue to look very positive. In particular  households as a group are wealthy and optimistic  businesses are profitable and confronted with dramatic technological opportunities  and financial conditions remain supportive. There appear to be few imbalances that are a threat to continued expansion. As a result  demand is expected to remain strong in the second half of the year  paced by a rebound in consumer spending and complemented by continued strength in business fixed investment. Forecasters know  however  that the composition or mix of output in one quarter -- specifically the mix between final demand and inventory investment -- often provides an important hint of what is to come. While I interpret the strength of inventory investment in the first half -- including the upward revised rate of about $78 billion in the second quarter -- as largely voluntary  principally reflecting a response to the strength in past and prospective sales  the flow rate of accumulation in the second quarter is almost certainly unsustainable. That is  stocks may be in equilibrium  but the flow rate will have to slow to keep them there. The resulting slowdown in inventory investment is likely  therefore  to be a significant drag on production in the second half of this year  offsetting  at least in part  the expected rebound in final demand. On the inflation side  there are also important crosscurrents at work. I have been concerned about two considerations that suggest that inflation may well rise over time: the possibility that the economy is operating today beyond its sustainable capacity and the likelihood that the transitory factors that have  on balance  been restraining inflation will diminish in importance over time. However  three other influences that  in my view  have gradually become more significant considerations  are likely to moderate the tendency for inflation to rise in the near term. First  lower-than-expected overall and core inflation and continued modest pace of wage change over this year will encourage more restrained increases in wages and prices over the coming year. Lower inflation leads to lower inflation expectations  reinforcing the prospect for low inflation ahead. In this case  inertia is our friend and the result is a virtuous wage-price spiral  at least for a while. Second  some of the transitory factors  especially the appreciation of the dollar and resulting decline in import prices  appear to have longer legs and are likely to contribute more toward restraint on inflation in coming quarters than earlier appeared likely. Third  the upward adjustment to profits in the July NIPA revisions suggests there is more of a profit cushion that could delay the pass-through of higher compensation to price increases. While these crosscurrents suggest moderation in both output growth and inflation  crosscurrents don’t necessarily balance. With respect to output growth  the crosscurrents do point toward slower growth in the second half compared to the first half  but is important whether the slower growth turns out to be near trend  holding utilization rates constant  or above trend  pushing utilization rates still higher. At the very least  the slowdown in inventory investment is likely to be accommodated with minimal disturbance to the continued expansion. But there is a risk that growth will continue to be above trend  pushing utilization rates up  from already high levels. BIS Review 85/1997 - 3 - With respect to inflation  the netting of the crosscurrents suggests a modest increase in inflation in 1998  albeit from a steadily downward-revised and very low rate in 1997. I will pay very close attention to the source of any rebound in inflation  specifically the degree to which it reflects simply the dissipation of some of the favorable supply shocks that have contributed to the very low inflation this year and the degree to which it reflects the more persistent effect of high utilization rates. As a result  I will be focusing more on core than overall inflation rates and paying particularly close attention to labor costs  given that labor markets appear tighter than product markets and therefore more likely to be the source of any increase in inflation pressures. Still  any increase in inflation would begin from a lower base and may be more modest than previously appeared likely. The bottom line is that past performance  in several important dimensions  has been extraordinary and that prospects look favorable for continued expansion and relatively low inflation. Still  monetary policy must be alert to the potential of a developing upward trend in inflation in an economy that may already be operating beyond its sustainable capacity and possibly still growing at an above-trend rate. And  as always  there are challenges  even in the good news economy. Limits on What Monetary Policy Can Do The first challenge is to avoid becoming complacent. Even as there are good reasons for celebrating recent economic performance  there are good reasons for avoiding complacency. Specifically  there are dimensions of economic performance which are less stellar  such as the slow average growth rate in GDP in the 1990s  a continuation of the effects of the productivity slowdown that began in the early 1970s. There are  in addition  obvious longer-run problems that deserve to be confronted today  such as those related to the aging of the population and resulting pressures on entitlement programs. And there remain lingering social strains associated with a gradual increase in income inequality  interacting with the low average growth rate in productivity to produce a long period of relatively stagnant real income for the median income family. This less rosy perspective on the current state of the economy was suggested by several members of Congress during the recent oversight hearings on monetary policy. I think the point is an important one and I agree that we should not let the recent favorable performance of inflation  unemployment and equity prices distract our attention from the importance of confronting a slow average rate of increase in living standards and lingering social problems that both reflect and are exacerbated by a widening in income inequality. However  other than through its pursuit of its legislative mandates of price stability and maximum sustainable employment  monetary policy cannot make a major contribution to the resolution of these problems. Monetary policy  in particular cannot remedy increases in income inequality  raise the trend rate of increase in living standards  or combat inadequate opportunities for upward mobility out of poverty. It is  as always  important that we carry out our traditional responsibilities well  accommodating the maximum sustainable growth and achieving the maximum sustainable level of employment. But we cannot do more. Regularities The second challenge is to explain why performance has been so favorable  at least in terms of inflation and unemployment. Before exploring explanations of the puzzle  I want to focus on common features of cyclical expansions. In doing so  I will focus on cyclical expansions that have not been dominated by dramatic external shocks  such as the two episodes that were marked by steeply rising world oil prices -- first in the early 1970s and again in the late 1970s and early 1980s. While even these expansions share many of the patterns I emphasize later  their endings are dominated by the effects of the powerful supply shocks and policy responses to the shocks. Expansions  by definition  begin with considerable economic slack  inherited from the previous recession. The economy typically makes a rapid transition from declining output (the definition of recession) to above-trend growth. In a loose way  trend growth refers to the growth in the economy’s productive capacity. When growth is above trend  production is expanding faster than the economy’s BIS Review 85/1997 - 4 - productive capacity and  as a result  resource utilization rates rise. Rising capacity utilization rates and falling unemployment rates are thus a typical feature of an expansion period. The natural dynamic of an expansion is for above-trend growth to continue until demand overtakes capacity  despite the best efforts of policy to avoid cyclical excesses. The end of the story is particularly important. Expansions do not die of old age or lethargy  a spontaneous weakening of aggregate demand  but rather of an accumulation of imbalances  specifically with demand outstripping the limits of sustainable level of input utilization and growth of output. The resulting rise in inflation becomes a threat to the continued expansion. Preventive medicine is therefore the best course of treatment. In this story  NAIRU sets a limit to how far the economy can expand before overheating sets in and inflation rises  and the Phillips Curve traces out an important part of the dynamics of inflation  how fast it responds to excess demand. Of course  the Phillips Curve framework has always been much easier to describe than to implement  given uncertainties about the estimates of NAIRU  given the fact that empirical regularities between inflation and unemployment always left much of the variation in inflation unexplained  and given the importance of supply shocks with significant  though transitory  effects on the inflation-unemployment nexus. Nevertheless  the regularity in the cyclical sensitivity of inflation  as embedded in the Phillips Curve  has proved to be an important guide to both forecasters and monetary policymakers in the past. Transitory Influences The consensus estimates of NAIRU as this expansion began -- about 6% -- did not prepare us for the recent surprisingly favorable performance. It is possible that the Phillips Curve and NAIRU is simply the wrong analytical framework  but I doubt it and am not aware of another model of inflation dynamics that is ready to take its place. So my response is to update my estimate of NAIRU and add other explanations consistent with this framework  but not to abandon this concept. One possible explanation is that one or more transitory factors  for the moment  are yielding a more favorable than usual outcome. A coincidence of favorable supply shocks is clearly  in my judgment  an important part of the answer to the puzzle. I won’t talk at length about these factors  as I have done so in previous talks. I would just note that these favorable supply shocks include an appreciation of the dollar and consequent decline in import prices; a slowing in the rate of increase in benefit costs  concentrated in a slowdown in costs for health care insurance; a faster rate of decline in computer prices than earlier  reflecting the quicker pace of innovation; and more recently  a decline in oil prices and a slower rate of increase in food prices. A Cyclical Anomaly Let me include in my list of explanations for the current favorable economic performance an intriguing cyclical anomaly. One regularity of past expansions has been the close relationship between two widely used measures of resource utilization -- the capacity utilization and unemployment rates. They have traditionally moved together over a cycle and tended to mirror one another. In this case  it did not matter which one was used as a proxy for excess demand; and the unemployment rate could be used interchangeably as a measure of labor market demand pressures and overall economy-wide demand pressures. In the current episode  however  these two measures are sending different signals. The unemployment rate is flashing a warning of a very tight labor market. The capacity utilization rate  in contrast  suggests a reasonably balanced configuration of production and capacity in the product market  at least in the manufacturing sector. Why has this divergence developed and what are its implications for the relationship between inflation and unemployment? The divergence mirrors one of the other defining features of this expansion -- the boom in business fixed investment. The result is a high level of net investment  a more rapid rate of increase in the capital stock and hence in industrial capacity. BIS Review 85/1997 - 5 - The resulting absence of excess demand in the product market is  in my view  an important factor explaining the frequently reported absence of pricing leverage by firms. Nothing gives a firm pricing leverage like excess demand. In addition  the resulting inability of firms to pass on higher costs in higher prices likely has altered the way firms operate in the labor market  making them more reluctant to bid aggressively for workers  contributing to a slower rate of increase in wages than we would otherwise have expected at prevailing labor utilization rates. It is possible that the gap that has opened between the unemployment and capacity utilization rates may be a factor that has  in effect  lowered NAIRU in this expansion. This explanation has potential  but there is no historical precedent and it is  therefore  difficult to judge its importance. Possibilities The most intriguing explanations for the recent favorable performance are structural changes  which may have relaxed the capacity constraints that are the core of the cyclical regularities story  or made these constraints more flexible than in the past  or tempered the ability and/or willingness of firms to respond to excess demand by raising wages and prices. I refer to these collectively as “possibilities ” as they suggest an optimistic period of improved economic performance  contrasting with both the pessimism of the previously perceived limits in the cyclical regularities story or the grudging “for the moment” concession of explanations relying on transitory influences. There are two possibilities that have been widely discussed: that the economy can now sustain a lower unemployment rate without rising inflation (i.e.  that NAIRU has declined) and that  once capacity has been reached  the economy is now capable of faster growth  compared to the estimates of trend growth reported earlier. A lot of the discussion about this episode focuses on sorting out the relative importance of the two possibilities -- specifically  whether the recent favorable performance is due more to labor market structural change  as reflected in a lower NAIRU  or to product market structural change  as reflected in a higher rate of growth in productivity. Has there been a decline in NAIRU? Time varying parameter estimates of the Phillips Curve and the more casual eye both suggest a decline in NAIRU. Robert Gordon’s work  for example  suggests a decline in NAIRU  from 6% in the decade prior to 1994  to about 5½% by the end of 1995  with NAIRU stabilizing at this level since that time. One possible explanation for the more moderate rate of increase in compensation per hour than would have been expected from historical experience is an increase in worker insecurity as a consequence of the rapid pace of technological change and/or the rapid pace of restructuring and downsizing. As a result  workers may have been willing to trade off some real wages for increased security  resulting in a more modest increase in compensation per hour than otherwise would have been expected. The result is a slower rate of increase in compensation at any given level of unemployment  equivalent to a decline in NAIRU. Another possible explanation is the divergence between the unemployment and capacity utilization rates in this expansion that I discussed earlier. Although a decline in NAIRU is a story of relaxed limits  the worker insecurity explanation is not itself an optimistic story. Some workers  to be sure  gain  by opportunities for employment that otherwise would have been denied. But a broader group of workers suffer a slower increase in living standards  relative to what otherwise would have been “possible.” Has there been an increase in trend productivity? Another possibility is that the trend rate of increase in productivity -- and hence the economy’s sustainable rate of growth in GDP -- has recently increased. There is some confusion in many discussions of productivity growth about the implications of measurement bias. It is widely accepted that there is a downward bias in measured BIS Review 85/1997 - 6 - productivity growth  the mirror image of the upward bias in measured inflation. But it is also widely accepted that a similar bias has been present over the entire postwar period. The measurement issue is relevant to explaining the inflation-unemployment experience in the current episode only if the bias has recently become more serious. An increase in measurement bias could be under way  perhaps related to an acceleration in technical change  but it will be a long time before we are able to establish this with a reasonable degree of certainty. Note also that if the measurement bias has increased  this would imply that both actual and potential output growth are higher than reported  with no obvious implication for the gap between actual and potential output  and hence for inflation pressures. Sources of higher productivity growth  all of which should show up in measured productivity  include a return on years of corporate restructuring and the increase in capital per worker associated with the current investment boom  much of which is linked to technological change  specifically the information revolution. There are a couple of reasons why this is an attractive explanation. No other explanation has the ability to explain as many features of the current experience as an increase in trend productivity. Technological change  according to this view  has resulted in new profit opportunities which in turn have resulted in an investment boom (heavily concentrated in high technology equipment)  increased corporate earnings  and a soaring stock market. In addition  this explanation is consistent with many anecdotes from businesses about efficiency gains as new technology is put into place. There are  however  some problems with this story as the principal explanation for the favorable inflation performance. First  a productivity explanation would resonate better if the puzzle were why higher wage change was not being passed on in higher prices. But the greater puzzle is the slow pace of increase in compensation per hour at prevailing unemployment rates. This is more clearly the case after the downward revision in compensation in the July NIPA revisions  bringing that measure of compensation per hour more in line with the Employment Cost Index. Given the rate of increase in compensation  an unchanged trend growth in productivity of 1.1%  for example  seems quite consistent with recent price performance. Although not without some serious shortcomings  the published productivity data provide little encouragement to the view that there has been a significant improvement in underlying productivity growth. The growth in measured productivity over this expansion has  in fact  been disappointing. Over 1994 and 1995  in particular  measured productivity was nearly flat. Although it has accelerated over the last two years  this is consistent with another cyclical regularity  the tendency for productivity to accelerate with economic activity. And the rate of growth over the last year  even with the sharp upward revision in the second quarter  is 1.2%  just above the 1.1% average rate of increase over the period from the early 1970s up to the beginning of this expansion. Still  there are other pieces of data and interpretations of the published data that provide some support to a more optimistic assessment. For example  the acceleration in productivity to a 1.2% rate over the last year  at a time when the unemployment rate was dropping to a level that would suggest less productive workers were being drawn on  leaves open the possibility that the productivity trend has quickened. Perhaps the strongest case for an increase in the productivity trend comes from the higher rate of growth over the past two years if productivity is measured from the income side of the national accounts. Balancing regularities and possibilities In my testimony at the Congressional oversight hearings  I presented a range of estimates for NAIRU and trend growth from the CBO  Council of Economic Advisers  DRI  Macroeconomic Advisers and Professor Robert Gordon. The range for NAIRU was 5.4% to 5.9% and for trend growth  2.1%-2.3%. Since my testimony  both DRI and Macroeconomic Advisers have revised down their estimates of NAIRU-DRI from 5.8% to 5.6% and Macroeconomic Advisers from 5.8% to 5.4%. The range of estimates is now therefore more tightly concentrated around 5½%. I presented these estimates in BIS Review 85/1997 - 7 - my testimony to emphasize the continuing importance the profession attaches to NAIRU  the central tendency of current NAIRU estimates  and the absence of significant upward adjustments to estimates of trend growth. In short  some updating in the regularities may be appropriate  especially in the case of NAIRU  but continued attention to their message of limits remains critical for disciplined policy. We should remain open minded and alert to the possibility of structural change  but cautious about reaching the conclusion that the regularities that have been so important in the past no longer set limits that policy must respect. The challenge for monetary policy Some day we shall look back on this episode with historical perspective and perhaps -- and only perhaps -- have a better ability to sort out what contributed to the favorable outcome and the extent to which the prevailing coexistence of low unemployment and stable low inflation proved permanent or transitory. Monetary policy  however  is made in real time. The appropriate stance of monetary policy should reflect both the increased uncertainty surrounding the failure of historical regularities to predict the better-than-expected outcome in terms of inflation and unemployment and the best judgement about regularities as we update our estimates of NAIRU and trend growth in response to current data. At one extreme  the uncertainty about the source of the recent performance might be viewed as so great that the best course for monetary policy is a reactive posture  waiting for clear signs that inflation is rising and only tightening in response to such evidence. I agree that the current uncertainty encourages caution  but not to the point of paralysis. A prudent approach would continue to lean against the cyclical winds by adjusting policy in response to persistent increases in utilization rates as well as in response to changes in underlying inflation. Summing Up We should always have problems like today’s  struggling to explain unexpectedly good performance. And it is important to keep in perspective any questions about how tight labor markets might be or whether near-term growth might remain above trend. The economy is very healthy and the prospects continue to be bright. But as we celebrate the exceptional present  we should not forget the lessons of the past. There are limits. They may not be the old limits that disciplined policy in the past. But even if the limits are new  they must be respected. Overheating is a natural product of expansions that overtax these limits. Recessions typically follow overheating. Good policy must therefore balance regularities and possibilities. BIS Review 85/1997

Macfarlane  to the 26th Conference of Economists in Hobart on 29/9/97. Introduction It is a pleasure to be speaking at this year’s Conference of Economists on a subject which has been central to my own career. I thought of calling the speech “Monetary Regimes I Have Known”  but that would have given too historical an emphasis. While history is extremely important  and provides a useful antidote to excessively abstract thinking  more is needed to satisfy the Conference theme of “policy challenges of the new century”. I have therefore attempted to respond in a forward-looking way  by drawing some conclusions about the direction in which monetary policy regimes are likely to evolve. Historical overview In broad outline  Australia’s post-war monetary policy experience has much in common with that of other countries in the developed world. Certainly the starting point -- a fixed exchange rate under the Bretton Woods system -- was the same  and several of the subsequent phases have been common to a significant number of countries. We can usefully divide the post-war monetary policy experience in Australia into four main parts: the fixed exchange rate period  which lasted until the early 1970s; a period of monetary targeting between 1976 and 1985; a transitional period which followed the demise of monetary targeting and lasted until the early 1990s; and the inflation-targeting regime  in place since around 1993. While every country has its own particular story to tell  something similar to this four-part schema  with suitable adjustments as to timing  could probably be applied to quite a wide range of other countries over the same period. In making this classification of policy regimes  it is wise to avoid being overly precise about dates. Sometimes regime shifts are quite dramatic and can be precisely dated -- for example  the ending of US dollar convertibility into gold  and the United Kingdom’s exit from the European exchange rate mechanism -- but this is not invariably the case. In Australia  the movement between regimes has tended to be evolutionary  and it is not always possible or helpful to date them precisely. How did these four regimes perform  and what were the critical factors that led to the move from each regime to its successor? To answer these questions we need to have in mind some criteria against which the performance of a monetary policy regime can be assessed. Most practitioners and theorists would  I think  agree on two desirable characteristics of a monetary policy regime. First  policy needs to provide a nominal anchor for the economy: the policy regime must have the characteristic that it systematically resists excessive inflation or deflation  and thereby delivers a satisfactory degree of price stability in the long run. The second objective is to provide a degree of stabilisation in the short to medium term in response to shocks  which includes resisting adverse shocks to output and employment. This objective might be met either through the capacity of a regime to undertake deliberate policy responses when shocks occur  or through automatic stabilisers inherent in the regime. BIS Review 90/1997 The fixed exchange rate period - 2 - The longest lasting of the four regimes  by a large margin  was the fixed exchange rate  also known as the Bretton Woods system  or the gold exchange standard. At the start of the post-war period  the Australian currency had already been fixed to sterling at an unchanged rate since 1931. Subsequently  there were only two major changes to Australia’s international parities until the 1970s: the first  in 1949  when Australia followed a sterling devaluation against gold and the US dollar  and the second  in 1967  when sterling was further devalued  but Australia did not follow. Thus  Australia’s exchange rate against sterling remained unchanged from 1931 to 1967  while the rate against the US dollar -- which is more important for current purposes -- was unchanged from 1949 to 1971. As was the case for most other countries  the Bretton Woods system of “fixed but adjustable” exchange rates was operated in practice in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s as a firm commitment to fixed parities. The fixed exchange rate was effectively the linchpin of the monetary policy regime. While it is not possible to pinpoint an exact date at which this ceased to be the case  parity adjustments became much more frequent after the next Australian dollar realignment occurred in 1971. Rather than being the anchor of policy  the exchange rate henceforward was increasingly viewed as an adjustable policy instrument. There were six parity changes in the years from 1971 to the adoption of the crawling peg system in November 1976; and this more flexible system  in turn  gave way to the float in December 1983. The history can thus be characterised as involving essentially fixed parities up until 1971  followed by a gradual transition to greater flexibility and a stronger internal policy focus in the years that followed. An important characteristic of a fixed exchange rate system  of course  is that it provides a nominal anchor  as long as the monetary policy of the country to which the exchange rate is fixed is itself conducted in a way that is consistent with reasonable price stability. This was indeed the case for most of the period up to around 1970. Under the Bretton Woods or gold exchange standard  most currencies were pegged to the US dollar  whose value was in turn tied to gold. The central role of the US dollar in the system placed a strong discipline on the macro-economic policies of other countries. Unless countries were prepared to make significant unilateral exchange rate adjustments  which happened only rarely  their inflation performances in the longer run were effectively determined by US monetary policy. Private Consumption Deflator Four-quarter-ended percentage change OPEC I (Oct-73) Australia United States 1960 1962 1964 1966 1968 1970 1972 1974 1976 15 10 5 0 -5 15 10 5 0 -5 As I have argued elsewhere  this system worked reasonably well until the second half of the 1960s. The United States for the most part conducted conservative monetary and fiscal policies that kept budgets close to balance and inflation low  and this underpinned a period of sustained low BIS Review 90/1997 inflation in other countries. In Australia  apart from some periods influenced by sharp commodity price movements  inflation was generally low and close to US rates. This situation began to change from around the mid 1960s. Tax cuts in the 1964 and 1965 budgets  and subsequent increases in defence spending associated with the Vietnam War  shifted US fiscal policy to an expansionary position. Inflation began to increase  albeit from very low levels  after about 1965  and balance of payments deficits run by the United States meant that a number of other countries began accumulating substantial dollar reserves. This fed the process of money creation in these countries and relaxed the constraints on their domestic macro-economic policies  with the result in many cases that inflation rates increased. Causes of the eventual breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in the face of these pressures have been much debated  but the core of most explanations is that the system lost its capacity to provide effective policy discipline. This  in turn  reflected the loss of suitability of the US dollar as the system’s nominal anchor  the role it had played so effectively over the two previous decades. It is interesting to note that the policy debate in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s paid little or no explicit attention to the nominal anchoring role of the monetary regime. That is not because the problem of inflation was thought to be unimportant -- on the contrary  the need to control inflation was well recognised. Nonetheless the main focus  both of practitioners and of the economics profession more widely  was on the second of the two roles of monetary policy that I outlined earlier  namely its role in responding to shorter-term shocks. In fact  many commentators talked of monetary policy as though it was totally discretionary and free to pursue whatever domestic objective it thought most worthy (see next section on Phillips curve). Perhaps the most important reason for this misapprehension was that the existence of the long-run anchor was simply taken for granted. Policy did not need to focus on achieving a good longer-run inflation performance because the fixed exchange rate regime delivered this result in a semi-automatic fashion. In this environment it was natural to focus on shorter-term objectives  with the balance of payments serving as an important barometer of the need for policy action: whenever domestic demand was too strong  this would quickly show up in a payments deficit which needed to be corrected by tighter policy  and vice versa. In this way  the policy regime ensured that actions taken in response to short-term demand pressures had the effect of consistently tying the economy in to the long-run anchor. The eventual failure of the fixed exchange rate system to ensure continued good macro-economic performance reflected a combination of circumstances. The expansionary shift in US policy  to which I have already referred  meant that the external anchor became increasingly a source of inflationary pressure rather than of price stability. This was the case not just for Australia  but worldwide. In Australia’s case  however  the effect was amplified in the early 1970s by the related phenomenon of rising commodity prices  which had a disproportionate effect on Australia  given our high commodity export exposure. The effect was to relax the balance of payments constraint and allow a further loosening of domestic policy discipline  with the result that the rise in Australia’s inflation rate soon overtook that in the United States. The role of the 1973 oil shock in all of this was also important  but it should be remembered that inflation in Australia had already reached double-digit rates before the oil shock occurred. The rise and fall of the Phillips curve The early to mid 1970s was a period of re-evaluation of the earlier conventional thinking about monetary policy  prompted by the experience of a number of years of rising inflation. It is interesting to focus on the nature of that re-evaluation because it remains relevant to policy today. BIS Review 90/1997 - 4 - In the 1960s  the conventional thinking was summed up in the widely-influential notion of a stable downward-sloping Phillips curve. Inflation was thought of in terms of demand-driven processes that would move the economy along the curve  so that high levels of demand would produce a combination of high inflation and low unemployment  and low levels of demand the reverse. The role of policy was to manage aggregate demand so as to achieve a preferred combination of outcomes  taking the position of the Phillips curve as given. Of course  not all economists subscribed to this simplistic world view  but I think it is a fair representation of the consensus among those economists who were most influential and among a broad range of other policy makers  politicians and journalists. There was considerable confidence for a time that policy could effectively manage the trade-off. Policy before about 1970 had been quite successful: periods of clearly excessive inflation had been rare  and were quickly reversed when they occurred. But there developed a general tendency among policy-makers in the late 1960s and early 1970s to try to exploit the trade-off to extract more growth  in the belief that the cost in terms of inflation would not be too great. The experience of the 1970s -- the simultaneous rise in inflation and unemployment  and their persistence at high levels -- proved this understanding of the economy to be too simplistic and an inadequate guide for policy. To a mindset based on the stable Phillips curve  the combination of high inflation and high unemployment could not be readily explained. Indeed  it appeared internally contradictory  since inflation was thought of as a symptom of excess demand while high unemployment signalled that demand was deficient. Two factors needed to be brought into the conventional model in order to understand the 1970s experience. The first  which had been emphasised both by Friedman and by Phelps  was the role of expectations. The short-run Phillips curve was to be thought of not as a permanent trade-off  but as conditional on the expected rate of inflation. Expansionary demand conditions were associated with higher-than-expected inflation  rather than high inflation per se  so the trade-off of higher inflation for lower unemployment could only be exploited over the limited period in which inflation expectations did not fully adjust to the new higher rate. In the longer run  when expectations had adjusted  high inflation would have no stimulatory impact. In Friedman’s words  “a rising rate of inflation may reduce unemployment  a high rate will not”. The operation of this principle had not previously been observable because inflation had never stayed high for long enough to be built into expectations. The second  and related  factor to be brought into the conventional model was the importance of supply shocks. These could be thought of as shocks which reduced the sustainable levels of output and employment consistent with steady inflation. For much of the world the quintessential supply shocks were rises in oil prices but  for Australia  the real wages shock of 1974 was probably at least as important. Recognition of the importance of supply shocks implied a corresponding recognition of the limitations on what could be achieved through conventional demand-management policies. Although economic thinking has advanced in a number of ways since the 1970s  these two basic lessons from the period remain relevant  and often need repeating. While the economics profession was quick to take up the stable Phillips curve  it was also quick in dropping it as a policy prescription. But there are still some in the policy debate -- particularly among politicians  lobbyists and journalists -- who think of the economy in terms of a stable Phillips curve  and who would like us to choose a higher inflation rate on the assumption that this would produce a sustained lift in growth and employment. But that is not the choice we face. Higher inflation can deliver at best only a temporary stimulus to growth and  in the longer run  is more likely to be detrimental. BIS Review 90/1997 The move to monetary targeting In the light of the early 1970s experience  economists stopped assuming a stable Phillips curve and started looking for ways to anchor monetary policy decisions. The Friedman suggestion of a steady growth of the money supply sufficient to accommodate normal economic growth and low inflation found favour in a number of countries. Several had been focusing on monetary aggregates since the early 1970s and  by 1975  a number  including the United States  Germany  the United Kingdom and Switzerland were announcing monetary targets. Australia followed suit in 1976 by beginning to announce forecasts for the growth of M3. These were subsequently announced each year in the federal budget until the practice was discontinued in 1985. The nature of the targets was somewhat different to what is often assumed in the textbooks or in the somewhat idealised notions of monetary theorists. In no country were targets adhered to with the sort of mechanical precision envisaged in Friedman’s Program for Monetary Stability  the classic statement of the case for monetary targeting. They were usually seen as guides to policy  and as vehicles for explaining the rationale of policy actions  rather than being binding constraints on the policy-maker. Monetary targeting regimes had a moderate degree of success in achieving their intermediate monetary objectives  and somewhat greater success in terms of the ultimate objective of reducing inflation. In the heyday of monetary targeting around the world  roughly from 1975 to 1985  some substantial reductions in inflation were achieved. Australia’s inflation rate was reduced during this period  but was still a lot higher than the OECD average by the mid 1980s. It would be a mistake to attribute the differences in inflation performance across countries primarily to differing degrees of rigour in the pursuit of monetary targets. The countries that brought inflation under control most quickly were not particularly more successful in hitting their monetary targets than the rest. The general pattern  summarised in Table 1  was that countries achieved their targets about half the time. Australia’s success rate was a bit less than that  about a third. On another measure -- the average deviation from the target midpoint -- Australia’s record was quite similar to that of several other countries.

What was critical was the willingness of the authorities to run policies that put a consistent downward pressure on inflation over a period of time. But  that said  the targets did serve a useful purpose. They focused policy on the need to anchor the nominal magnitudes in the economy  and they helped in communicating the anti-inflation strategy to the public and marshalling public BIS Review 90/1997 - 6 - acceptance of the required policy actions. The Volcker disinflation period in the United States was a good example of how useful targets could be in this role. Alan Blinder described the monetary target as a “heat shield” which enabled the Fed to maintain a much tougher disinflationary stance than the public would normally have found acceptable. As a result the United States was able to make a definitive transition to low inflation at an early stage. Monetary targeting was always subject to two well-known problems  both of which were important in the Australian experience. The first was the problem of controllability. The fact that targets were often missed was an indication that close control was either not possible  or would have required undesirable movements in the policy instruments. The second was the instability of the relationship between money supply and the ultimate objective of policy such as inflation or nominal GDP. It was this second problem that was decisive in causing most countries to abandon monetary targeting as the basis of their monetary policies. By the mid 1980s  the problem of instability was coming to the fore. The relationship of money to ultimate objectives had always been imprecise  but had been judged to be sufficiently stable to serve as a useful guide to policy. But the structural changes in the financial system that followed deregulation were sufficiently large that this was no longer the case. In Australia  in the mid 1980s  the newly deregulated banks were able to win back market share from other institutions  and the financial system as a whole began to grow more rapidly. To some extent  this was to be expected  but it meant a lengthy period in which the behaviour of the monetary and financial aggregates diverged from inflation or nominal income. In 1985  growth of M3 reached 17.5 per cent  at a time when domestic inflation had been falling. The problem was not unique to Australia. By the time our targets were suspended in February 1985  many other countries had downgraded or abandoned them  for much the same reasons. In the words of Canadian central bank Governor Bouey  “we didn’t abandon the monetary aggregates  they abandoned us”. The transitional period The move away from monetary targets was followed by a period of transition when policies became more pragmatic and there was a search for alternative guiding principles. Once again  Australia’s experience was by no means unique. Virtually all countries were downgrading their monetary targets to one degree or another  and there was no immediately clear direction as to what should be put in their place. Theory offered little help. Some of the alternatives being put up by critics either had already proven unsatisfactory for us -- like a return to fixed exchange rates or forms of monetary targeting -- or were unrealistically radical. Most countries with floating exchange rates developed a pragmatic approach that  broadly speaking  tried to resist excessive inflation and to have some stabilising influence on economic activity in response to shorter-term shocks. Policy in Australia through this transitional period has been criticised for lacking a clear conceptual framework and allowing too much scope for central bank discretion  and there is some validity in these criticisms. In Australia  the policy “checklist”  which entered the discussion for a few years following the abandonment of monetary targets  comprised a wide range of variables which were to be consulted in assessing economic conditions and making policy decisions. The list of variables included interest rates  the exchange rate  the monetary aggregates  inflation  the external accounts  asset prices and the general economic outlook -- in short  an amalgam of instruments  intermediate and final policy objectives  and general macro-economic indicators. The checklist conveyed the idea -- sensible as far as it goes -- that policy needs to look at all relevant information. What was missing was some framework for evaluating that information and converting it into an operational guide for policy. BIS Review 90/1997 Another way of expressing this is to say that monetary policy needed a “nominal anchor”. Pure pragmatism was not enough because it could lead to monetary policy aiming to achieve a desired result for a “real variable”  which in the long run would be self-defeating. For example  if monetary policy was solely designed to achieve a given unemployment rate (as to some extent it was in the late 1960s/early 1970s in many countries)  it would be continually eased whenever the actual unemployment rate was above the desired rate. But if the desired rate was too ambitious  this would be a recipe for continued easing and  in time  continuously rising inflation. At the same time  there would be no guarantee that monetary policy alone would be able to achieve the desired unemployment rate if structural factors were important. Similarly  indeterminacy would arise if monetary policy was directed at the current account of the balance of payments  as a lot of discussion in the late 1980s seemed to suggest. If the current account was too large  should monetary policy be tightened to reduce domestic demand (and imports)  or should it be loosened to lower the exchange rate and hence increase competitiveness? These sorts of discussion led policy-makers and academics to again ask the question about what monetary policy could achieve in the long run. The nearly unanimous answer was that it could achieve a desired rate of inflation  but could not  of itself  achieve desired outcomes for real variables like the unemployment rate  the rate of growth  or variables like the balance of payments. Monetary policy can have an influence for good or bad on real variables  particularly in the short run  but it was not appropriate to target it at these variables. As a long-run target  what was needed was a nominal variable like inflation  nominal GDP or the money supply. With the money demand function recognised as being unstable  and nominal GDP being too abstract a concept for easy public perception  attention turned to monetary policy regimes that centred on inflation. Two main alternatives presented themselves: a system where the instrument of monetary policy was operated to achieve a desired result for inflation  without the need for an intermediate target; or a system where the exchange rate was fixed to that of another country which had a good record of maintaining low inflation. In short  the two alternatives which satisfied the condition of providing a “nominal anchor” were inflation targeting or fixing the exchange rate (sometimes called the hard currency option). Australia went down the first path  while most of Europe (including the United Kingdom for a time) went down the second path by tying their currencies to the Deutschemark. Some would argue that this two-way classification of the options is too narrow and that monetary targeting remains a viable third option  at least for some countries. Germany is often cited as an example. This view ignores the reality that the Bundesbank has moved a long way away from strict monetary targeting in recent years  as is evident from the way they move their policy instrument. There is evidence to suggest that prospective inflationary developments are more likely to trigger a monetary policy move than is a deviation of money supply from its target. Inflation targeting Unlike the experience in some other countries like the United Kingdom or New Zealand  where inflation targets came into force in dramatic regime shifts  the elements of Australia’s inflation-targeting regime were put in place gradually. There were a number of reasons for this. While inflation targets had considerable conceptual appeal  the models adopted in the pioneering countries - New Zealand and Canada - seemed to us excessively rigid with their narrow bands and low target mid-points. The fact that these were the only working models available at the time tended to polarise debate  and it took some time for the Bank to develop its own more flexible version. Also BIS Review 90/1997 - 8 - important was the need to build public support  including political support  for a target  and again this happened gradually rather than in a single  decisive act. Some of the key elements of the inflation-targeting approach were in place quite early. The conceptual basis of such an approach  with a focus on inflation as the policy objective  no intermediate objective  interest rates as the instrument  and a transmission process that works via the effect of interest rates on private demand  had been analysed in a number of pieces that the Bank published in 1989  including its conference volume. What we now consider one of the key elements of the policy framework  the explicit announcements of cash rate changes  with explanations of the reasons for each change  began in January 1990. Over time  the Bank’s published commentaries on monetary policy and the economy became more detailed and developed a stronger inflation focus. The numerical objective of 2-3 per cent inflation began appearing in public statements by Governor Fraser in 1992 and 1993. The cumulative effect of all these developments was to establish an inflation-targeting regime broadly comparable to those being developed in a number of other countries around the same time. While there was no individual decisive event  international comparative tables such as those published by the BIS date the change in Australia from 1993. A final element was added with the joint statement on the conduct of monetary policy  made by myself and the Treasurer on my appointment as Governor. The statement gave the Government’s formal endorsement to the independence of the Reserve Bank as contained in its Act and to the 2-3 per cent target. It also provided for enhanced accountability through semi-annual statements and parliamentary appearances. Several other countries adopted inflation targets around the same time as Australia. A recent survey by the BIS counts seven inflation targeters  making this currently the most numerically popular regime among medium-sized OECD countries (Table 2). As had been the case with previous regime changes  the immediate reason for change in many cases was either a breakdown of a previous regime or dissatisfaction with its performance. In the United Kingdom  Sweden and Finland  the trigger was the collapse of fixed exchange rate commitments in 1992. New Zealand and Canada adopted their targets in a deliberate strategy of inflation reduction. Australia was somewhat different in that there was no crisis that needed to be responded to  and the target was developed to cement in place an inflation reduction that had already been achieved. Table 2: Inflation Targets Current target Country 0-3% New Zealand 1-3% Canada 2½% United Kingdom 1-3% Sweden 2% Finland 2-3% Australia Spain 0-3% Source: BIS 1996 Annual Report  updated to incorporate recent changes to targets in the United Kingdom and New Zealand Target adopted March 1990 February 1991 October 1992 January 1993 February 1993 1993 Summer 1994 The move to inflation targeting completed a significant conceptual leap from the regimes that had prevailed in the earlier decades. Instead of a focus on intermediate objectives  like the exchange rate or the money supply  the operational framework of policy was now built around a final objective  inflation. In describing inflation as the final objective in this context  I should make clear that inflation control is viewed as a means to an end rather than an end in itself. The reason monetary regimes have been set up to aim for low inflation is that this is the best contribution monetary policy can make in the longer run to growth in output  employment and living standards. BIS Review 90/1997 In principle  this approach re-establishes a clear nominal anchor while avoiding the main problem of the intermediate-targeting regimes -- namely  that the target variables did not have a sufficiently stable relationship with the final objectives. The approach also preserves  from the transitional period that I described earlier  the common-sense notion of using all relevant information: the difference is that there is now a clear criterion -- the impact on the inflation outlook -- for assessing what the information means for policy. Another property of inflation targets  not always well-recognised  is that they provide scope for counter-cyclical action. This is automatically built into the policy framework if a central bank takes seriously  as we do  both the upper and lower bounds of the target. When the inflation forecast is above the target  the framework requires policy to be tightened  as was the case a couple of years ago  and  when it is below target  policy has to be more expansionary  as at present. In this way the policy framework incorporates a systematic resistance to cyclical demand pressures. I have described this previously by saying that the policy aims to allow the economy to grow as fast as possible  consistent with low inflation  but no faster. Aside from these operational characteristics  an important dimension of the economic rationale for inflation targets is their role as a discipline on the policy process. The academic literature lays great store on this -- particularly in the time inconsistency literature -- although it tends to focus rather too narrowly on the idea of constraining the policy-makers. The targets are seen as correcting an inflationary bias that would otherwise arise from the temptation of central bankers to go for short-term expansion. In this literature  rule-based regimes are said to be superior to discretion because they allow pre-commitment to non-inflationary policies  and thereby overcome the assumed short-termism of the policy-makers. Central bankers are very sceptical of this line of analysis because we do not see ourselves as inherently inflation-prone. But while I think this particular argument for a rule-based approach somewhat misses the point  the ability to specify policy in terms of a relatively simple rule does have some important advantages. In particular  simple rules provide a ready vehicle for accountability and for public communication: they require policy actions to be explained in terms of a clear target  and they help central banks to resist calls for excessively expansionary policies. Also important is that  over time  a simple rule like an inflation target can provide a focal point for inflation expectations by making clear what the central bank is aiming at. One of the reasons that inflation targets have proven attractive to so many countries is that they seem to strike a workable balance  between having these advantages of a simple rule  and retaining a necessary degree of flexibility. The framework has simplicity in terms of an easily communicated objective  at the same time as having flexibility in the interpretation of information and operation of the policy instrument -- a combination of characteristics that Mishkin refers to as “constrained discretion”. While the essential characteristics of inflation targets are common to all the practitioners  there are some interesting variations across countries in the detailed design features. These involve characteristics like the target mid-point  the width of fluctuation bands and the timeframe for evaluating performance. Australia’s system differs from the early models (particularly New Zealand) by focusing on a midpoint of 2-3 per cent (which really means “about 2½”) rather than a range. The most common target mid-point is 2 per cent: Australia and the United Kingdom are slightly higher at 2½ and New Zealand lower at 1½ (having originally been at 1). There is also a difference concerning the meaning of the upper and lower bounds. In the original New Zealand and Canadian models  inflation was meant to be always within the band  but in our variation that was never the intention. BIS Review 90/1997 - 10 - At this level of detail there is no single consensus model as to how an inflation target should be designed. To some extent  the variations reflect the different historical circumstances of each country. For example  New Zealand  which had the first and the most tightly specified system  also had one of the poorest track records on inflation and therefore the clearest need to signal a regime shift. Notwithstanding these differences  the essentials -- a numerically specified target linked to procedures of public explanation and accountability -- are common to all the inflation targets. The future To the best of my knowledge  inflation targeting was not seriously canvassed as a monetary policy option until the 1980s. By the end of that decade  however  as I have described earlier  there were only two monetary policy regimes that held out the promise of being achievable and of providing a nominal anchor -- the first was the hard currency option and the second was an inflation target. It is my view that  as we approach the next century  the field will narrow further  and that inflation targeting will become the dominant monetary policy regime. This would be a remarkable change for a system that was virtually unheard of until the second half of the 1980s. The reason for this change is that the biggest group of countries that have chosen the hard currency option -- the members of the European Monetary System (EMS) -- are scheduled on 1 January 1999 to achieve monetary union. On that date  there will be one European currency -- the Euro -- and one European Central Bank -- the ECB. What will be the monetary policy regime pursued by the ECB? It cannot be the hard currency option because the Euro will be a floating currency. My guess is that  whatever the ECB chooses  it will rather closely resemble inflation targeting. An alternative view is that in order to impress markets that the Euro is as sound as the Deutschemark  the ECB may follow something akin to the German practice of monetary targeting. As I said earlier  this would not alter the picture very much  as current German practice seems to be at least as much like inflation targeting as it is like monetary targeting. In this new world  there will be three major currencies  which will float against each other -- the US dollar  the yen and the Euro. Of course  none of these are in the group of countries that has an explicit inflation target  but I have argued elsewhere that if you had to fit the United States into one or the other of the formal monetary policy regimes  the one that comes closest is inflation targeting. The target is not explicit  but the Fed makes no secret of the fact that it is its assessment of inflationary pressures and the outlook for inflation that is the major determinant of whether US monetary policy is adjusted. The Fed’s behaviour over the last month has made that abundantly clear. Japan is a more difficult case to classify  but the evidence is that with inflation virtually non-existent  interest rates have been reduced to about the lowest conceivable level (the cash rate is ½ per cent). Thus  among the traditional OECD countries  we have a group of explicit inflation targeters and another group -- the big three -- who have systems which could most appropriately be called implicit inflation targeters. Outside the OECD area  there is still room for countries to choose the hard currency option - Hong Kong for the past 13 years and Argentina (for a considerably shorter time) -- fit this description. But recent events in Asia as well as in other regions such as Eastern Europe in recent years may have made the fixed exchange rate option less attractive in many cases. If we take an even longer sweep of history  we can see that we entered this century with the most irrevocably fixed exchange rate system yet devised  namely the gold standard. As we enter the next century  we enter a world where floating exchange rates are the norm  and where the role of nominal anchor will be predominantly played by an inflation target  whether it is explicit  much as our own  or implicit as is the case in the United States.

Phillips  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  before the Subcommittee on Capital Markets  Securities and Government Sponsored Enterprises of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services  U.S. House of Representatives  on 1/10/97. I welcome this opportunity to discuss the Federal Reserve Board’s views on proposed accounting standards for derivatives and risk management activities issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). In approaching this complex matter  it should be acknowledged up front that most responsible observers and market participants share an interest in improved accounting standards and disclosure of information that is useful and relevant to the broad range of users of financial statements. Thus  the desirability of meaningful disclosure is not the issue. All would agree  I think  that enhanced financial disclosure and market transparency can lead to more efficient financial markets  more accurate pricing of risks  and more effective market discipline. With respect to financial disclosures  the interests of most firm managers  investors  and other market participants are essentially the same. Market participants can benefit from enhanced disclosure by being in a better position to understand the financial condition of their counterparties and competitors. Investors have an obvious interest in being able to make meaningful assessments of a firm’s performance  underlying trends  and income-producing potential. Sound  well-managed firms can benefit if better disclosure enables them to obtain funds at risk premiums that accurately reflect their lower risk profiles. Inadequate financial disclosures  on the other hand  could penalize well-managed firms if market participants are unable to assess their fundamental financial strength. While most market participants favor sound accounting standards and meaningful disclosure  a key question is how to ensure that accounting practices and techniques reflect  and are consistent with  how a business is run  that is  its overall business strategy. Indeed  accounting methodology should measure the results of a business purpose or strategy  and not be an end in itself. For example  in the case of a company that actively trades financial instruments or other products to profit from short-term price movements  such as a securities firm  reporting trading positions at fair values appropriately measures the success or failure of that business strategy  and market participants expect this reporting treatment. However  for many other types of businesses  such as a manufacturer or a lender that funds loans with liabilities of equal maturity  market value accounting in the primary financial statements may not accurately reflect business strategies or appropriately measure the firm’s underlying performance and condition. In these cases  although information about fair value can be useful in supplemental disclosures  it is questionable whether there is widespread demand for market value accounting to become the basis for the preparation of the primary financial statements. Although the needs of financial statement users may vary  a critical function of financial statements is to reflect in a meaningful way underlying trends in the financial performance and condition of the firm. The application of market value accounting to business strategies where it is not appropriate  and particularly when applied on a piecemeal basis  may lead to increased volatility or fluctuation in reported results and actually obscure underlying trends or developments affecting a firm’s condition and performance. Requiring companies to adopt market value accounting where it is not consistent with their business strategies can cause them to incur significant costs to provide information that may not reflect in a meaningful way their underlying circumstances or trends in their performance. Moreover  from the standpoint of financial statement analysts and other users  having to make adjustments to remove the effects of this accounting volatility from income statements and balance sheets -- volatility that is not consistent with firm’s risk positions -- can also impose significant costs without offsetting benefits. BIS Review 90/1997 - 2 - These problems can be minimized by placing market values in meaningful supplemental disclosures rather than by forcing their use in the primary financial statements. Such an approach would give analysts the information they need  without imposing the broader costs of having to reverse or back out the effects of artificial volatility from the primary financial statements. Of course  financial statements and supplemental disclosures must be accurate and not misrepresent a firm’s financial circumstances -- a problem that can be minimized when financial reports are subject to thorough review by management and external auditors. Federal Reserve’s Experience The Federal Reserve Board has a long-standing interest in the quality of financial reporting. This arises from our role as the nation’s central bank  and as the supervisor of bank holding companies  state member banks  and the U.S. operations of foreign banking organizations (FBOs). The Federal Reserve and other bank supervisors are responsible for assessing the safety and soundness of the institutions they regulate. In this regard  the Federal Reserve relies on off-site monitoring  on-site supervision  capital and other regulatory requirements  and policies that encourage sound risk management practices. We believe that market discipline -- supported by appropriate accounting standards and public disclosure -- complement these supervisory efforts by fostering healthy financial institutions and efficient capital markets. In the course of supervising financial institutions  the Federal Reserve has developed considerable familiarity with financial instruments  both derivative and non-derivative  that are characterized by a wide range of complexity and risk. We have learned that in supervising trading and derivatives activities it is the underlying characteristics of a financial instrument -- and how it contributes to the overall risk profile of the firm -- that are important  not the instrument’s name. Two instruments that differ in name only may have entirely different treatment under existing legal and accounting frameworks  even though the economic risks (including market  credit  liquidity  operational  and reputational risks) they embody are identical. Financial engineering can certainly create derivative instruments that combine risks in complex ways. But the same engineers can create cash instruments that appear simple and traditional  but may have greater risk than many instruments labeled “derivative.” Indeed  placing financial instruments in regulatory or accounting pigeonholes without regard to their true risks and economic functions can create disincentives for prudent risk management. The Federal Reserve is increasingly emphasizing the need for institutions to manage the aggregate or portfolio risks of banking and de-emphasizing a focus on specific instruments. Risk should be measured and managed comprehensively. That is  an institution should manage the dynamics of its portfolio rather than manage specific instruments. A focus on individual transactions can ignore the interaction of the specified instrument with other instruments. Although portfolio theory is widely appreciated by bankers and regulators  putting its principles into practice in banking has not been easy. For example  past banking crises have  in part  reflected a failure by some institutions to recognize and limit concentrations of risk within their portfolios. The Federal Reserve is increasingly recognizing the need for supervisory and regulatory policies to be more “incentive-compatible ” in that they encourage sound risk management within an institution. Furthermore  supervisory and regulatory policies are placing increasing emphasis on minimizing burden by using internal risk measurement systems  and by reinforcing supervisory objectives through market forces. We believe that market discipline -- supported by appropriate accounting standards and public disclosure -- complements our supervisory efforts by fostering strong financial institutions and efficient capital markets. We believe this approach is more constructive than rote adherence to rules and regulations that may not be consistent with the firm’s own risk management systems. BIS Review 90/1997 Consistent with these policies  the Federal Reserve and other banking supervisors have explored regulatory approaches that encourage more use of market-value-based measures in risk management approaches. For example  beginning next year  internationally active banks meeting certain criteria for risk management will calculate the amount of capital necessary to support the market risk of their trading activities using their own internal value-at-risk (VaR) measures. A significant effort that could increase supervisory reliance on market discipline in the future is the Federal Reserve’s so-called “pre-commitment” approach to determining capital for market risk. It seeks to provide banks with stronger regulatory and market incentives to improve all aspects of market risk management. Other initiatives have improved the focus of our supervision policies and examination practices on institutions’ risk profiles and risk management activities in ways that emphasize sound practices and strong internal controls. Moreover  the Federal Reserve has called for improved U.S. accounting and disclosure standards and has had a key role in sponsoring major international initiatives to encourage improved disclosures by the largest banks and securities firms of their trading and derivatives activities. For example  our 1995 and 1996 analyses of the derivatives disclosure by the top ten U.S. dealer banks were used as models for the joint reports by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Organization of Securities Commissions  which covered a sample of the largest banks and securities firms in the G-10 countries. These studies revealed major differences in disclosure among the participating countries and highlighted the greater level of disclosure by U.S. dealer banks. In addition  a representative of the Federal Reserve chaired an international working group of the Euro-currency Standing Committee that recommended in 1994 improvements to disclosure by financial intermediaries of the credit and market risks of their trading activities. The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies also developed improvements in derivatives disclosure standards for regulatory reports that are similar to disclosure requirements issued at the same time by FASB in Statement No. 119  “Disclosure about Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments.” Specific Issues Raised by the Derivatives Proposal We share several objectives with the FASB for improving financial reporting. For example  we both support the fundamental objectives of promoting clear and understandable financial reports that increase the transparency of companies’ activities. We also share the view that accounting and disclosure standards which faithfully represent financial condition and performance can improve investor and counterparty decisions  thus improving market discipline on banking organizations and other companies. Further  we also agree that current accounting and disclosure standards for derivatives -- as well as for other financial instruments -- should be improved. We recognize the difficult task that FASB has in developing a standard that is acceptable to its many constituents. In this regard  we understand that FASB has considered and rejected a number of approaches to hedge accounting for derivatives because particular problems were identified with each approach. We also believe that the approach of reporting all financial instruments at fair value in the primary set of financial instruments  while having some theoretical appeal at least for some types of firms  is not an appropriate solution in the near term. In this regard  fair value estimation techniques are not yet sufficiently robust for exclusive reliance in financial statements. For example  difficult valuation issues arise for highly illiquid instruments for which fair value is based on models rather than observed prices  core deposits with varying durations  and the liabilities of a firm whose credit quality has weakened. Furthermore  fair value estimates can be highly subjective  and little guidance is available for measuring fair values in the financial statements. Another difficult issue relates to whether fair value is the most relevant measurement for commercial banks and other firms that are in the business of holding illiquid loans and other assets for the long term. The success or failure of such a strategy is not measured by evaluating such loans on the basis BIS Review 90/1997 - 4 - of a price that indicates value in the context of immediate delivery. In this regard  an appropriate value for many bank loans and off-balance-sheet commitments -- the one that reflect the nature of a bank’s business -- is the original acquisition price adjusted for the expectation of performance at maturity. Given the many difficulties of FASB’s task  it is not surprising that their proposal raises a number of complex issues. For example  the proposal is likely to lead to increased volatility in income and stockholders equity by companies that manage risk with derivatives. This volatility could be artificial due to the piecemeal approach of marking certain risk positions to fair value  but not all positions contributing to the risk. As a result  there could be accounting volatility that bears little relation to an institution’s overall risk position. Supervisors and analysts will have to strip out the artificially created volatility to assess the true performance of the firm. On the other hand  companies that do not manage their risks  or manage their risks solely through cash instruments that are not covered by the standard  would not reflect similar volatility. A simple example might illustrate this concern. Assume a company’s activities consist solely of lending long term at fixed rates and funding these loans with variable-rate deposits. I think we can all agree that this company has a significant exposure to interest rate risk. If the company does not manage its risk with derivatives  it would not be affected by the derivatives accounting proposal and would not report any volatility from fair value changes in its financial statements. If  however  the company has a strategy to use derivatives to reduce its interest rate risk and move it closer to a match-funded position  the company may report greater volatility in income and stockholders’ equity -- a result not consistent with its reduced risk exposure. For example  if the company specified under the framework set forth in the FASB proposal that the derivatives are “cash flow” hedges of variable rate liabilities  the company would have volatility in equity or earnings based on the specifically linked effectiveness tests set forth by the proposal. Thus  the firm in using derivatives reduces its economic volatility  yet increases its accounting volatility. More important  by taking a transaction level approach to hedging  the proposal would not describe well the efforts of more sophisticated market participants to hedge their risks on a comprehensive  portfolio basis. Thus  these firms would effectively be required to keep different sets of books  and their financial reporting may not be consistent with the derivatives’ intended use. This leads me to conclude that the proposal could discourage or constrain prudent risk management practices that rely on derivatives. Furthermore  it may not improve transparency of financial information. The proposal also introduces into the financial statements an untested method for reporting loans  deposits  and other assets and liabilities being hedged. These assets and liabilities would be valued at a “hybrid” historical cost and fair value amount on the balance sheet when they are hedged with derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges. For example  generally  the historical cost values of these assets and liabilities would be adjusted for changes in fair value related to the risk being hedged. However  certain other changes in fair value would not be recognized (such as those that arise from other risks  that are the results of an ineffective hedge  or that do not offset a gain or loss on the hedging instrument). These hybrid amounts could differ significantly from -- and potentially exceed -- fair values. They may also be difficult to verify by auditors and examiners  thus reducing the reliability of amounts reported in the financial statements. The proposed approach is complex  which may increase related developmental systems costs. In this regard  the proposal may cause significant systems changes for institutions that hedge with derivatives. At the same time institutions are making these systems changes  they need to upgrade their systems to address Year 2000 issues. The cost of systems changes arising from the derivatives proposal should be evaluated along with other costs and benefits arising from the proposal. This is particularly important since the derivatives proposal is intended by the FASB to be BIS Review 90/1997 an interim treatment  and its long-term goal is to measure all financial instruments at fair value. Indeed  the FASB already has under way a project that is evaluating issues related to that goal. BIS Review 90/1997

Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in Hong Kong  on 21/9/97. Introduction 1. Good afternoon. On behalf of the people of Hong Kong  particularly those of us atthe Hong Kong Monetary Authority  let me extend my warmest welcome to all of you to Hong Kong. For those of you who have visited Hong Kong before  perhaps many times  I hope you are pleased to see that Hong Kong  as a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China  remains as vibrant and dynamic as you have known in the past  retaining much of its free market characteristics  under the principle of “one country  two systems”. 2. It is a great honour and privilege for me to be invited to give this year’s Per Jacobsson Lecture. As a Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  Mr Per Jacobsson led a life that was dedicated to the promotion of both European and later international monetary co-operation. It is only befitting that a lecture held in Asia in memory of this great man should address the topic of Asian monetary co-operation. This is also a subject that has been brought to sharp focus in the light of the recent turmoil in the currency markets of Asia. 3. What I intend to do this afternoon is first to define what international monetary co-operation is about  and in this connection  survey the attitudes of the parties that should have an interest in such co-operation and discuss the form of this co-operation. I wish to point out that these attitudes have  perhaps unintentionally  led to international monetary co-operation being regionalized. I shall then focus specifically on Asian monetary co-operation  covering the history  or the lack of it  and the monetary problems  current and potential ones  that Asian economies face. I shall then make a case for much greater monetary co-operation in Asia. I shall also suggest a way forward for Asian monetary co-operation  with a strategy and a list of issues to be addressed in such co-operation. 4. Let me start now by attempting a definition on what monetary co-operation is about. The Oxford Dictionary defines “co-operation” as “working together to the same end”. So I Monetary Co-operation suppose monetary co-operation can simply be defined as working together to the same monetary end. This then leads to the questions as to what that same monetary end should be  who should be working together and the form in which they should best work together  particularly when one is talking about monetary co-operation across monetary systems on a global or regional dimension. 5. The Articles of Agreement of the IMF provide some guidance on what that same monetary end should be. In defining the purposes of the IMF in Article I to be  among other things  “to promote international monetary co-operation”  the term “consultation and collaboration on international monetary problems” is used. So it would be appropriate to describe that same monetary end as the prevention and cure of monetary problems. Indeed  the rapid pace of financial liberalization and the associated globalization of financial markets have meant that monetary problems  when they arise  can be highly contagious on the global and particularly on a regional dimension. And if they are to be properly handled  by way of prevention or cure  there is a clear need for international monetary co-operation. 6. As to who should be working together  it is quite obvious that the interested parties would necessarily include the monetary authorities of economies facing or potentially exposed to monetary problems. The increasing realization of this need to work together has led to the formation of various  mostly regional  forums where monetary authorities gather to discuss issues of common interest. BIS Review 91/1997 - 2 - 7. Insofar as the Asian region is concerned  these forums are proving to be quite useful  but there is regrettably also some resistance in making further and the much needed progress because of  believe it or not  turf issues between ministries of finance and central banks  or perceived excessive rivalry on the part of individual economies in vying for the lead and influence in the co-operative effort. But these are facts of life that hopefully should not stand too much in the way of progress for the benefit of all in the longer term. It is also a fact of life regrettably that minds do not normally become adequately focused until they are jostled by damaging crises. 8. There are of course the multilateral institutions like the IMF and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)  and a number of international groupings of experts  who have a clear mandate or a keen interest in  among other things  promoting international monetary co-operation. They have been invaluable in providing the necessary support and guidance to monetary co-operation in Asia. 9. Nevertheless  some in this region have felt that such support and guidance  particularly from the multilateral institutions  have been less forthcoming than they would have liked  comparing for example the support given to Thailand with Mexico. They also feel that the special circumstances and interests of economies in the region have not been adequately taken into account. Nor do their voices count for enough. 10. Whether or not this feeling is justified  one consequence is for regional initiatives to surface. This is no bad thing and perhaps the pragmatic way forward  given the need realistically to address regional disparities in financial markets  infrastructure and degrees of financial liberalization. But the down side risk which all of us should be aware of is the possibility that the global financial market may then become segmented into regional blocs which may result in more competition and friction  rather than co-operation. 11. On the form of monetary co-operation  there is a wide spectrum of experience on the basis of current practice. There is on the one extreme the simple exchange of information and expertise amongst monetary authorities helpful to the management of the domestic monetary system generally  covering the whole range of central banking functions in the management of the currency  the supervision of financial institutions  the development of the financial infrastructure  the management of foreign reserves  etc. On the other extreme  there is monetary co-operation to the extent of achieving monetary union or integration. 12. In between the two extremes there are arrangements for policy co-ordination at the macro level initiated on the realization of increasing international  particularly regional  economic interdependence. There are also the more focused schemes for mutual assistance in the provision of liquidity to facilitate effective monetary management  which may or may not involve the assumption of credit risks between governments. There have also been considerable efforts spent in supervisory co-operation towards the standardization of supervisory practices in order to promote international financial stability  again in recognition of the possibility of the damaging contagion effect of financial crises across financial systems. Then there are the more forward-looking arrangements for the development and linkages of elements of the financial infrastructure to facilitate the efficient and safe financial intermediation across monetary systems. 13. Obviously no one point on this wide spectrum of international monetary co-operation can be considered as the ideal situation. Much depends on the needs arising from the circumstances  and the circumstances are changing all the time. But along with financial liberalization and the globalization of financial markets  the trend  to the extent that one can be ascertained  seems clearly to be one of increasing monetary co-operation. As is well known  European monetary co-operation is aiming for monetary integration by 1999  having moved in the past 50 years from BIS Review 91/1997 - 3 - information exchange to policy co-ordination. Whether this could be achieved on time or not  and whether monetary integration should necessarily then be considered as the final goal of monetary co-operation in other regions  we shall have to wait and see. But one has to admire the vision of the pioneer thinkers. I understand that the French economist Jacques Rueff actually declared way back in the 1950s that “Europe will be created via a currency or not at all”. 14. By contrast  Asian monetary co-operation is considerably less well structured. There is traditionally some exchange of information  mostly on a bilateral basis  through meetings conducted annually  and largely prior to a game of golf or even on the golf course. There is little  if any  policy co-ordination amongst Asian economies  not to mention any interest in monetary integration. It is not clear whether this is a reflection of reluctance to subject domestic policy decisions to external influence. Indeed  until recently the majority of the economies in the region seemed happy to concede their sovereign right over monetary policy to the central banks of their major trading partners  notably the United States  through maintaining a stable exchange rate against the US dollar by varying degrees. But whatever the reason for the relative lack of monetary co-operation in the past  there have been significant changes recently  spurred by the events surrounding Mexico which affected the region and those of Thailand which is right in the middle of our region. There is serious and continuing discussion on the subject of Asian monetary co-operation. Hong Kong stands ready to contribute to this discussion and I very much hope that a long term strategy could come out of this. History of Asian Monetary Co-operation 15. Let me now describe briefly to you the history of Asian monetary co-operation. In the post-war period  many Asian central banks evolved from colonial currency boards  which practised the virtue of stable money fixed to an international reserve currency. As a result of this monetary discipline  supported by sound fiscal discipline  Asia has enjoyed stable growth with low inflation. As Asian economies gradually opened their markets to international trade and competition  with Hong Kong setting a good example of how free markets work  the existence of stable exchange rates  largely linked to the US dollar  formed the anchor of Asian growth. The need for monetary co-operation amongst Asian economies  therefore  did not matter much as long as each traded mainly with Europe or America using the US dollar as the main currency of trade. 16. This was the reason why the work of the principal forum for central bank discussions in the late 1950s called SEANZA (South East Asia  New Zealand and Australia) focused mainly at providing training for central bankers. The 18 members of this group cover a geographical area that spans the whole of Asia-Pacific from India to New Zealand. Training and research was also the primary focus of another central bank forum founded in 1966. This is SEACEN (Southeast Asian Central Banks)  comprising ten central bank members with a research and training centre in Kuala Lumpur. 17. In the 1990s  the number of Asia Pacific groupings increased  partly as a result of accelerating intra-regional trade. The establishment of APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation) in 1989 promoted trade and investment amongst the 18 member economies  but there were only ancillary discussions on monetary co-operation. In February 1991  nevertheless  Asian monetary co-operation took a quiet but significant step forward with the creation of EMEAP (Executives’ Meeting of East Asia Pacific Central Banks). This 11-member group of central banks was initiated by the Bank of Japan. At the beginning  EMEAP concentrated on the exchange of information on market developments in the economies of members and was the forum for the Bank of Japan to brief others on G-7 discussions. But it has since evolved into quite a productive  and certainly the most active  forum for central banking discussions in the region to date through its biannual meetings of deputy governors and an annual meeting of governors. BIS Review 91/1997 - 4 - 18. The discussion in EMEAP now has a sharp focus on Asian monetary co-operation. This need was perhaps crystallized by the Mexican crisis  which rippled to Asian currencies in January 1995. In its wake  I convened an informal meeting of several EMEAP central banks that experienced speculative activity. There was immediate agreement that it would be useful to exchange market intelligence and to share knowledge and techniques on monetary operations helpful to the maintenance of monetary stability. Out of this meeting also evolved the package of bilateral repurchase agreements of US Treasuries signed by five central banks in Hong Kong on 20 November 1995 and aimed at the enhancement of the liquidity of the foreign reserves that they hold -- a historic landmark in Asian monetary co-operation that eventually expanded to cover all the eleven EMEAP members. 19. In this connection  I should pay tribute to the foresight of Bernie Fraser  then Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia  who called for the establishment of a new regional institution -- for want of a better name  an Asian BIS -- to promote Asian monetary co-operation. Bernie saw quite rightly that “globalisation is elevating the international dimension of monetary co-operation”. In response to his call  EMEAP convened a working group to study the proposals and  at its first Governors’ Meeting in Tokyo in July 1996  further established two working groups and a study group to share knowledge and expertise on financial market development  central bank operations and banking supervision issues respectively. Although the question on the establishment of a regional institution to further Asian monetary co-operation has been put aside for the time being  the progress achieved by the various groups was commendable  with ambitious plans to produce the Asian equivalent of the Green Book on banking supervision  the Red Book on payment systems and a Gold Book on reserve management practices. 20. Meanwhile  greater international monetary co-operation involving the Asian economies was also advanced when the BIS admitted the People’s Bank of China  the Reserve Bank of India  the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Bank of Korea  among others  to its membership in 1996  the first new Asian members after the Bank of Japan. 21. All these initiatives were unfortunately overshadowed by the advent of the Thai crisis  which erupted in May this year. But it was still to EMEAP’s credit that in the second Governors’ meeting in Shanghai in July  the group called for the creation of an Asian facility to supplement the IMF in providing assistance to member economies in Asia to make structural adjustments. That historic decision paved the way for the smooth meeting organized by the Fund in Tokyo two weeks later in August when more than US$10 billion out of a total package of US$17 billion facility to Thailand was amassed from EMEAP members with almost no fuss. Meanwhile  the call for an Asian facility is still being considered. Discussions are continuing amongst the interested parties  whenever opportunities present themselves. Asian Monetary Problems 22. It is perhaps one of the ironies of the post-Bretton Woods era that the modern world is no longer generally short of liquidity  and indeed is arguably at present overflush with liquidity. Yet amidst all this liquidity and prosperity  liquidity crunches can even test the solvency of nations. The currency turbulence in Asia has prompted a realization of this irony and consequently much soul searching on the appropriateness of exchange rate and other monetary arrangements  macroeconomic and structural adjustment policies  the adequacy of financial market regulation and banking supervision  the pace of financial liberalization  etc. Many words of wisdom are being offered. While some are critical of the wisdom of fixed exchange rate systems  others blame volatile capital flows and currency speculators for the currency crises in rather strong and emotive terms. Still others fault inappropriate government policies and perhaps complacency in not taking early action. BIS Review 91/1997 - 5 - All in all a rather confusing picture. At the risk of causing even greater confusion  let me try to identify and articulate the monetary problems that Asian economies have been facing. 23. Capital inflow must be at the top of the list. At the beginning of the decade  net capital inflow to emerging markets was less than US$50 billion a year. By 1996  however  this had increased to US$245 billion. Asia has received roughly half of this capital inflow  thanks to the rather attractive basic economic fundamentals. These fundamentals  incidentally  have remained attractive today  notwithstanding the recent turmoil in Asian financial markets. The key factors that contributed to the surge in capital flows into the region include Japan’s willingness to export capital as a result of sustained and large current account surpluses. The rising costs of production in Japan  associated with the appreciation of the yen have forced many Japanese firms to relocate their production to the rest of Asia. Also contributing was the low interest rate policy in the industrial economies  particularly in Japan in the post-bubble phase  which has flooded the global market with liquidity. Increasing amounts of mutual funds and pension funds of these economies looked for higher returns in the emerging markets. Clearly  Asian economies have benefited much from such capital inflows  but at the same time they have exposed themselves to the threat of a sudden loss of market confidence and hence large outflows of funds due to policy mistakes or shifts in the international economic environment. This is particularly true if a large proportion of inflows are volatile portfolio investment or short-term borrowing. 24. The next monetary problem concerns current account deficits. A number of Asian economies were able to run larger than normal current account deficits in the balance of payments because they were easily funded by capital inflows. The bad news about large capital inflows is that they might allow investment and even consumption to expand without enduring the pain of overheating or loss of competitiveness. Higher levels of domestic credit  consumption  investment  growth and even budget revenues can be sustained at the cost of rapid accumulation of foreign debt. To make matters worse  over 80% of the current account deficits of selected Asian economies was funded from short-term bank debt. In hindsight  the ready availability of short-term external financing might have delayed the necessary policy adjustments in face of cyclical and structural changes in the domestic and international economic environment. In short  we can all easily make the mistake of taking capital inflows for granted. 25. Then there is asset price inflation which is a rather common consequence of capital inflows. In an open economic environment  capital inflows may not lead to consumer price inflation  since imports would alleviate excess demand. However  if the domestic financial system is underdeveloped and financial institutions are not adequately supervised  as external hot money increases the deposit base of domestic banks they may be lured into fueling domestic asset price bubbles. These have two major consequences. First  asset price inflation eventually leads to domestic inflation and erodes external competitiveness. Second  excessive lending concentration in real estate exposes financial institutions to large non-performing loans when oversupply of property emerges. Indeed  banks are absorbing credit risk on top of interest rate and exchange rate risks. In some Asian economies  weakness of the financial system has constrained the ability of the monetary authorities to raise interest rates to defend their currencies when the exchange rates are under pressure. Conversely  to allow the currency to depreciate exposes banks and other borrowers to exchange losses on their unhedged foreign currency liabilities. 26. At the same time  the external environment has been changing. Whilst Asia was enjoying an unprecedented boom  the global competitive environment was subtly but surely shifting  which led to portfolio rebalancing by global asset managers. The adjustments in the US economy  through fiscal and monetary tightening  and technology and corporate restructuring  had brought substantial benefits in the form of lower budget deficits  and the lowest levels of unemployment and inflation for decades. In case anyone forgets  the US equity market has in the last three years outperformed almost all Asian equity markets with the exception of that of China. Funds have been BIS Review 91/1997 - 6 - attracted back to the US markets which at the same time strengthened the US dollar  adding to the momentum of that flow. It was a pure case of risk versus return. 27. In addition  growing competition at the low-wage end of industries came from other Asian and non-Asian economies. In Europe  cheaper production came from the restructuring economies of Eastern Europe. Competition came from the revival of Latin American economies with improved access to the US market through NAFTA. In Asia  India and China are emerging as major exporters. As a result  exports in Asia suffered a downturn  while imports continued to rise  leading to growing levels of current account deficits. 28. Then came problems on the exchange rate front. The volatility of key exchange rates  particularly that of the yen against the US dollar  has placed the balance of payments of some Asian economies under considerable stress. For instance  since most Asian currencies are explicitly or implicitly linked to the US dollar  the appreciation of the US dollar severely squeezed the exporters  who have to compete with their rivals in Japan and the emerging economies in other parts of the world. The weakness of the yen revived Japanese exports  placing Japan in direct competition with its major trading partners in Asia  as the cheaper yen stimulated exports of Japanese durable goods and capital goods to Asia  while reducing imports from the region. It did not make sense to export out of the subsidiaries in ASEAN when it was cheaper to buy directly from the plant in Japan. The weaker yen also has a tendency to slow foreign direct investment from Japan  as it is no longer so expensive to produce in Japan. 29. As we are all aware  this combination of Asian monetary problems has recently put tremendous pressure on the financial markets  in particular the foreign exchange markets  in the region. This was compounded by speculators who took advantage of these market developments to set up their attacks  resulting in the currency turmoil in Asian currencies that we have seen. 30. Here I cannot possibly resist the temptation to offer a few comments. There is a common perception that the adoption of more flexible exchange rate regimes by a number of Asian economies implied a failure of fixed exchange rate systems. This is in my view a mistaken perception. As all central bankers are aware  there is no one perfect exchange rate regime. One of the dilemmas of any exchange rate regime is how the exchange rate can reflect the underlying economic conditions  which are constantly changing  so that external balance can be achieved. A fixed exchange rate regime can function well if there is strict financial and fiscal discipline  and flexibility of domestic goods and services markets to adjust for any structural changes in the economy. On the other hand  a flexible exchange rate regime can also work  provided that the policy package is correct and there is a well functioning foreign exchange and financial market. But it would be a mistake to think devaluation can substitute for fundamental policy adjustments to correct a structural external imbalance. Competitive devaluations are “beggar-thy-neighbour” policies that are self defeating. 31. Indeed  the adoption of more flexible exchange rate systems by some Asian economies has not meant they can avoid the adjustments that are currently being undertaken. With a fixed exchange rate under a very strong and disciplined regime in the form of a currency board system  Hong Kong focused precisely on our underlying productivity  maintaining strict financial and fiscal discipline  and also prudent banking supervision  in order to enhance the resilience of the linked exchange rate system  and minimize and manage the downside risks of overheating in the economy. 32. Let me also put the currency adjustments in their proper perspective. In the last few years  the currencies with the greatest adjustments and volatility have been the G-3 currencies  rather than the Asian currencies. The yen has depreciated by 50% against the US dollar from its peak in 1995. The deutschemark has likewise fallen by over 30%. In comparison  the Asian currencies have until recently remained relatively stable. The Hong Kong dollar has been the most stable of BIS Review 91/1997 - 7 - Asian currencies  moving less than 1% against the US dollar. It is the greater volatility of G-3 currencies that ultimately contributed to  if not caused  the volatility in smaller regional currencies. 33. There is yet another Asian monetary problem and this is one of a different nature. It concerns the effectiveness of financial intermediation in this region. Asia needs substantial investments in the economic infrastructure to prevent bottlenecks from hindering sustained growth. The World Bank has estimated that for East Asia alone  projected infrastructure investments amount to US$1.5 trillion between 1995-2004. If other forms of capital investment are included  the figure rises to a staggering $8 trillion. At the same time  Asian economies also have very high savings rates  some as high as 30% to 50%. The aging population in Northern Asia  for example  will be ploughing increasing savings into institutionalized retirement funds  which are risk-averse and would need to be invested in markets generating  other things being equal  higher returns  lower risks and greater liquidity. Japan  for example  has an estimated ¥1200 trillion outstanding in private savings that must be invested. When the Hong Kong Mandatory Provident Fund comes into operation by the year 2000  about 4% of Hong Kong’s GDP would be added annually to institutional investments. But the question is why Asian savings do not seem to have been adequately and effectively channeled into Asian investments in a manner more conducive to ensuring monetary and financial stability. 34. Much of Asian savings  in particular official sector savings and private sector savings that have been institutionalized  are still invested in assets of OECD countries  although the trend has been a gradually falling one. I cannot speak for other economies  but insofar as Hong Kong is concerned  in excess of 95% of our US$85 billion of foreign reserves are invested outside Asia. Specifically  in the management of our foreign reserves  we work against a preferred neutral position of about 75% in US dollar assets  mostly in US Treasury securities. I understand also that more than 80% of total Asian foreign exchange reserves amounting to US$600 billion are invested largely in North America and Europe. At the same time  there has been much foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment from OECD countries in Asia. It can be argued therefore that Asia is financing much of the budget deficits of developed economies  particularly the United States  but has to try hard to attract money back into the region through foreign investments. And the volatility of foreign portfolio investments has been a major cause of disruptions to the monetary and financial systems of the Asian economies. Some have even gone as far as to say that the Asian economies are providing the funding to hedge funds in non-Asian centres to play havoc with their currencies and financial markets. 35. This comment is perhaps a little unkind  given the important role that is being played by the international financial community in the globalized financial environment. But there certainly is a problem with the effectiveness of financial intermediation in this region which is inhibiting the flow of long-term savings into long-term investments. I believe an important factor behind this is the perceived or actual risks inherent in dealing with the products  the intermediaries and the market that are part of the process of financial intermediation. I also believe that monetary authorities have a responsibility  through concerted efforts in prudential regulation and supervision  and the development of the financial infrastructure  to contain these risks to levels more acceptable to those concerned  including themselves as managers of official foreign reserves. The Case for Asian Monetary Co-operation 36. These Asian monetary problems which I have described can seriously undermine the ability of Asian monetary authorities to deal with shocks  and so when shocks do come they will cause much agony in terms of economic disruptions and painful adjustments. The problems are also highly contagious  transmitted through sudden shifts in the same direction in the perception of risks by international investors  as they looked for worrisome similarities amongst Asian economies  as the recent turmoil in Asian currency markets has shown. The fall in one market may also lead them to look for liquidity in other markets  thus contributing further to the contagion. BIS Review 91/1997 - 8 - 37. We are living in an ever more interdependent region. Increasing trade and investment flows  made possible by trade and financial market liberalization  have bound our fates together. A decade ago  we relied heavily on markets outside Asia for our products  sending over three-quarters of exports to those markets. That reliance has been reduced sharply. In 1996  around 35% of trade in East Asia was conducted within the region  compared with the share of 28% with NAFTA countries and 20% with the European Union. 38. On investment and capital flows  the story is similar. As recently as in 1989  equity flows within the Asian region amounted to only US$24 billion. In 1995  the flows had increased three-fold to almost US$80 billion. According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  the share of foreign direct investment from North America and the European Union in East Asia had fallen from 40% of the total fifteen years ago to 25% by 1993. Now over 50% of foreign direct investment comes from within the region. This trend can only grow  as the population giants of China and India increasingly become more engaged in trade and investment (see Table 5). 39. Much greater interdependence of course means that policies in one economy can have important implications for others. A more liberalized financial environment also means that policy mistakes can be punished almost instantaneously by the market and that monetary problems in one economy can easily spread to others. So  referring again to one of the purposes of the IMF  as defined in its Articles of Agreement  there is a clear need “to promote international monetary co-operation” through “consultation and collaboration” on these “international monetary problems” that we now face in the Asian region. The Way Forward 40. I would like now to spell out how I think monetary co-operation in this region should proceed. In order to have effective monetary co-operation  we must have clearly defined and realistic goals. Over-ambitious goals may not be credible  and may even be counterproductive. In any case  they may not be politically acceptable to the individual economies. Monetary co-operation  and indeed any type of co-operation  is meaningless when you do not have common goals. 41. Notwithstanding increasing economic integration  one has to accept reality  and this is that the economies in Asia are a very diverse group. There are dramatic differences with regard to political institutions  economic systems  basic infrastructure and any aspect you care to think of. In terms of economic structure  for example  they range from some of the largest agricultural economies in the world to the most urban economies. In terms of economic philosophy  they range from some of the freest economies in the world to economies where there is considerable central planning. In terms of the stage of economic development  they range from economies with the highest per capita incomes to those still with a large part of their population living in poverty. In terms of financial sector development  they range from sophisticated international financial centres with deep financial markets and robust financial infrastructures to those which have just begun building their financial systems. 42. Reflecting such diversity  there are also dramatic differences in policies  in terms of the objectives pursued and the approaches to achieving those objectives. Focusing specifically on monetary policy  although there seems to be a clear consensus on the desirability of maintaining currency stability  there is great diversity on the degree of clarity with which this is defined. For some  currency stability is what the government thinks is politically expedient at the time. For others  currency stability is defined in the clearest of terms. Associated with this  there is also great diversity in the degree of independence of the monetary authorities and the degree of discretion available to them arising from the different monetary or exchange rate regimes practised. Nothing can be more polar than  for example  the currency board version of a fixed exchange regime in Hong Kong and BIS Review 91/1997 - 9 - the totally free float of New Zealand. Given differences in the economic and financial structure on the one hand  and differences in policy objectives and approaches on the other  the monetary transmission mechanism of Asian economies and their monetary reactions to internal and external shocks are also quite different. 43. How then should Asian economies pursue Asian monetary co-operation? The extent of the diversity of economies in Asia points quite clearly to one conclusion and this is that monetary integration is inappropriate  at least for the time being. One can perhaps get a better appreciation of this argument by attempting to apply the Maastricht criteria for European monetary union to Asia. Thus realistically Asian monetary co-operation will have to be pursued under a multi-currency environment. Asian monetary co-operation is not about monetary integration. The situation argues for monetary segregation  even to the extent  in the case of China  of maintaining two currencies in one country: the Renminbi for the Mainland of China and the Hong Kong dollar for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Again apply the Maastricht criteria to the Mainland of China and Hong Kong and you will come quickly to the conclusion that the “one country  two currencies” arrangement is a sensible one. It is essential if Hong Kong is to continue to be stable and prosperous as an international financial centre  as provided for in the Basic Law of Hong Kong. 44. Moving along the spectrum for monetary co-operation from the extreme end of monetary integration  we could consider whether some form of monetary policy co-ordination in Asia is appropriate. So far  however  there seems to be a lack of interest amongst monetary authorities in Asia in promoting this. Perhaps there has been no such need identified. Monetary sovereignty has been carefully guarded in this region. There is also concern  I suppose  on the likelihood of dominance in such co-ordination by the more influential economies in terms of size and financial clout. There has therefore been no attempt to identify the pros and cons of monetary policy co-ordination in Asia. The subject has not even featured in any of the discussions amongst the regional central bank groups that I know of. But one must of course keep an open mind on the subject. The contagious turmoil in the currencies and financial markets of Asia will I am sure stimulate some interest in it. Without pre-judging the outcome  I expect some initiative in putting the matter on the agenda for future discussions amongst monetary authorities in the region. 45. By contrast  there is a great deal of enthusiasm amongst monetary authorities of the region to promote Asian monetary co-operation when this does not inhibit the freedom to determine domestic policies. I am sure for example that we would be keen to talk to each other about how to strengthen our monetary defensive mechanisms against attacks on our currencies  and how to enhance the pain tolerance level of our financial systems so that we can absorb financial shocks more effectively. There is also considerable interest in building more robust financial infrastructures on the one hand to facilitate effective financial intermediation and on the other hand to limit the contagion effect of financial crises domestically and on a regional basis. I believe that this is a sensible way forward  at least for the time being. At the EMEAP forum  monetary authorities have  as I mentioned earlier  examined the whole spectrum of central banking functions quite comprehensively and have identified issues where monetary co-operation would be beneficial. 46. Before going into these issues  let me just make two points about the approach that should be adopted in Asian monetary co-operation. First is that Asian monetary co-operation must be considered within the context of global monetary co-operation. In other words  we should not  and I believe we are not trying to  build Fortress Asia. I do not believe that this is in the best interest of Asia. It is essential that we work within the international monetary and institutional framework as much as possible. Let us not forget that the international monetary order is still largely determined by the G-3 currencies. Asian economies cannot on their own  or without the help of others  determine the fate of the G-3 currencies  even though we may have views about the future system. BIS Review 91/1997 - 10 - 47. Second is that  given the great diversity of the economies in the region  being at very different stages of financial development  Asian monetary co-operation should proceed with flexibility and at a pace comfortable to those wishing to take part in it. It would be pragmatic to build monetary co-operation and establish links  perhaps first at the bilateral level  between those who are ready and willing  and are operating compatible systems: for example  bilateral repurchase agreements of US Treasury securities to enhance each other’s liquidity of foreign reserves  or bilateral linkages of real time payment systems and clearing systems for securities to facilitate effective financial intermediation across the cooperating economies. These bilateral linkages would serve to set targets and standards for others in the region who are not quite ready. And when eventually the majority of the bilateral linkages have been established  we would then have a network  an Asian monetary network  of considerable strength  which would hopefully enable Asian monetary problems to be tackled effectively. It should also be a network that is capable of being linked up with monetary systems outside the region  with a view to building the global monetary framework. Issues for Asian Monetary Co-operation 48. Let me now turn to specific issues for Asian monetary co-operation. There are five areas. These are information exchange  resource provision  market infrastructure development  banking supervision and financial regulation  and policy consultations. 49. As the experience of EMEAP has shown  information exchange has been the easiest area of monetary co-operation. The use of the EMEAP Virtual Secretariat  using Internet technology  has greatly facilitated the exchange of information  helping the sharing of market intelligence  techniques and experience in all areas of central banking. The benefits are quite evident and I will not therefore dwell on this issue other than to mention the need perhaps to consider the removal of legal or other inhibitions to information exchange and sharing amongst central banks. Confidentiality provisions in domestic legislation may need to be suitably adapted in this context. 50. Let me quickly turn to resource provision. Here we can distinguish between the provision of liquidity and the provision of credit. On the provision of liquidity  I have mentioned the network of bilateral repurchase agreements of US Treasury securities amongst EMEAP central banks. But  as has been pointed out  the contagious nature of Asian monetary problems is such that when one of us is short of liquid foreign reserves  others may be in the same boat. It may be beneficial therefore if the network could be cast wider  involving possibly non-Asian economies also holding substantial foreign reserves in US Treasuries. There is of course the New York Fed itself  as the custodian of the paper and the settlement agency of US dollar cash balances  which could play a supportive role in providing the service required. Yet another possibility is for the network of bilateral repurchase agreements to be multilateralized into a much more liquid pool  which could further be institutionalized so as also to facilitate  perhaps with leveraged arrangements  monetary co-operation through the provision of credit. 51. Asian monetary co-operation took quite a significant step forward when the financial package for Thailand organized by the IMF was met with ready willingness by a number of Asian economies  including ourselves. This I believe is the first significant arrangement involving Asian monetary co-operation through the provision of credit. As an international financial centre and an economy with significant interest in the Asian region  Hong Kong is willing to play its part in helping to maintain international and regional financial stability. This is ultimately in our own interest. This accounts for our willingness to join the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) to provide additional funding for the IMF. But the credit risks must be acceptable and manageable  and the case justifiable to the public in the overall public interest. Asian monetary co-operation through the provision of credit should therefore be on a multilateral basis and conditional upon the implementation of credible structural adjustment programmes. BIS Review 91/1997 - 11 - 52. At this point  we may well ask whether the present multilateral arrangements to handle international financial crises are totally satisfactory. It has been argued that economies in need should go earlier to the IMF for assistance. However  given the tough medicine that the Fund is well known to prescribe  there may have been a reluctance to approach the Fund  given also the limited resources available for a cure  thus delaying the whole process of crisis prevention and damage control. While the Thai package showed how neighbours are willing to help supplement Fund resources  this has the tendency to reinforce regional arrangements rather than dealing with the issue on a global basis. 53. We hope that a precedent has not been set that  if the Mexican crisis was an American problem  the Thai crisis an Asian one  the next case will be for whichever region to resolve. Such regionalism does not auger well for international monetary co-operation. We feel therefore that the resources of the Fund should be strengthened considerably and access level reviewed in the light of recent developments. This also applies to monitoring and enforcement efforts by the Fund. It would clearly not be efficient for regional groupings to duplicate the role of the existing international organizations such as the IMF and the BIS  with recognized expertise and the machinery to deal with these issues. In any case  a regional crisis is quite often not limited geographically  but has global ramifications. In dealing with a crisis  the Fund should also have the mechanism and authority in place to negotiate with private sector lenders to ensure that equitable burden sharing remains  and that the burden of adjustment does not fall only on official creditors. 54. Another important area for Asian monetary co-operation is the building of the market infrastructure. In trying to draw attention to this area  I have often said that while billions of dollars are spent in building highways and airports as part of the physical infrastructure  in order to move people around efficiently and safely  there is by comparison very little money spent in building the financial highways and airports to move money around efficiently and safely. As a result  the money does not move  at least not as much as one would like to see. Consequently  effective financial intermediation domestically and across economies in the region is inhibited  notwithstanding the rather attractive returns offered by the prosperity of this region. Financial markets remain fragmented along with geographical fragmentation of the region  and there is a lack of liquidity because the regional critical mass has not yet been formed. 55. Another common complaint about Asian financial markets is the inefficiency of settlement and clearing processes for money and financial products. As a result  the tendency is for many of the Asian economies to make use of established clearing and settlement systems in Europe and America. For example  Asian trading of Euro-yen paper has to be cleared and settled in European time. There is of course no logical answer to the question why trading of Asian paper by Asians cannot be settled and cleared in Asian time. I am often reminded that the Eurodollar and Eurobond market took off when Euroclear was established in the late 1960s. Furthermore  technology has now improved to the extent that we do not really need centralized clearing and settlement systems. I have long supported the concept of Asiaclear as a network of linkages of domestic clearing  settlement and depository systems. 56. Again  we in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority made a start in building this network through establishing bilateral linkages between our clearing system for debt securities called CMU and other systems. Our system is now linked up with Euroclear and Cedel  and we are working on linkages with corresponding systems in Australia  New Zealand and the Mainland of China. Once the matrix of bilateral linkages is filled up  the network of Asiaclear would be formed  like the Internet. There is no need for a centralized system or even a location. There is no centre for that network and so we do not need to get into the politically difficult question of where the network should be headquartered. We have also expressed our interest to other central banks in the region to establish similar linkages of payment systems. Our payment system in Hong Kong is already on the BIS Review 91/1997 - 12 - real time gross settlement (RTGS) mode. Others are proceeding with building their RTGS systems and as soon as they are ready we are happy again to work on establishing bilateral linkages to facilitate risk management of large value financial transactions across the two monetary systems. Once linked up  Herstatt risk of foreign exchange transactions involving the two currencies concerned will immediately be eliminated. Payment versus payment (PvP) and delivery versus payment (DvP) within Asian time will become a reality. 57. The fourth area for Asian monetary co-operation is banking supervision and financial regulation. As financial markets are further liberalized and integrated  the growth of cross-border banking activities and other financial transactions is accelerating  increasing the risk of contagion. As ultimately monetary problems surface in the banking system  it is important for regulators in different economies to co-operate to safeguard the integrity of the banking and financial systems in the region. Part of the work will involve the harmonization of supervisory practices  including the adoption of the Core Principles for effective supervision advocated by the Basle Committee. 58. Through working closer together  such as the collaboration of the EMEAP Study Group on Banking Supervision  supervisory authorities in the region would be able to improve their understanding of each others’ banking systems and supervision framework and approach. We will also review practices in the region against the existing Basle Committee benchmarks  identify reasons for any differences and thus help to raise the quality of supervision in the region. Over time  it may be possible to move on to the setting of standards. 59. Last  but not least  in Asia monetary co-operation concerns policy consultation. Clearly  there is scope to improve mutual understanding of each other’s policy framework and priorities. This may or may not be a prelude to policy co-ordination  as the case has not yet been established. But a regular channel of communication on policy issues is still needed. The EMEAP forum is a good start  but needs to be strengthened. The IMF and the BIS have demonstrated how closer relations and deeper appreciation of the issues can only be fostered through a system of formal and informal channels of communications and regular discussions. Such discussions not only promote appreciation of the issues facing individual economies  but also regional and international matters. We look forward to their playing a more significant role in this region. Conclusion 60. Ladies and gentlemen  the road to international monetary co-operation has never been straight and smooth. The European experience suggests that there are many bumps along the way. With much more diverse needs and perspectives in Asia  we must allow Asian monetary co-operation to take shape gradually and in a flexible way  starting with less ambitious goals and proceed at a pace and with arrangements comfortable to all. I believe the approach of building an Asian monetary network capable of further linkages to form a global monetary network is the correct one. It is based on voluntary participation and accommodates each participant’s unique circumstances. We do not have the visionaries of Europe that saw the need for a single currency  nor do we believe that a single global institution would be adequate in providing solutions to all Asian monetary problems. In the Asian pragmatic and patient way  and using the wise words of the late Deng Xiaoping  we cross the river by groping for the stones. I am confident that in the end  we will be able to build a robust and efficient Asian monetary network that would contribute to monetary and financial stability  and economic prosperity in Asia  and in turn contribute to global financial stability and prosperity. 61. I cannot end this lecture without paying tribute to the tremendous support and co-operation that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has received since its formation only four and a half years ago. I want specifically to acknowledge the unstinting support of the People’s Bank of BIS Review 91/1997 - 13 - China and the Bank of England. Without their guidance the Hong Kong Monetary Authority would not have become a reality. The Bank of Japan  the Bundesbank and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have also been generous in their support when we went around the international financial centres to explain the unique concept and practice of “one country  two systems”. All our fellow central banks and monetary authorities in EMEAP  SEANZA  and BIS showed us great kindness and support during the sensitive transitional period to the resumption of sovereignty by China in 1997. Indeed  the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is itself the fruit of monetary co-operation. 62. When asked what comes after 1997  we used to give the very simple reply: what comes after 1997 must be 1998. As you can see for yourself  with goodwill and co-operation  the prosperity of Hong Kong has been ensured  both before and after the resumption of sovereignty to China. You have my assurance  and the assurance of China  that Hong Kong will continue to play its role as an international financial centre. We will work hand in hand with all central bankers around the world to build a safer and more robust international monetary system. Thank you. BIS Review 91/1997

Brash  to the Rotary Club in Auckland  on 6/10/97.,Mr. Brash asks how fast the New Zealand economy can grow Address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand  Mr. Donald T. Brash  to the Rotary Club in Auckland  on 6/10/97. Introduction: economic growth is important Ladies and gentlemen  I am delighted to be addressing the Auckland Rotary Club today. Just 15 years ago I was a member of this Club  and I look back to that time with very warm memories. When I was invited to speak to you  I was given a clean slate: I was essentially allowed to choose my own subject. And I want to use that freedom to go beyond my usual territory  of monetary policy  interest rates  exchanges rates  MCIs and all the rest  to talk about a broader issue  namely New Zealand’s future economic growth -- what it may be  what is constraining it  and how it can be enhanced. And I want to do that for two reasons. First  because economic growth is the ultimate objective of much public policy  and that in turn because it is economic growth which gives us choices -- the ability to enjoy better quality housing  the ability to have better health care  the option of choosing more leisure  the ability to invest in environmentally-friendly production techniques  the freedom to choose between an array of options denied to those where economic growth is low or non-existent. And secondly I want to talk about economic growth because there is still a great deal of public misunderstanding about the role of the Reserve Bank and monetary policy in encouraging or discouraging economic growth. There is still quite a widespread view that the Reserve Bank’s exclusive focus on delivering predictably low inflation involves a cost in economic growth  and that if only the Bank were not so obsessive about its inflation objective the New Zealand economy could grow much more quickly. People look back to the 5  6 and 7 percent growth rates achieved just a few years ago  and wonder why we can’t return to those growth rates. They look at our Asian neighbours expanding with breathtaking speed  and wonder why we can’t emulate them. They reflect on the painful restructuring that the New Zealand economy underwent from 1984  and ask if it was all worthwhile. Some people suspect that perhaps the Reserve Bank has denied us the benefits which should have been available. So today I want to discuss the issue of economic growth in the broadest terms. My aim is to provide a framework for thinking about what is a reasonable expectation for New Zealand’s growth  to identify some of the factors that will determine whether we are able to achieve that potential  and to discuss the linkage between growth and the Reserve Bank’s interest  namely inflation. Running the economy is like running a marathon Let me start by reminding you of the challenge facing a marathon runner. The objective is to go as fast as possible over the full distance. It makes no sense to sprint  ‘hit the wall’  and simply not finish the race  or spend much of the time on hands and knees recovering from that initial bout of excessive enthusiasm. Nor does it make any sense to walk most of the way  finishing the race with unused reserves of energy. Neither approach is likely to lead to running the race in a personal best time. And that is why experienced athletes constantly check their pace  making sure it is neither too fast nor too slow. BIS Review 92/1997 - 2 - In terms of an economy  going too fast also leads to ‘hitting the wall’  with symptoms typically being a burst of inflation  a deterioration in the balance of payments position  perhaps an asset price boom  signs of difficulty in finding skilled employees  and very often a sense of euphoria (‘look how fast I’m going and I still feel good!’). The results of hitting the wall are typically a sharp recession -- sharper still if overcooked asset prices are collapsing. To complete the analogy  in any long distance race you will find several runners who have paced themselves correctly  but who complete the race in very different times. Each may have done a personal best time  but those personal bests will be very different. So it is with economies. Some economies will be able to sustain a much faster pace than others without running into the too-fast danger territory; some will naturally grow more slowly than others  without leaving large amounts of unused energy or potential. And it is not necessarily a question of one economy being better than another; it’s just a question of being different. If that thought surprises  I’d simply note that the ‘best’  most highly productive  economy in the world -- the United States -- is also one of the slower growing economies  and has been now for some decades. What is it that determines why some economies can achieve sustainably faster growth than others? Potential growth ultimately depends on two things: quantity and quality. The quantity of people and capital  in the form of factories  forests  trucks  roads  and all the rest. And the quality of those same things. Countries that have faster potential growth rates have faster trend growth in the quantity of people and capital at work in the economy  and/or faster trend growth in the quality or productivity of those things. New Zealand’s sustainable growth now about 3 percent annually So how fast can New Zealand grow in a sustainable  or ‘long-term average’  sense? Looking forward  we estimate New Zealand’s potential growth rate currently to be around 3 percent annually -- a result of trend growth in the working age population of 1.5 percent and trend growth in output per person also of about 1.5 percent. That growth in real output per person comes from a combination of growth in the quantity of capital  and growth in the quality of that capital and the way we use it. In other words  we should expect our growth rate to average about 3 percent annually over the course of our usual economic cycles  with outcomes for any given year ranging from about 1 percent at the trough to  perhaps  4 or 5 percent at the peak. If a 3 percent average growth rate does not sound very exciting  let’s put that into a broader context. Sustained growth of 3 percent is clearly well ahead of our experience in the seventies and eighties. Indeed  between 1975 and 1990  growth averaged less than 1 percent annually. Of course occasionally we grew more quickly than that  but those periods of faster growth were typically short-lived  and associated with unsustainably large fiscal and balance of payments deficits and rapidly increasing inflationary pressures. And the difference between a 1 percent average growth rate and a 3 percent average growth rate adds up to an enormous difference in the volume of goods and services available to New Zealanders if the difference is sustained for  say  10 years. Today  our economy is producing goods and services totalling about $100 billion each year. If that total grows by only 1 percent a year for a decade  in 10 years’ time we will be producing goods and services of $110 billion. If the total grows at an average of 3 percent a year  in 10 years’ time we will be producing goods and services of $134 billion. The difference of $24 billion annually is a BIS Review 92/1997 - 3 - lot of additional hospital operations  or tertiary education  or restaurant meals  or overseas holidays. But what about the much more rapid growth of the 1993 to 1995 period  during which at one point growth exceeded 7 percent? Surely that shows that we are capable of much faster growth than 3 percent? Clearly we can grow faster than 3 percent at times  and we are likely to do so  just as the marathon runner can occasionally sprint. Equally clearly  however  growing at 5  6  or 7 percent for a brief period tells us nothing about how fast we can grow on average over a longer period of time. The rapid growth which we experienced for a brief period in the 1993 to 1995 period was the result in part of adding more capital and of improving productivity  but was fundamentally the result of being able to bring back into employment the large number of people who had become unemployed during the recession of the late eighties and early nineties. You will recall that unemployment reached 11 percent of the labour force in the early nineties  and fell to 6 percent by the mid-nineties. Everybody hopes that unemployment falls below its present level  of almost 7 percent of the labour force. Growth rates aside  lower unemployment implies a huge improvement in well-being  both for the individuals concerned and for society as a whole. It is conceivable  although unlikely during the next two or three years  that we could reduce unemployment by 5 percent of the labour force again. But it is clearly inconceivable that we can do that repeatedly  since that would quickly imply negative unemployment. To the extent that the very rapid growth of the mid-nineties was a result of being able to ‘mine’ the unemployment rolls for additional workers  it is not something which can be repeated indefinitely. 3 percent growth looks good by the standards of other developed countries If we look at other countries  we find that  by the standards of the developed world  our 3 percent looks reasonably attractive. For example  the United States is generally estimated to have a growth potential of a little over 2 percent  being 1 percent labour force growth  and 1 percent annual productivity gain. Over recent months  some US commentators have wondered whether the US productivity trend has lifted -- largely as a consequence of the impact of new computer technology -- but the jury is still out on this question. Certainly the fact that US unemployment has recently been falling markedly  and now stands at 4.9 percent  its lowest level in nearly a quarter of a century  strongly suggests that recent US growth has also been dependent on ‘mining’ the unemployment rolls for additional workers  and is likely to slow as finding additional workers becomes increasingly difficult. It is also interesting to recall that  while some people have questioned why New Zealand can not achieve US growth rates  over the six years to March 1997 New Zealand grew at an average rate of 3.1 percent annually  slightly faster than the US economy grew over the same period (2.7 percent). Mr Ian Macfarlane  Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia  noted in a recent speech that  between June 1991 and December 1996  both New Zealand and Australia had enjoyed economic growth of 3.6 percent  and that that growth had been faster than growth in any of the other 16 developed countries against which he compared us  with the exception of BIS Review 92/1997 - 4 - Norway and Ireland. (Speech to the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce in Melbourne on 15 May 1997.) In other words  although it is too early to be dogmatic -- given the influence of cyclical factors on growth rates measured over relatively short periods -- New Zealand does appear to have made a significant gain in its growth potential in recent years  and to have lifted its performance from near the bottom of the class to somewhere rather closer to the top of the class of developed countries. Why do the Asian Tigers seem so much more successful? So where do the Asian Tigers fit in -- countries that have been routinely achieving growth rates of 8 to 10 percent per annum -- and why can’t New Zealand be more like them? That’s a question that has challenged economists around the world for some time. It would be misleading to claim that any sort of consensus has been arrived at -- indeed  the debate on the sources of these extraordinary growth rates still rages. But it seems likely that the very rapid growth achieved by the Asian Tiger economies  and by China  can be explained very readily in conventional terms  by looking at growth in the inputs of labour and capital  and at productivity improvements. Thus demographics and migration trends are obviously important in determining how fast a labour force will grow. And Asian economies have experienced very rapid increases in their effective labour forces in recent years. Singapore  for example  almost doubled the proportion of its population engaged in the formal labour force between 1960 and 1990. That increase accounts for close to one-third of Singapore’s remarkable average growth rate of 8.5 percent over that period. Similarly  a few decades ago many Asian economies operated with little in the way of modern tools and machinery. In recent years  the growth in the quantity of capital has been huge. Annual investment in Singapore has consistently exceeded 30 percent of GDP  and rose to almost 50 percent at times during the seventies. Those very high rates of investment  and the ability of traditionally poor  often agricultural  economies to pick up  off the shelf  very much more productive technologies from other countries have in turn made it possible to achieve extremely rapid improvements in labour productivity. Thus for example  taking a peasant farmer employing a water buffalo and a wooden plough and giving him either a modern tractor and a plough  or a modern computerised lathe  is likely to see an extremely large increase in output per person. It seems clear that if a country has available some under-utilised labour  large amounts of capital and an ability to adopt the latest technology  perhaps through being open to foreign direct investment  it is possible to grow very quickly indeed during a ‘catch-up’ phase. But once a country reaches the developed country norms in terms of labour force participation rates  standards of education  and available technology  growth rates will also tend to slow to match the developed country norms. Japan seems to have undergone that transformation in recent years. After growing at a very rapid pace that enabled it to transform itself over the post-war period from a rather poor and war-devastated country to one having per capita incomes amongst the highest in the BIS Review 92/1997 - 5 - world  Japan’s growth rate over the past few years has been much closer to that of the ‘more established’ developed economies. Lessons for New Zealand: immigration policy  benefit policies  and education policy are all important What can we learn from this survey of growth in other countries that is relevant to New Zealand today? The most important lesson is that if we wish to lift our long term growth rate -- our sustainable average growth rate -- we have to look to those factors that are important determinants of long term growth  namely the quantity and quality of the labour force  the quantity and quality of investment  and the other factors which determine the productivity with which labour and capital are combined. The supply of labour is largely determined by population growth and the proportion of the population which is engaged in employment. We can influence population growth to some extent  by our policy on immigration. The experience of Australia  Canada and the United States -- indeed of New Zealand -- suggests that a well-considered immigration policy can have a significantly beneficial effect on an economy’s long-term growth rate not only by increasing the labour force but by bringing skills  market knowledge and capital. The proportion of the population engaged in formal employment (the participation rate) can be influenced by policy even more substantively. For example  pension and entitlement rules which impose very high effective tax rates on low income people contemplating staying in  or re-entering  the work force tend to reduce participation rates. This makes the current discussion about reforming the benefit system of direct relevance to potential growth. With an ageing population and sensible policies on retirement income  we can expect a greater proportion of the population to remain in work beyond the current retirement age and  with some evidence that people remain healthier  both physically and mentally  when they are employed  that is almost certainly something to be welcomed for reasons going well beyond potential growth rates. Moreover  we can probably expect the trend towards higher participation rates for women to continue  and this too will mean that the labour force is likely to grow rather more quickly in the years ahead than does the population generally. The quality of our labour force can also be influenced through public policy choices  but only slowly. It is abundantly clear that the process of economic development and growth goes hand in hand with enhanced educational standards. We in New Zealand once routinely listed ‘a well-educated labour force’ as one of the clearly identifiable strengths of our economy. We can no longer be so confident on that front. The capacity of today’s high school graduates to write grammatical English seems to be disappointing to a great many employers  while international studies comparing the ability of New Zealand students in mathematics and science with that of students in other countries suggest that we no longer have anything of which to be terribly proud. In the Third International Maths and Science study  New Zealand ranked 22nd out of 41 countries in science and 24th in maths. By contrast  the top four countries in maths were Singapore  South Korea  Japan  and Hong Kong  with Singapore  South Korea and Japan also occupying three of the top four positions in science. BIS Review 92/1997 - 6 - As a general proposition  those economies which have been out-performing us in terms of per capita growth have typically also been out-performing us in educational effort. Whether that is because those countries have better educational structures  or just have people who are more convinced of the crucial importance of a good education  I do not know. But the result is that the quality of their labour force is rapidly improving  whereas ours is improving rather more slowly. For the longer term  it may well be that the most important policy area relevant to improving our sustainable growth rate is education policy. The quality of management also matters  and in this regard I have no doubt that the opening up of the New Zealand economy during the last decade or so has been a catalyst for improved business management in New Zealand. Certainly poor management is no longer sheltered by regulations and tariffs which keep competitors at bay. Similarly  economies that grow strongly typically have good industrial relations. Here too we have made progress in recent years. The less centralised structures we now have for negotiating pay and conditions have been beneficial from the standpoint of encouraging both employers and employees to focus on their mutual stake in staying up with  if not ahead of  the competition. At the very least  nobody seems to want to go back to the very highly centralised industrial relations structures we had in the seventies and eighties. And the number of ‘days lost’ as the result of strikes is well down on what used to be regarded as normal. These things are all helping our growth performance. Lessons for New Zealand: policies which distort investment decisions damage our growth prospects Additional investment  so that each person employed is teamed with a greater amount of physical capital  is also crucial to our growth performance. But in some ways the quality of additional investment is even more important than its quantity. When we look at New Zealand’s slow growth period -- through the seventies and eighties -- we find that the ratio of investment to GDP was quite respectable by comparison with other developed countries. What was impeding growth was not so much an inadequate level of investment as a persistent tendency to direct capital into low-yielding activities. Perhaps the best-known examples of low-yielding investment were the ‘Think Big’ projects of the late seventies and early eighties  but a great many could also be found in the private sector. Partly because of the distortions caused by inflation  much investment was channelled into real estate investment  sometimes well ahead of demand. Partly because of subsidies  capital was invested in the production of sheepmeat for which there was no market. Largely because of quantitative import restrictions and high tariffs  a great deal of capital was invested in activities which  while profitable to the investors  added little or nothing to output valued at international prices. Worse  in some highly protected industries  when measured at international prices the value of output was actually negative. In other words  the cost of inputs  at world prices  exceeded the value of outputs at world prices. It is with those considerations in mind that countries seeking to boost their growth performance look to micro-economic reforms -- to reduced protection  to deregulation  to flatter and broader tax structures  and to increased market flexibility -- to encourage available resources of labour and capital to move into those activities where private financial returns and national economic returns are similarly high. BIS Review 92/1997 - 7 - With that  of course  goes the requirement that those same resources are permitted to move away from activities in which the returns are low. Allowing industries which depend for their continued existence on protection from imports to continue operating indefinitely may be doing a favour to the subsidised few  but it certainly does not help our growth potential. (It surprises me that we still hear  occasionally  a manufacturer argue that we should not reduce tariffs in New Zealand because other countries use tariffs to protect the internationally uncompetitive parts of their economies. Since tariffs are essentially a tax on exports  and our export industries are almost by definition those which are the most efficient in international terms  why we should tax such industries just because other countries tax their export industries is frankly beyond me.) Lessons for New Zealand: growth affected by high taxation? Attention is also increasingly focusing on the role which the total size of government plays in influencing an economy’s growth rate. In recent months  a series of studies commissioned by the Inland Revenue Department has reached the conclusion that when a government’s total tax revenue exceeds about 20 percent of GDP the impact on growth is negative. Another study commissioned by the Treasury has cast some doubt on the methodology used in the studies commissioned by the IRD  but suggests that the optimum level of taxation  relative to GDP and from a growth point of view  is probably below 20 percent. Why? Presumably because with low tax rates fewer resources are squandered in trying to minimise tax obligations  and the disincentive effects of taxation on effort and risk-taking are reduced. I myself do not know why countries with relatively low tax burdens appear to grow more quickly than those with relatively high tax burdens  or indeed whether there is any causal relationship between low tax levels and high growth. But it does seem clear that the East Asian countries where economic growth has recently been most rapid are also countries where the ratio of tax revenue to GDP is very much lower than it is in New Zealand or other developed economies. Lessons for New Zealand: growth remains heavily dependent on foreign savings One other issue deserves mention. Before a country can invest it must have access to savings -- either its own domestically-generated savings  or the savings of other countries. New Zealand has a long record of relying on the savings of others. That was hardly surprising when  as a colonial outpost  we drew on the capital of Britain to fund our development. We also relied on a flow of migrants to boost the available labour force. Together  those imported resources were combined to generate growth and wealth at a rate that was probably similar to that achieved by the Asian Tigers in the last decade or so. While the flow of migrants is generally rather smaller in modern New Zealand than was the case during the late nineteenth century  we’ve never fully weaned ourselves from a relatively heavy dependence on the savings of others. We appear to see nothing unusual  let alone undesirable  in continuing to do so indefinitely. It is not at all obvious that we would invest more  or would invest more efficiently  if we generated more savings domestically. But it seems to me  as someone who believes that our being open to international capital markets has been hugely beneficial to our economy and to our society  that we would probably face a more stable and perhaps more secure future if our dependence on the savings of others were reduced. At the very least  we need to BIS Review 92/1997 - 8 - recognise that there is little point in decrying the degree of foreign ownership of New Zealand businesses and assets if we are not also ready to decry the paucity of New Zealand savings. Growth and monetary policy So where does monetary policy fit into this growth story? It may surprise you to hear me contend that  as a determinant of long term growth potential  monetary policy has a relatively modest and indirect influence. I say that because  as I have explained  long term growth is a product of labour and capital  and how productively those two factors work together. The things which I have described as being crucial here are essentially ‘supply-side’ matters -- the rate of growth of the labour force  the quality of the education system  the extent to which government policies distort the allocation of investment  and all the rest. These are the crucial determinants of our sustainable growth rate. But monetary policy can help in two ways. First  by keeping inflation stable it can  as a by-product  assist in moderating economic cycles -- restraining demand when it threatens to exceed the economy’s capacity to supply and encouraging demand to increase when it threatens to fall short of capacity. In other words  successful monetary policy aimed at keeping inflation stable also keeps the economy’s pace as close to the optimum as possible. In the marathon analogy  successful monetary policy avoids the economy ‘hitting the wall’  but also avoids it ‘running too slowly’  with unused reserves of labour and capital. Secondly  there is now strong evidence that high inflation positively damages sustainable growth  and growing evidence that there is some damage caused even by quite low rates of inflation. Nobody argues that price stability will create a major improvement in an economy’s sustainable growth rate -- that growth rate depends primarily  as indicated  on all the real factors I have already discussed. But it now seems beyond reasonable doubt that keeping the general price level stable is the best contribution which monetary policy can make to the way in which the economy operates  and therefore the best contribution to the economy’s sustainable growth rate. In an inflation-free environment  investors and the public generally get their best shot at reading accurately the signals that markets are delivering -- which goods and services represent best value  where the best returns on investment may be found  how much to consume and how much to save. Price stability is not a sufficient condition for strong growth. It is not even a necessary condition for strong growth. It is just the best contribution which monetary policy can make.

It is always with mixed feelings of pleasure and trepidation that I accept an invitation to speak at the American Bankers Association annual convention. I still have a disconcerted remembrance of my acceptance of your first invitation  which had been scheduled for October 20  1987. That speech had to be scratched at the last minute as the result of a certain adversity in stock price adjustments the day before. Experience suggests  however  that history does not repeat with a fixed periodicity and  besides  I have crossed my fingers. The theme of your convention this year is timely. It is exactly when rapid innovation and institutional and technological change are taking place that market participants should take time to contemplate the opportunities and the risks  what to retain and what to change. Only then can the banking industry create the most value-added for customers  employees  and society  and as a consequence  for shareholders. As in recent years  the future role of banks and other providers of financial services will surely be significantly affected by the same basic forces that have shaped the real and financial economy world-wide: relentless technological change. This morning  I would like to describe some of the effects of technological change in both the financial and nonfinancial sectors and discuss a few of their more important implications. I will begin with the real economy. Technological Change and the Real Economy The most important single characteristic of the changes in U.S. technology in recent years is the ever expanding conceptualization of our Gross Domestic Product. We are witnessing the substitution of ideas for physical matter in the creation of economic value -- a shift from hardware to software  as it were. The roots of increasing conceptualization of output lie deep in human history  but the pace of such substitution probably picked up in the early stages of the industrial revolution  when science and machines created new leverage for human energy and ideas. Nonetheless  even as recently as the middle of this century  the symbols of American economic strength were our outputs of such physical products as steel  motor vehicles  and heavy machinery -- items for which sizable proportions of production costs reflected the exploitation of raw materials and the sheer manual labor required to manipulate them. However  today’s views of economic leadership focus increasingly on downsized  smaller  less palpable evidence of weight and bulk  requiring more technologically sophisticated labor input. Examples of this trend permeate our daily lives. Radios used to be activated by large vacuum tubes; today we have elegantly designed pocked-sized transistors to perform the same function -- but with the higher quality of sound and greater reliability that consumers now expect. Thin fiber optic cable has replaced huge tonnages of copper wire. Owing to advances in metallurgy  engineering  and architectural design  we now can construct buildings that enclose as much or more space with fewer materials. A number of commentators  particularly Professor Paul David of Stanford University  have suggested that  despite the benefits we have seen this decade  it may be that the truly significant increases in living standards resulting from the introduction of computers and BIS Review 92/1997 - 2 - communications equipment still lie ahead. If true  this would not be unusual. Past innovations  such as the introduction of the dynamo or the invention of the gasoline-powered motor  required considerable infrastructure investment before their full potential could be realized. Electricity  when it substituted for steam power late last century  was initially applied to production processes suited to steam. Gravity was used to move goods vertically in the steam environment  and that could not immediately change with the advent of electric power. It was only when horizontal factories  newly designed for optimal use of electric power  began to dominate our industrial system many years after electricity’s initial introduction  that national productivity clearly accelerated. Similarly  it was only when modern highways and gasoline service stations became extensive that the lower cost of motor vehicle transportation became evident. Technological Change and the Financial Economy It is surely not news to a group of bankers that the same forces that have been reshaping the real economy have also been transforming the financial services industry. Once again  perhaps the most profound development has been the rapid growth of computer and telecommunications technology. The advent of such technology has lowered the costs  reduced the risks  and broadened the scope of financial services  making it increasingly possible for borrowers and lenders to transact directly  and for a wide variety of financial products to be tailored for very specific purposes. As a result  competitive pressures in the financial services industry are probably greater than ever before. As is true in the real economy  it is difficult to overestimate the importance of education and ongoing training to the advancement of technology and product innovation in the financial sector. I doubt that I need to tell any of you about the importance of education and training for employees. But the same is almost surely true for your customers. Surveys repeatedly indicate that users of electronic banking products are typically very well educated. For example  data from the Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Consumer Finances suggest that a higher level of education significantly increases the chances that a household consumer will use an electronic banking product. Indeed  this survey indicates that  in late 1995  the median user of an electronic source of information for savings or borrowing decisions had a college degree -- a level of education currently achieved by less than one-third of American households. Technological innovation and more sophisticated users have accelerated the second major trend -- financial globalization -- which has been reshaping our financial system  not to mention the real economy  for at least three decades. Both developments have expanded cross-border asset holding  trading  and credit flows and  in response  both securities firms and U.S. and foreign banks have increased their cross-border operations. Once again  a critical result has been greatly increased competition both at home and abroad. A third development reshaping financial markets -- deregulation -- has been as much a reaction to technological change and globalization as an independent factor. Moreover  the continuing evolution of markets suggests that it will be literally impossible to maintain some of the remaining rules and regulations established for previous economic environments. While the ultimate public policy goals of economic growth and stability will remain unchanged  market forces will continue to make it impossible to sustain outdated restrictions  as we have recently seen with respect to interstate banking and branching. BIS Review 92/1997 - 3 - In such an environment  I share your frustration with the pace of legislative reform and revision to statutorily mandated regulations. Nonetheless  we should not lose sight of the remarkable degree of re-codification of law and regulation to make banking rules more consistent with market realities that has occurred in recent years. Deposit and other interest rate ceilings have been eliminated  geographical restrictions have been virtually removed  many banking organizations can do a fairly broadly based securities underwriting and dealing business  many can do insurance sales  and those with the resources and skill are authorized to virtually match foreign bank competition abroad. Moreover  it seems clear that there is recognition by the Congress that the basic financial framework has to be adjusted further. The process  as you know  is not easy when the results of regulatory relief create both a new competitive landscape and new supervisory and stability challenges. Change will  I believe  ultimately occur because the pressures unleashed by technology  globalization  and deregulation have inexorably eroded the traditional institutional differences among financial firms. Examples abound. Securities firms have for some time offered checking-like accounts linked to mutual funds  and their affiliates routinely extend significant credit directly to business. On the bank side  the economics of a typical bank loan syndication do not differ essentially from the economics of a best-efforts securities underwriting. Indeed  investment banks are themselves becoming increasingly important in the syndicated loan market. With regard to derivatives instruments  the expertise required to manage prudently the writing of over-the-counter derivatives  a business dominated by banks  is similar to that required for using exchange-traded futures and options  instruments used extensively by both commercial and investment banks. The writing of a put option by a bank is economically indistinguishable from the issuance of an insurance policy. The list could go on. It is sufficient to say that a strong case can be made that the evolution of financial technology alone has changed forever our ability to place commercial banking  investment banking  insurance underwriting  and insurance sales into neat separate boxes. Nonetheless  not all financial institutions would prosper as  nor desire to be  financial supermarkets. Many specialized providers of financial services are successful today and will be so in the future because of their advantages in specific areas. Moreover  especially at commercial banks  the demand for traditional services by smaller businesses and by households is likely to continue for some time. And the information revolution  while it has deprived banks of some of the traditional lending business with their best customers  has also benefitted banks by making it less costly for them to assess the credit and other risks of customers they previously would have shunned. Thus  it seems most likely that banks of all types will continue to engage in a substantial amount of traditional banking  delivered  of course  by ever improving technology. Community banks  in particular  are likely to provide loans and payments services via traditional on-balance sheet banking. Indeed  smaller banks have repeatedly demonstrated their ability to survive and prosper in the face of major technological and structural change by providing traditional banking services to their customers. The evidence is clear that well-managed smaller banks can and will exist side by side with larger banks  often maintaining or increasing local market share. Technological change has facilitated this process by providing smaller banks with low-cost access to new products and services. In short  the record shows that well-managed smaller banks have nothing to fear from technology  globalization  or deregulation. For all size entities  however  technological change is blurring not only traditional distinctions between the banking  securities  and insurance business  but is also having a BIS Review 92/1997 - 4 - profound effect on historical separations between financial and nonfinancial businesses. Most of us are aware of software companies interested in the financial services business  but some financial firms  leveraging off their own internal skills  are also seeking to produce software for third parties. Shipping companies’ tracking software lends itself to payment services. Manufacturers have financed their customers’ purchases for a long time  but now increasingly are using the resultant financial skills to finance noncustomers. Moreover  many nonbank financial institutions are now profitably engaged in nonfinancial activities. Current facts and expected future trends  in short  are creating market pressures to permit the common ownership of financial and nonfinancial firms. In my judgement  it is quite likely that in future years it will be close to impossible to distinguish where one type of activity ends and another begins. Nonetheless  it seems wise to move with caution in addressing the removal of the current legal barriers between commerce and banking  since the unrestricted association of banking and commerce would be a profound and surely irreversible structural change in the American economy. Were we fully confident of how emerging technologies would affect the evolution of our economic and financial structure  we could presumably develop today the regulations which would foster that evolution. But we are not  and history suggests we cannot  be confident of how our real and financial economies will evolve. If we act too quickly  we run the risk of locking in a set of inappropriate rules that could adversely alter the development of market structures. Our ability to foresee accurately the future implications of technologies and market developments in banking  as in other industries  has not been particularly impressive. As Professor Nathan Rosenberg of Stanford University has pointed out  “. . . mistaken forecasts of future structure litter our financial landscape.” Indeed  Professor Rosenberg suggests that even after an innovation’s technical feasibility has been clearly established  its ultimate effect on society is often highly unpredictable. He notes at least two sources of this uncertainty. First  the range of applications for a new technology may not be immediately apparent. For instance  Alexander Graham Bell initially viewed the telephone as solely a business instrument -- merely an enhancement of the telegraph -- for use in transmitting very specific messages  such as the terms of a contract. Indeed  he offered to sell his telephone patent to Western Union for only $100 000  but was turned down. Similarly  Marconi initially overlooked the radio’s value as a public broadcast medium  instead believing its principal application would be in the transmission of point-to-point messages  such as ship-to-ship  where communication by wire was infeasible. A second source of technological uncertainty reflects the possibility that an innovation’s full potential may be realized only after extensive improvements  or after complementary innovations in other fields of science. According to Charles Townes  a Nobel Prize winner for his work on the laser  the attorneys for Bell Labs initially refused  in the late 1960s  to patent the laser because they believed it had no applications in the field of telecommunications. Only in the 1980s  after extensive improvements in fiber optics technology  did the laser’s importance for telecommunications become apparent. It’s not hard to find examples of such uncertainties within the financial services industry. The evolution of the over-the-counter derivatives market over the past decade has been nothing less than spectacular. But as the theoretical underpinnings of financial arbitrage were being published in the academic journals in the late 1950s  few observers could have predicted how the scholars’ insights would eventually revolutionize global financial markets. Not only were additional theoretical and empirical research necessary  but  in addition  several generations BIS Review 92/1997 - 5 - of advances in computer and communications technologies were necessary to make these concepts computationally practicable. All these examples  and more  suggest  that if we dramatically change the rules now about banking and commerce  with what is great uncertainty about future synergies between finance and nonfinance  we may well end up doing more harm than good. And  as with all rule changes by government  we are likely to find it impossible to correct our errors promptly  if at all. Modifications of such a fundamental structural rule as the separation of banking and commerce accordingly should proceed at a deliberate pace in order to test the response of markets and technological innovations to the altered rules in the years ahead. The need for caution and humility with respect to our ability to predict the future is highly relevant for how banking supervision should evolve. As I proposed to this audience last year  regulators are beginning to understand that the supervision of a financial institution is  of necessity  a continually evolving process reflecting the continually changing financial landscape. Increasingly  supervisory techniques and requirements try to harness both the new technologies and market incentives to improve oversight while reducing regulatory burden  burdens that are becoming progressively obsolescent and counterproductive. Concerns about setting a potentially inappropriate regulatory standard were an important factor in the decision by the banking agencies several years ago not to incorporate interest rate risk and asset concentration risk into the formal risk-based capital standards. In the end  we became convinced that the technologies for measuring and managing interest rate risk and concentration risk were evolving so rapidly that any regulatory standard would quickly become outmoded or  worse  inhibit private market innovations. Largely for these reasons  ultimately we chose to address the relationship between these risks and capital adequacy through the supervisory process rather than through the writing of regulations. Conclusion In conclusion  it is clear that both the real and the financial economies have been  and will continue to be  changed dramatically by the forces of technological progress. Banks will be under constant challenge to harness these forces to meet the ever-shifting competition. In such an environment  many existing rules and regulations will  if not modified  increasingly bind those banks seeking to respond  let alone innovate. Thus  there is a profound need for legislators and banking supervisors also to adapt to the changing realities. But do keep in mind that the government has an obligation to limit systemic risk exposure  and centuries of experience teach us the critical role that financial stability plays in the stability of the real economy. Bankers also have an obligation to their shareholders and creditors to measure and manage risk appropriately. In short  the regulators and the industry both want the same things -- financial innovation  creative change  responsible risk-taking  and growth. The market forces at work will get us there  perhaps not as rapidly as some banks may desire  but get there we will. BIS Review 92/1997

Phillips in Washington  on 8/10/97.,Ms. Phillips' testimony before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the U.S. House of Representatives Testimony of a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  Ms. Susan M. Phillips in Washington  on 8/10/97. Madam Chairwoman and members of the Subcommittee  I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Federal Reserve’s efforts in recent years to strengthen its supervisory processes and also to share with you the Board’s views about what challenges lie ahead  both for the banking system and the supervisory process. As you know  the U.S. economy and its banking system have enjoyed half a decade of improving strength in which U.S. banks have become better capitalized and more profitable than they have been in generations. Moreover  in the past 13 months not a single insured bank has failed  and the Bank Insurance Fund is now capitalized at a level requiring most banks to pay only nominal fees for their insurance. While we can take comfort and  to some degree  satisfaction in these events  experience has demonstrated that at times like these -- if we are not vigilant -- risks can occur that set the stage for future problems. As I begin my remarks  I would like to point out that no system of supervision or regulation can provide total assurance that banking problems will not occur or that banks will not fail. Nor should it. Our goal as regulators is to identify weak banking practices early so that small or emerging problems can be addressed before they become large and costly -- either to the insurance fund or the financial system as a whole. We believe that progress made in recent years to focus our examinations on the areas of highest risk at banking organizations places us in a better position to identify problems early  control systemic risk  and maintain financial stability. That goal and the need to adapt the supervisory process to the potentially rapidly changing conditions in banking and financial markets underlies our decision to pursue a more risk-focused supervisory approach. We are well underway in implementing this new supervisory framework  and initial indications about that process from both the Federal Reserve’s supervisory staff and the banking industry  itself  have been favorable. The risk-focused approach reflects our supervisory response to the effects that technology and financial innovation have had on the pace of change in banking organizations  the nature of U.S. and world financial markets  and the techniques employed for managing and controlling risk. As banking practices and markets continue to evolve  our emphasis on risk-focused supervision will be even more necessary in the years to come. The Federal Reserve’s Oversight Role As the primary federal supervisor of U.S. bank holding companies  state member banks  and most U.S. offices of foreign banks  the Federal Reserve has sought to apply effective supervision and contain excessive risks to the federal safety net  while also ensuring that banks adequately serve their communities and accommodate economic growth. As the nation’s central bank  the Federal Reserve brings a different  important perspective to the supervisory process through its attention to the broad and long-term consequences of supervisory actions on the financial system and the economy. Significantly  the practical  hands-on involvement which the Federal Reserve gains through its supervisory function supports and complements our other central bank responsibilities  including fostering a safe and efficient payment system and ensuring the stability of the financial system. Past studies of bank failures have cited a number of contributing factors including  but certainly not limited to  inadequate supervisory staffing and antiquated examination procedures. Over the years  as it has supervised and regulated banking organizations  the Federal Reserve has emphasized periodic  on-site examinations that entail substantive loan portfolio reviews and significant transaction testing to identify emerging problems. In that connection  the Federal Reserve has sought to maintain a sufficient number and quality of supervisory personnel to conduct BIS Review 93/1997 - 2 - examinations with appropriate frequency and depth. That approach appears to have provided us with some consistent success. As conditions within the industry have substantially improved  the Board has been mindful of the cost of conducting its supervisory activities and has worked to contain those costs in the face of increased responsibilities. Throughout this period we have recognized the need to maintain stability in our work force  and have sought to avoid excessive build-ups or periods of disruptive retrenchment. That approach has enabled us to maintain what we believe has been an adequate and consistent level of oversight of banking organizations under our supervision during both good times and bad. Developments Driving Change During the past decade  the U.S. banking system has experienced a great deal of turmoil  stress  and change. Ten years ago  many of the country’s largest banks announced huge loan loss provisions  beginning the process of reducing the industry’s overhang of doubtful developing country loans. At the same time  many of these institutions and smaller regional banks were struggling with oil and agriculture sector difficulties or accumulating commercial real estate problems. These and other difficulties took a heavy toll. By the end of the 1980s  more than 200 banks were failing annually  and there were more than 1 000 other problem banks. This experience provided important lessons and forced supervisors and bankers  alike  to reconsider the way they approached their jobs. For their part  bankers recognized the need to build their capital and reserves  strengthen their internal controls  and improve practices for identifying  underwriting and managing risk. Supervisors were also reminded of the need to remain vigilant and of the high costs that bank failures can bring  not only to the insurance fund but to local communities as well. The FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 emphasized that point  requiring frequent examinations and prompt regulatory actions when serious problems emerge. Beyond these largely domestic  institutional events  banks and businesses throughout the world were dealing in the 1980s and 1990s with new technologies that were leading to a multitude of new and increasingly complex financial products that changed the nature of banking and financial markets. These technologies have brought many benefits that facilitate more efficient markets and  in turn  greater international trade and economic growth. They may also  however  have raised macro-stability concerns by concentrating the growing volume and complexity of certain activities within a small number of truly global institutions. It is essential that these largest firms adequately manage the related risks of these activities and that they remain adequately supervised. For it is these institutions that have the potential to disrupt worldwide payment systems and contribute most to systemic risk. In addition to the formal supervisory oversight exerted by regulators  concerns may be eased somewhat by the strong counterparty discipline being brought to bear world wide on banks and other financial institutions dealing in these new products. The scrutiny among counterparties in the global market place has contributed to improvements in capital positions and in overall risk management practices. In many ways  U.S. banks have been in the vanguard in applying technological advances to their products  distribution systems  and management processes  with such applications and innovations as ATMs  home banking  securitizations and credit derivatives. Such efforts  combined with greater attention to pricing their services and measuring their risks  have had material effects on the increased strength and profitability that our banks have seen. Within the United States  our banking system has also experienced a dramatic consolidation in the number of banking institutions  with the number of independent commercial BIS Review 93/1997 banking organizations declining from 12 400 in 1980 to 7 400 in June of this year.1 That structural change has also contributed to industry earnings by providing banks with greater opportunities to reduce costs. The challenge going forward for many of these institutions may be in managing the growth and the continuing process of industry consolidation. This challenge may be greatest as banking organizations expand  particularly through acquisitions  into more diverse or nontraditional banking activities. That growth into a wider array of activities is especially important if banks are to meet the wide-ranging needs of their business and household customers while competing effectively with other regulated and unregulated firms. However  the managerial implications of rapid growth and growth into new activities should not be overlooked  either by the institutions or their supervisors. Supervisory Challenges Ahead There is also no shortage of tasks facing the Federal Reserve as a bank supervisor  despite the virtually unprecedented strong condition of the U.S. banking system today. We  too  must deal with the evolving financial markets and advances in technology. At the same time  we must ensure that our own supervisory practices  tools  and standards take advantage of technological improvements and financial techniques so that our oversight is not only effective  but also as unobtrusive and appropriate as possible. These tasks are wide ranging  extending from our own re-engineering of the supervisory process to the way supervisors approach issues such as measuring capital adequacy and how we seek convergence on bank supervisory standards worldwide. Risk-focused examinations Constructing a sound supervisory process while minimizing regulatory burden has been a long-standing and on-going effort at the Federal Reserve and an objective we have sought to advance with our emphasis on risk-focused examinations. Particularly in the past decade  we have found that the increased range of products and the greater depth and liquidity of financial markets permit banking organizations to change their risk profiles more rapidly than ever before. That possibility requires that we strike an appropriate balance between evaluating the condition of an institution at a point in time and evaluating the soundness of the bank’s processes for managing risk. Recognition of the need for that balance is at the heart of the risk-focused examination approach. The risk-focused approach  by definition  entails a more formal risk assessment planning phase that identifies those areas and activities that warrant the most extensive review. This pre-planning process is supported by technology  for example  to download certain information about a bank’s loan portfolio to our own computer systems and target areas of the portfolio for review. Once on-site  examiners analyze the bank’s loans and other assets to ascertain the organization’s current condition  and also to evaluate its internal control process and its own ability to identify and resolve problems. As a result  the Federal Reserve is placing greater reliance than before on a bank’s internal auditors and on the accuracy and adequacy of its information systems. The review of the information flow extends from top to bottom  and with the expectation that bank senior management and boards of directors are actively involved in monitoring the bank’s activities and providing sufficient guidance regarding risk assumption. 1 “Independent commercial banking organizations” is defined as the sum of all bank holding companies and independent banks. Multi-bank holding companies are  therefore  considered as a single organization. BIS Review 93/1997 - 4 - As in the past  performance of substantive checks on the reliability of a bank’s controls remains today a cornerstone of the examination process  albeit in a more automated and advanced form. For example  automated loan sampling is performed for the purpose of generating statistically valid conclusions about the accuracy of a bank’s internal loan review process. To the extent we can validate the integrity of a bank’s internal controls more efficiently  we can place more confidence in them at an earlier stage and can also take greater comfort that management is getting an accurate indication of the bank’s condition. Toward that end  Board staff is working to refine loan-sampling procedures that should further boost examiner productivity and accomplish other supervisory goals. Moreover  as examiners are able to complete loan reviews more quickly  they will have more time to review other high-priority aspects of the institution’s operations. A significant benefit of the risk-focused approach is its emphasis on ensuring that the bank’s internal oversight processes are sound and that communication between the bank and senior examiners is ongoing between examinations. That approach is generally supported by institutions we supervise and provides a more comprehensive oversight process that complements our annual or 18-month examinations. Such an approach strengthens our ability to respond promptly if conditions deteriorate. Another benefit of the risk-focused approach has been a greater amount of planning  analysis  and information gathering at Reserve Banks prior to the on-site portion of the examination. Far from reducing our hands-on knowledge of the institution  this approach has ensured that when we are on-site  we are reviewing and analyzing the right areas  talking to the right people and making better use of our time and that of the bank’s management and employees. In addition to improving productivity  it has also reduced our travel costs and improved employee morale. Examination staff at the Reserve Banks indicate that this process may be reducing on-site examination time by 15-30 percent in many cases and overall examination time of Federal Reserve personnel by perhaps 10 percent. While those results are tentative  partial  and unscientific  they are certainly encouraging in terms of resource implications. Complementing the risk-focused approach to supervision are enhancements to the tools we use to grade a bank’s condition and management. Since 1995  we have asked Federal Reserve examiners to provide a specific supervisory rating for a bank’s risk management process. More recently  the CAMEL rating system  too  has been revised by the banking agencies to place more emphasis on the adequacy of a bank’s risk management practices and was expanded to include a specific “S” rating for an institution’s sensitivity to market risk. As you may know  the Federal Reserve has also  for some time  used a rating scheme that focuses heavily on managerial procedures and controls in its oversight of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. How effective is the risk-focused process? Since economic and industry conditions have been generally favorable for the past several years  there has not been a sufficiently stressful economic downturn to test fully bank risk management systems or supervisory practices. The market volatility beginning in 1994 did  however  provide some tests for the risk management systems of the larger banks with active trading desks. Nevertheless  there are many indications that bank and supervisory practices are materially better than they were in the 1980s and early 1990s. For example  the risk-focused approach is helping to identify certain deficiencies before they show up in a bank’s financial condition. These are evidenced by instances where ratings for the quality of bank management are lower than those for capital  asset quality  or earnings. Because managerial weaknesses eventually show up in a bank’s financial condition  it is important to identify and resolve those weaknesses early. In that regard  the risk-focused approach endeavors to prevent problems from developing to the point that they cause unnecessary losses that impair the institution’s capital and require resolution under the Prompt Corrective Action mandate. BIS Review 93/1997 One example of how the risk-focused approach is helping to identify and address deficiencies is our supervisory experience with the U.S. branches of foreign banks. Subsequent to the enactment of the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act of 1991  which gave the Federal Reserve greater supervisory authority over foreign branches  our examinations uncovered a number of entities with internal control and audit weaknesses. This result was not completely unexpected  as these foreign banking organizations were not previously subject to the same level of oversight as our domestic organizations. Recognizing the seriousness of these weaknesses and their potential for causing problems in the future  the Federal Reserve has taken a number of steps to ensure that practices are materially upgraded at foreign branches and that any weaknesses continue to be uncovered. In addition to identifying and addressing internal control and audit weaknesses through examinations and supervisory follow-up  these efforts include ensuring that the foreign bank provides the necessary managerial support to its U.S. branches  including adequate systems of controls and audit. To place even more emphasis on internal controls and audit systems  the foreign branch rating system was revised in 1994. Furthermore  in 1996 additional steps were taken to ensure that internal control weaknesses are corrected and will not cause financial harm by adopting requirements for audit procedures in situations where significant control weaknesses are detected. These efforts to detect problems at their early stages and resolve them appear to be having positive effects. After peaking in 1993  there has been a steady decline in the number of U.S. branches and agencies with an overall examination rating of fair or lower and a rating of fair or lower in an examination component substantively affected by internal control and audit weaknesses. We believe that our continued efforts in this area will lead to further improvements in the internal control and audit practices of foreign banking organizations Implementing the risk-focused approach has not been an easy task. It has required a significant revision of our broad and specialized training programs  including expansion of capital markets  information technology  and global trading activities  as well as courses devoted exclusively to internal controls. These education programs will  of course  need to be continually updated as industry activities and conditions evolve. With the greater discretion provided to examiners to focus on areas of highest risk  ensuring the consistency and quality of examinations has increased in importance. Fortunately  new training courses and improved examination platforms  tools  and programs that guide examiners through the appropriate selection of examination procedures will help. In addition  our ability to evaluate more thoroughly the quality of an examination has improved with the greater depth of analysis provided in supporting examination materials such as the written risk assessments and analysis of exam findings. Those materials are allowing us to perform comparative reviews of examinations across institutions of similar size  risk profile and complexity  to ensure quality and consistency. So far we have been able to evaluate the effectiveness of our examination programs by identifying whether problems are identified early and resolved in a timely fashion  by evaluating whether examination reports and findings provide clear feedback to management and identify areas of highest risk  and by monitoring the extent to which our examinations are complying with statutory mandates for the frequency of examinations. Based on those criteria  I believe our examination program has been generally successful. Application of technology to supervisory process BIS Review 93/1997 - 6 - The Federal Reserve has also done much to increase its own use of technology in an effort to improve examiner productivity  enhance analyses  and reduce burden on banks. Much of this effort has been conducted on an inter-agency basis  particularly in cooperation with the FDIC and state banking departments with whom we share supervision of state-chartered banks. Specific results include the development of a personal computer  lap-top workstation that provides examiners with a decision tree framework to assist them through the necessary procedures. The workstation also helps them document their work and prepare exam reports more efficiently. In addition  a software program has also been developed for receiving and analyzing loan portfolio data transmitted electronically from financial institutions. This process not only saves time but also improves the examiner’s understanding of the risks presented by individual portfolios. The Federal Reserve is also developing an electronic examination tool for large domestic and foreign banking organizations that enhances our ability to share examination analysis and findings and other pertinent supervisory information among our Reserve Banks and with other supervisory authorities. This platform should substantively improve our ability to provide comprehensive oversight to those firms that are most prominent in the payment system and global financial markets. In addition to examination tools  the Federal Reserve has for many years maintained a comprehensive source of banking structure  financial  and examination data in its National Information Center. By year-end  we will have completed significant enhancements to the tools that provide examiners and analysts at the federal and state banking agencies with access to those data. The Year 2000 One of the clearest reminders that managing technology is a challenge of its own is the need for banks to resolve the “Year 2000” problem. U.S. banks appear to be taking this matter seriously and are generally well underway toward identifying their individual needs and developing action plans. The Federal Reserve and the other federal bank supervisors are reviewing the relevant efforts of every insured depository institution in order to determine whether adequate progress on this issue is being made. This process should be complete by the middle of next year so that any detected deficiencies may be addressed in time. Meeting the demands of this review and ensuring proper remedies both before and after the year 2000 will be a significant and costly task to both the industry and the banking agencies. However  even within the context of banking  the scope of the Year 2000 problem extends far beyond U.S. banks to foreign banks  bank borrowers  depositors  vendors  and other counterparties. Through the Bank for International Settlements and other international forums  the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking agencies have emphasized the need for all institutions to recognize this issue and to address it actively. Importantly  century date compliance is gaining more attention internationally  and the Basle Supervisors Committee is taking steps to address this matter. Banks and others need to address year 2000 system alterations  not only because of the potential effects on overall markets  but also as a threat to individual firm viability. At a minimum  banks should be concerned about their ability to provide uninterrupted service to their customers into the next millennium. If nothing else  it is simply good business. Efforts to Accommodate Industry Growth and Innovation Another goal of the Federal Reserve’s supervisory approach is to remove unnecessary barriers that might hinder the industry’s ability to grow  innovate  and remain competitive. Recently  the Board refined its application process to ensure that well-run  well capitalized banking organizations may apply to acquire banks and nonbanks in a more streamlined fashion and BIS Review 93/1997 commence certain types of new activities without prior approval. The Board also significantly revised various rules for section 20 companies and scaled back or removed many redundant firewalls. While these refinements require some changes to the supervisory process  we firmly believe that removing barriers to these lower risk activities is essential to maintaining the industry’s health and competitiveness and its ability to serve its customers and the community. Supervising nationwide and international institutions The consolidation and transformation of the U.S. banking system resulting from evolving market  statutory  and regulatory changes are also requiring the Federal Reserve to adapt to new conditions. As previously noted  we are working closely with the FDIC and state banking agencies to deal with the challenges presented by interstate banking and branching to ensure that the dual banking system remains viable in future years. To address that goal  the FDIC  the Federal Reserve  and the state banking departments began on October 1 a common risk-focused process for the examination of state-chartered community banks. Another initiative has been the State/Federal Supervisory Protocol  which commits the various banking agencies to work toward a “seamless” and minimally burdensome oversight process. In short  it sets forth a process in which state banking supervisors will accept the supervisory reports of other agencies for banks operating in their states through branches  but headquartered elsewhere. The fact that the plan has been accepted by all involved parties is encouraging. We now need to ensure that it is implemented as intended  as banks make use of their broader branching powers. Similar coordination efforts are necessary and underway in an international context. Through the Bank for International Settlements  for example  the Federal Reserve and the other U.S. banking agencies participate with supervisors from other G-10 countries to develop not only prudential capital and other regulatory standards  but also to promote sound practices over a broad range of banking issues. In this regard  the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision  with the approval of the central bank Governors of the G-10 countries  recently issued three documents: one dealing with the management of interest rate risk by banks  one dealing with the Year 2000 problems  and another identifying 25 “core principles” of effective supervision that is directed at bank supervisors worldwide. The Basle Committee is also working to improve international risk disclosure practices of banks  and has created the new market risk capital standard that is based on banks’ internal value-at-risk models. That standard goes into effect in January of next year. Beyond the work of the Basle Committee and the banking agencies  we are also meeting with the SEC and international securities and insurance regulators to identify common issues  and to bring about greater convergence in our respective regulatory frameworks. That effort also has links to the Committee’s efforts and should prove helpful in strengthening the oversight and regulation of financial institutions throughout the world that provide a broad range of financial products. Successful groundwork from this effort could also have implications for moving forward domestically in an era of financial reform. Guidance as well as supervisory and regulatory standards such as these -- whether developed in a domestic or international context -- are soon incorporated into examination procedures and help examiners in their reviews of many of the more complex activities of global banking organizations. These global institutions are perhaps the most challenging to supervise. Since it is not feasible for supervisors to review all locations of a global banking organization  emphasis is placed on the integrity of risk management and internal control systems  coordination with international supervisors  strong capital standards  and improved disclosures. BIS Review 93/1997 - 8 - Staffing the Supervisory Process A final supervisory challenge relates to the Federal Reserve’s need to continue attracting  training  and retaining expert staff. Retaining sufficient numbers of individuals with the expertise to evaluate fully the risks in a rapidly changing banking industry is a major priority for the Federal Reserve and figures prominently in the bank supervision function’s strategic plan. Particularly challenging is attracting and retaining specialists in the areas of capital markets and information technology where we have experienced increased turnover. We will continue efforts to attract and retain both specialists and generalists who are qualified to address issues as the industry evolves. As I have outlined in my testimony  the Federal Reserve’s supervisory strategy is to maintain staff who can adequately evaluate the general soundness of banking activities by placing strong emphasis on the bank’s management processes  systems  and controls. I believe such an approach will serve us well as the industry continues to evolve either by expanding the scope of its activities or legislation. Nevertheless  developing the supervisory techniques  and attracting and training the personnel to do the job will pose a continuing challenge in the years ahead. through broader structural changes from financial modernization Conclusion The history of banking and of bank supervision shows a long and rather close relationship between the health of the banking system and the economy  a connection reflecting the role of banks in the credit intermediation process. We can expect that relationship to continue and for bank earnings and asset quality to fluctuate as economic conditions change. As supervisors  we must prepare for such developments. In many ways  however  the banking and financial system have changed dramatically in the past decade both in terms of structure and diversity of activities. Risk management practices have also advanced  helped by technological and financial innovations. I believe that both bank supervisors and the banking industry have learned important lessons from the experience of the past ten years specifically about the need to actively monitor  manage and control risks. Nevertheless  conditions can always change  and the risk-focused approach will be continually challenged to anticipate and avoid new kinds of problems. We must recognize that a risk-focused approach to supervision is a developing process and however successful it may be  there will again be bank failures. Indeed  having no bank failures may suggest inadequate risk-taking by banks and less economic growth. Through our supervisory process  the Federal Reserve seeks to maintain the proper balance -- permitting banks maximum freedom  while still protecting the safety net and maintaining financial stability. Devoting adequate attention to banking practices and conditions and responding promptly as events unfold is the key. We intend to do that now and in the years ahead. BIS Review 93/1997

After decades of budgetary imprudence  there has been a growing recognition of our fiscal problems in recent years and an increased willingness of Presidents and Congresses to address them. The capping of discretionary programs and the first steps to deal with entitlement programs are encouraging  as  unquestionably  is the slower pace at which we are creating new entitlement programs. But it is important to place this improvement in the context of the decades-long deterioration in our fiscal position; we have stopped the erosion for now  but we have made only a downpayment on the longer-range problem confronting us. Moreover  much of the fiscal improvement of recent years is less the result of a return to the prudent attitudes and actions of earlier generations  than the emergence of benevolent forces largely external to the fiscal process. The end of the Cold War has yielded a substantial peace dividend  and the best economic performance in decades has augmented tax revenues far beyond expectations while restraining countercyclically sensitive outlays. The payout of the peace dividend is coming to an end. Defense outlays have fallen from 6.2 percent of GDP in 1985 to 3.4 percent this year. Further cuts may be difficult to achieve  for even if we are fortunate enough to enjoy a relatively tranquil world  spending will tend to be buoyed by the need to replace technologically obsolescent equipment  as well as by the usual political pressures. The long-term outlook for the American economy presents us with  perhaps  even greater uncertainties. There can be little doubt that the American economy in the last several years has performed far better than the history of business expansions would have led us to expect. Labor markets have tightened considerably without inflation emerging as it has in the past. Encouraged by these results  financial markets seem to have priced in an optimistic outlook  characterized by a significant reduction in risk and an increasingly benevolent inflation process. For example  in equity markets  continual upward revisions of longer-term corporate earnings expectations have driven price-earnings ratios to levels not often observed at this stage of an economic expansion. Contributing to the expected increases in profits is a perceived marked increase in the prospective rate of return on new business ventures. This is evidenced by the sharp increase in capital investment since early 1993  especially in hi-tech equipment  which has persisted and even accelerated in recent quarters. Underlying this apparent bulge in expected profitability and rates of return  as I suggested in my July Humphrey-Hawkins testimony  may be a maturing of major technologies in recent years. The synergies of lasers and fiber optics have spurred large increases in communications investments. The continued extraordinary spread of computer-related applications  as costs of manipulating data and other information fall  has also been a major factor in increased investment outlays. The combination of advancing telecommunications and computer technologies have induced large investment outlays to support the Internet and utilize it to realize efficiencies in purchasing  production  and marketing. This dramatic change in technology  as I pointed out in earlier testimony  has markedly shortened the lead times in bringing new production facilities on line to meet increased BIS Review 93/1997 - 2 - demand  and has accordingly significantly reduced longer-term bottlenecks and materials shortages  phenomena often leading to inflation in the past. Indeed  this faster response of facility capacity  coupled with dramatic declines in transportation costs owing to a downsizing of products  has led to speculation that we are operating with a new “paradigm ” where price pressures need rarely ever arise because low-cost capacity  both here and abroad  can be brought on sufficiently rapidly when demand accelerates. Before we go too far in this direction  however  we need to recall that it was just three years ago that we were confronted with bottlenecks in the industrial sector. Though less extensive than in years past at similarly high levels of capacity utilization  they were nonetheless putting visible upward pressures on prices at early stages of the production chain. Further strides toward greater flexibility of facilities have occurred since 1994  but this is clearly an evolutionary  not a revolutionary  process. At least for the foreseeable future  it will still take time to bring many types of new facilities into the production process  and productive capacity will still impose limits on meeting large unexpected increases in demand in a short period. More relevant  by far  however  is that technology and management changes have had only a limited effect on the ability of labor supply to respond to changes in demand. To be sure  individual firms have acquired additional flexibility through increased use of outsourcing and temporary workers. In addition  smaller work teams may be able to adapt more readily to variations in order flows. While these techniques put the right workers at the right spots to reduce bottlenecks  they do not increase the aggregate supply of labor. That supply is sensitive to changes in demand  but to a far more limited extent than facilities. New plants can almost always be built. But labor capacity for an individual country is constrained by the size of the working-age population  which  except for immigration  is basically determined several decades in the past. Its lead time reflects biology  not technology. Of course  the demand for capital facilities and labor are not entirely independent. Within limits  labor and capital are substitutes  and slack in one market can offset tightness in another. For example  additional work shifts often can expand output without significant addition to facilities. Similarly  more labor-saving equipment can permit production to be increased with the same level of employment  an outcome that we would observe as increased labor productivity. As I will be discussing in a moment  we are seeing some favorable signs in this regard  but they are only suggestive  and the potential for increased productivity to enhance the effective supply of labor is limited. The fact is  that despite large additions to the capital stock in recent years  the supply of labor has kept pace with the demand for goods and services and the labor to produce them only by reducing the margin of slack in labor markets. Of the more than two million net new hires at an annual rate from early 1994 through the third quarter of this year  little more than half came from an expansion in the population aged 16 to 64 who wanted a job  and more than a third of those were net new immigrants. The remaining one million per year increase in employment was pulled from those who had been reported as unemployed (nearly 700 thousand annually) and those who wanted  but had not actively sought  a job (more than 300 thousand annually). The latter  of course  are not in the official unemployment count. The key point is that continuously digging ever deeper into the available working-age population is not a sustainable trajectory for job creation. The unemployment rate has a downside limit  if for no other reason than unemployment  in part  reflects voluntary periods of job search and other frictional unemployment  and includes people whose skills are not well adapted to work today and would be very costly to employ. BIS Review 93/1997 In addition  there is a limit on how many of the millions who wanted a job but were not actively seeking one could be readily absorbed into jobs -- in particular  the large number whose availability is limited by their enrollment in school  and those who may lack the necessary skills or may face other barriers to taking jobs. The number of people saying they would like a job  but have not been engaged in active job search  declined dramatically in 1996. But  despite increasingly favorable labor markets  few more of these 5 million individuals have been added to payrolls in 1997. This group of potential workers  on balance  is at its lowest level relative to the working-age population since at least 1970. As a source of new workers we may have reached about as far as is feasible into this group of the population. Presumably  some of the early retirees  students  or homemakers who do not now profess to want to work could be lured to the job market. Rewards sufficient to make jobs attractive  however  could conceivably also engender upward pressures on labor costs that would trigger renewed price pressures  undermining the expansion. Thus  there would seem to be emerging constraints on potential labor input. If the recent 2 million plus annual pace of job creation were to continue  the pressures on wages and other costs of hiring large numbers of such individuals could escalate more rapidly. To be sure  job growth slowed significantly in August and September  but it did not slow enough to close  from the demand side alone  the gap of the demand for labor over the supply from increases in the working-age population. Thus  the performance of the labor markets this year suggests that the economy has been on an unsustainable track. That the marked rate of absorption of potential workers since 1994 has not induced a more dramatic increase in employee compensation per hour and price inflation has come as a major surprise to most analysts. The strengthened exchange value of the dollar  which has helped contain price increases  is certainly one factor in explaining business reluctance to grant wage increases. Another explanation I have offered in the past is that the acceleration in technology and capital investment  in part by engendering important changes in the types of facilities with which people work on a day-by-day basis  has also induced a discernible increase in fear of job skill obsolescence and  hence  an increasing willingness to seek job security in lieu of wage gains. Certainly  the dramatic rise in recent years of on-the-job to school -- especially those aged twenty-five to thirty-four  mainly at the college level -- suggests significant concerns about skills. training and a substantial in people returning increase But the force of insecurity may be fading. Public opinion polls  which recorded a marked increase in fear of job loss from 1991 to 1995  a period of tightening labor markets  now indicate a partial reversal of that uptrend. To be sure  there is still little evidence of wage acceleration. To believe  however  that wage pressures will not intensify as the group of people who are not working  but who would like to  rapidly diminishes  strains credibility. The law of supply and demand has not been repealed. If labor demand continues to outpace sustainable increases in supply  the question is surely when  not whether  labor costs will escalate more rapidly. Of course  a fall-off in the current pace of demand for goods and services could close the gap and avoid the emergence of inflationary pressures. So could a sharp improvement in productivity growth  which would reduce the pace of new hiring required to produce a given rate of growth of real output. BIS Review 93/1997 - 4 - Productivity growth in manufacturing  as best we can measure it  apparently did pick up some in the third quarter and the broader measures of productivity growth have exhibited a modest quickening this year. Certainly  the persistence  even acceleration  of commitments to invest in new facilities suggests that the actual profitability of recent past investments  and by extension increased productivity  has already been achieved to some degree rather than being merely prospective. However  to reduce the recent two million plus annual rate of job gains to the one million rate consistent with long-term population growth would require  all else equal  a full percentage point increase in the rate of productivity growth. While not inconceivable  such a rapid change is rare in the annals of business history  especially for a mature industrial society of our breadth and scope. Clearly  impressive new technologies have imparted a sense of change in which previous economic relationships are seen as being less reliable now. Improvements in productivity are possible if worker skills increase  but gains come slowly through experience  education  and on-the-job training. They are also possible as capital substitutes for labor  but that is limited by the state of current technology. Very significant advances in productivity require technological breakthroughs that alter fundamentally the efficiency with which we use our labor and capital resources. But at the cutting edge of technology  where America finds itself  major improvements cannot be produced on demand. New ideas that matter are hard won. Short of a marked slowing in the demand for goods and services and  hence  labor -- or a degree of acceleration of productivity growth that appears unlikely -- the imbalance between the growth in labor demand and the expansion of potential labor supply of recent years must eventually erode the current state of inflation quiescence and  with it  the solid growth of real activity. In this context  the economic outlook sketched out for the United States by both the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office is realistic  even in some sense conservative. But you should recognize the range of possible long-term outcomes  both significantly better or worse  has risen markedly in the last year. An acceleration of productivity growth  should it materialize  would put the economy on a higher trend growth path than they have projected. The development of inflationary pressures  on the other hand  would doubtless create an environment of slower growth in real output than that projected by OMB or CBO. A re-emergence of inflation is  without question  the greatest threat to sustaining what has been a balanced economic expansion virtually without parallel in recent decades. In this regard  we at the Federal Reserve recognize that how we handle monetary policy will be a significant factor influencing the path of economic growth and  hence  fiscal outcomes. Given the wider range of possible outcomes that we face for long-term economic growth  the corresponding ranges of possible budget outcomes over the next five to ten years also has widened appreciably. In addition to the uncertainties associated with economic outcomes  questions may be raised about other assumptions behind both projected receipts and outlays. With regard to the former  it is difficult to believe that our much higher-than-expected income tax receipts of late are unrelated to the huge increase in capital gains  which since 1995 have totaled the equivalent of one-third of national income. Aside from the question of whether stock prices will rise or fall  it clearly would be unrealistic to look for a continuation of stock market gains of anything like the magnitude of those recorded in the past couple of years. On the outlay side  the recently enacted budget agreement relies importantly on significant  but as-yet-unspecified  restraints on discretionary spending to be made in the years 2001  BIS Review 93/1997 2002  and thereafter. Supporters of each program expect the restraints to fall elsewhere. Inevitably  the eventual publication of the detail will expose deep political divisions  which could make the realization of the budget projections less likely. In addition  while the budget agreement included significant cuts in Medicare spending  past experience has shown us how difficult Medicare is to control  raising the possibility that savings will never be realized. More generally  I wonder whether there is enough funding slack to accommodate contingencies  or the inevitable new  but as yet unidentified  spending programs. Budget forecasts are understandably subject to fairly large errors. Seemingly small changes in receipts and outlays are magnified in the budget deficit. For example  during the 1990s  the average absolute error in the projections of February for receipts and outlays in the fiscal years starting the subsequent October has been greater than four percent. A four percent error in both outlays and receipts in opposite directions amounts to more than $125 billion annually. Indeed  the uncertainty of budget forecasts is no better illustrated than by an admittedly extreme case. During the last two and a half years the projection of the fiscal balance  excluding new initiatives  for the year 2002 has changed by about $250 billion. While all this fortunately has been in the direction of smaller deficits  the degree of uncertainty suggests that the error could just as easily be on the other side. With this high level of uncertainty in projecting budget totals and associated deficits  the Congress needs to evaluate the consequences to long-term economic growth of errors in fiscal policy. A base issue in such an evaluation is whether we are better off to be targeting a large deficit  balance  or a chronic surplus in our unified budget. There is nothing special about budget balance per se  except that it is far superior to deficits. I have always emphasized the value of a budgetary surplus in increasing national savings  especially when American private domestic savings is low  as it is today. Higher national savings lead in the long run to higher investment and living standards. They also foster low inflation. Low inflation itself may be responsible  in part  for higher productivity growth and larger gains in standards of living. If economic growth and rising living standards  fostered by investment and price stability  are our goal  fiscal policy in my judgment will need to be biased toward surpluses in the years immediately ahead. This is especially so given the inexorable demographic trends that threaten huge increases in outlays beyond 2010. We should view the recent budget agreement  even if receipts and outlays evolve as expected  as only an important downpayment on the larger steps we need to take to solve the harder problem -- putting our entitlement programs on a sound financial footing for the 21st century. Moreover  targeted surpluses could hopefully help to offset the inbuilt political bias in favor of budget deficits. I have been in too many budget meetings in the last three decades not to have learned that the ideal fiscal initiative from a political perspective is one that creates visible benefits for one group of constituents without a perceived cost to anybody else  a form of political single-entry bookkeeping. To be sure  in recent years we have been showing some real restraint in our approach to fiscal policy. Yet  despite terminating a number of programs  the ratio of federal nondefense  noninterest  spending to GDP still stands at nearly 14 percent  double what it was in the 1950s. This may be one reason why inflation premiums  embodied in long-term interest rates  still are significant. There is  thus  doubtless a lot of catching up to do. The current initiatives toward welfare  social security  and Medicare reform are clearly steps in the right direction  but far more is required. Let us not squander years of efforts to BIS Review 93/1997 - 6 - balance the budget and the benefits of ideal economic conditions by failing to address our long-term imbalances. A critical imbalance is the one faced by social security. Its fund’s reported imbalance stems primarily from the fact that  until very recently  the payments into the social security trust accounts by the average employee  plus employer contributions and interest earned  were inadequate  at retirement  to fund the total of retirement benefits. This has started to change. Under the most recent revisions to the law  and presumably conservative economic and demographic assumptions  today’s younger workers will be paying social security taxes over their working years that appear sufficient to fund their benefits during retirement. However  the huge liability for current retirees  as well as for much of the work force closer to retirement  leaves the system  as a whole  badly underfunded. The official unfunded liability for the Old Age  Survivors and Disability funds  which takes into account expected future tax payments and benefits out to the year 2070  has reached a staggering $3 trillion. This issue of funding underscores the critical elements in the forthcoming debate on social security reform  because it focusses on the core of any retirement system  private or public. Simply put  enough must be set aside over a lifetime of work to fund the excess of consumption over claims on production a retiree may enjoy. At the most rudimentary level  one could envision households saving by actually storing goods purchased during their working years for consumption during retirement. Even better  the resources that would have otherwise gone into the stored goods could be diverted to the production of new capital assets  which would  cumulatively  over a working lifetime  produce an even greater quantity of goods and services to be consumed in retirement. In the latter case  we would be getting more output per worker  our traditional measure of productivity  and a factor that is central in all calculations of long-term social security trust fund financing. Hence  the bottom line in all retirement programs is physical resource availability. The finance of any system is merely to facilitate the underlying system of allocating real resources that fund retirement consumption of goods and services. Unless social security savings are increased by higher taxes (with negative consequences for growth) or lowered benefits  domestic savings must be augmented by greater private saving or surpluses in the rest of the government budget to help ensure that there is enough savings to finance adequate productive capacity down the road to meet the consumption needs of both retirees and active workers. The basic premise of our current largely pay-as-you-go social security system is that future productivity growth will be sufficient to supply promised retirement benefits for current workers. However  even supposing some acceleration in long-term productivity growth from recent experience  at existing rates of domestic saving and capital investment this is becoming increasingly dubious. Accordingly  short of a far more general reform of the system  there are a number of initiatives  at a minimum  that should be addressed. As I argued at length in the Social Security Commission deliberations of 1983  with only marginal effect  some delaying of the age of eligibility for retirement benefits will become increasingly pressing. For example  adjusting the full-benefits retirement age to keep pace with increases in life expectancy in a way that would keep the ratio of retirement years to expected life span approximately constant would help to significantly narrow the funding gap. Such an initiative will become easier to implement as fewer and fewer of our older citizens retire from physically arduous work. Hopefully  other modifications to social security  such as improved cost of living indexing  will be instituted. There are a number of thoughtful reform initiatives that  through the process of privatization  could increase domestic saving rates. These are clearly worthy of intensive evaluation. Perhaps the strongest argument for privatization is that replacing the current underfunded system with BIS Review 93/1997 a fully funded one could boost domestic saving. But  we must remember it is because privatization plans might increase savings that makes them potentially valuable  not their particular form of financing. As I have argued elsewhere  unless national savings is increased  shifting social security trust funds to private securities  while increasing government retirement system income  will lower retirement incomes in the private sector to an offsetting degree. This would not be an improvement to our overall retirement system. The types of changes that will be required to restore fiscal balance to our social security accounts  in the broader scheme of things  are significant but manageable. More important  most entail changes that are less unsettling if they are enacted soon  even if their effects are significantly delayed  rather than waiting five or ten years or longer for legislation. Minimizing the potential disruptions associated with the inevitable changes to social security is made all the more essential because of the pressing financial problems in the Medicare system  social security’s companion program for retirees. Medicare as you are well aware is in an even more precarious position than social security. The financing of Medicare faces some of the same problems associated with demographics and productivity as social security but faces different  and currently greater  pressures owing to the behavior of medical costs and utilization rates. Reform of the Medicare system will require more immediate and potentially more dramatic changes than those necessary to reform social security. We owe it to those who will retire after the turn of the century to be given sufficient advance notice to make what alterations in retirement planning may be required. The longer we wait to make what are surely inevitable adjustments  the more difficult they will become. If we procrastinate too long  the adjustments could be truly wrenching. Our senior citizens  both current and future  deserve better. BIS Review 93/1997

The challenges ahead for monetary policy Today  I would like to talk about some of the important issues and challenges facing monetary policy in the period ahead and how the Bank of Canada proposes to deal with them. This is not an unusual topic for me since the business of central banking is seldom without challenges. But what a difference the past two years have made to the challenges we face! Let me remind you that it was in late 1995  when investors’ concerns about Canada’s fiscal and political problems finally began to recede  that the Bank of Canada was able to take action to provide substantial monetary support to the economy. This action  which continued over the next year or so  was designed to offset both the direct impact on the economy of fiscal restraint and the effects on consumer confidence of the difficulties and uncertainties arising from the major restructurings that were necessary in both the private and public sectors. In response to the monetary stimulus  the economy has gathered momentum and finally seems to have pulled free from the difficulties associated with the restructuring. Indeed  economic activity has accelerated this year and has expanded by about 4 per cent over the course of the past 12 months. With the economic momentum expected to continue at a solid pace in the period ahead  monetary policy now faces new challenges. Over the next year or two  as the remaining slack is absorbed and we move towards full use of the economy’s capacity to produce  the issue for monetary policy will be to try to ensure that this process goes smoothly and that inflationary pressures do not re-emerge. Further down the road  we will also have to concern ourselves with the conduct of monetary policy as the economy operates under conditions of full capacity. With all the structural changes that have taken place in Canada and around the world in recent years  one important issue will be to gauge just how rapidly our economy can grow on a sustainable basis -- that is  without generating inflation pressures -- and what this implies for the employment picture in Canada. The challenge for monetary policy at that stage will be how best to deal with the uncertainty surrounding estimates of the economy’s potential to produce. The conduct of monetary policy through the economic upswing and then under conditions of full capacity are the two topics I would like to discuss with you today. Returning to full capacity Let me start with the immediate challenge for monetary policy -- to promote monetary conditions that will preserve Canada’s good inflation performance through the current economic upswing  thereby helping to make this economic expansion a long-lasting one. As I mentioned  monetary conditions in Canada have been very stimulative for over a year. With growing evidence that economic activity was expanding smartly  the Bank of Canada began reminding Canadians that  as slack in the economy is taken up  there would be a need to move to less-stimulative monetary conditions. We took a step in that direction last week when we raised our Bank Rate by ¼ of a percentage point to 3¾ per cent. BIS Review 94/1997 - 2 - This kind of action can set off alarm bells in the minds of some people. They may wonder why the Bank of Canada is “slamming on the brakes” when the economy has only just begun to pick up and the unemployment rate is still high. I would like to respond to any such concerns by explaining what Canadians can expect from their central bank in the period ahead and why. But before I do so  I would like to remind you that  when we at the Bank talk about how stimulative monetary conditions have been  we are not just looking at short-term interest rates (which are still near their lowest levels in decades and well below comparable U.S. rates). Monetary conditions also take into account the effects on the economy of changes in the exchange rate for the Canadian dollar. For example  the relatively low value of our dollar has been a major source of stimulus for Canada’s export sector. So a proper assessment of the degree of monetary ease in the economy has to consider both our low interest rates and the relatively low Canadian dollar. Now  what about the perception that any move by the Bank of Canada to less-stimulative monetary conditions means “slamming on the brakes” for our economy? Let me stay with the automobile analogy for a moment. To get the economy moving  the Bank has been pressing hard on the monetary accelerator. But once the economy picks up speed  just as with a car  you need to ease off gradually on the accelerator and steady your cruising speed at a safe level. If you press hard on the accelerator for too long  you will reach speeds that are unsafe. You risk losing control and getting into serious trouble. The same holds true for the economy. Too much monetary stimulus can lead to an exhilarating temporary burst of economic activity. But it will almost certainly also lead to inflation-related distortions that undermine both the expansion and the economy’s efficiency over the longer term. The end result  as we know only too well from past experience  is high interest rates  punishing debt loads  recession  and higher unemployment. A further complication is that it takes between a year to a year and a half for the economy to fully respond to changes in the degree of monetary stimulus. In this sense  the economy is like a car that doesn’t respond immediately when you ease off on the accelerator but only a mile or so further down the road. With such a car  you want to be able to look a long way ahead to see what is coming  and you want to take action early to ensure that your speed is appropriate. This is why monetary policy must focus on the future  rather than the present  and why the Bank must act in a forward-looking  pre-emptive manner. In other words  if we want our economy to reach full capacity relatively smoothly  without the risk of repeating the painful  inflation-related boom and bust cycles of the past  we must be ready to take timely action. If we wait to act until the economy is going flat out and pressing hard on the limits of its capacity to produce  we will have waited too long. Thus  some combination of a further rise in short-term interest rates and an increase in the value of the Canadian dollar will likely be necessary in coming months. I hasten to add that such a rise in short-term rates is the best way to preserve medium- and long-term rates at low levels. And it is these longer-term rates that are so important for the investments in new technology and other initiatives to increase productivity that Canadian businesses need to stay competitive. Let me reassure you that we are not talking about anything like the short-term interest rate increases that we saw in the 1970s and 1980s  or even in 1995. In an environment of low inflation and improved fiscal health  interest rates should not have to get that high again. You will not be surprised that I cannot give you in advance precise information about any further action the Bank may take to reduce the amount of monetary stimulus in the economy. What I can tell you is that it is the strength of the momentum of demand  and thus how quickly the economy approaches the limits of its capacity to meet that demand  that will determine the timing and extent of our response. Close monitoring of the strength of demand in the economy  and timely  BIS Review 94/1997 - 3 - measured steps in the right direction  will help us avoid the more substantial  and potentially more disruptive  tightening that would be required later on if monetary policy actions were unduly delayed. Moreover  the magnitude of the increase in short-term interest rates will be influenced by the extent of the exchange rate response. I hope this makes it clear that what the Bank of Canada has in mind  and is aiming for  is a “gradual easing off on the accelerator” in the months ahead  so that there will be no need to “slam on the brakes” later on. Making the most of the economy’s production potential Next  let me say a few words about the challenges that await us further down the road. One of the more remarkable international economic developments of the past few years has been the performance of the U.S. economy. That economy has had six years of solid economic expansion  with high rates of job creation and low inflation. In the late 1980s  when the U.S. unemployment rate dipped below 6 per cent  there were strong inflationary pressures. Compare this with the present situation: the U.S. economy has been expanding at an average rate of about 3½ per cent for 8 quarters  current levels of demand are above most estimates of its capacity to produce  and the unemployment rate has been at or below 5 per cent for several months. Yet inflation has remained well behaved. What is happening? Are we operating in a different environment? There are  of course  some temporary factors -- such as the appreciation of the U.S. dollar  the decline in energy prices  and the slack in overseas economies -- that are currently helping to suppress inflationary pressures in the United States. However  a number of observers are suggesting that other  more permanent factors may also be contributing. One possibility  which has been rather widely discussed recently  is that all the structural changes that have taken place in the United States have raised the production capacity of the economy and reduced the risk of inflation. I believe that another important factor in this success story has been the strong credibility of monetary policy in the United States. By persuading Americans that it is determined to maintain low inflation  the U.S. Federal Reserve has given itself room to test the potential of the economy without triggering the quick response in wages and prices from worried workers and businesses that we saw during the years of high inflation. How does this U.S. experience relate to Canada? Can we also look forward to an improvement in the longer-term performance of our economy? Unfortunately  it is not possible to make that judgement in advance  given the complexity of the factors affecting economic performance. How rapid growth can be and still be sustainable  and how low our unemployment rate will go  will ultimately depend on the flexibility  efficiency  and productivity of Canadian enterprises. I am referring here to the effective use of new technology; the skills  training  and adaptability of our labour force; our ability to control costs; and the initiative and ability of Canadian businesses to find and develop new and expanded foreign markets for their products. The contribution that monetary policy can make towards realizing this potential is to ensure that the pace of economic expansion remains sustainable. This essentially means encouraging monetary conditions that will allow the economy to test the limits of its capacity to expand  but without setting off inflation and the costly boom and bust cycles of the past two decades. As in the United States  the problem in Canada is that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the level of economic activity that can be accommodated by our capacity to produce and how rapidly this capacity will expand over time. This is where the Bank of Canada’s BIS Review 94/1997 - 4 - inflation-control target should prove useful as we try to steer the economy along a sustainable growth path. That target is to hold inflation inside a range of 1 to 3 per cent. One of the advantages of such an explicit target is that it provides a ready measure of the state of the economy by comparing the actual trend of inflation against the target range. If the trend of inflation looks as though it will be pushing through the top of the target range  this implies that demand in the economy has been unsustainably strong  and monetary conditions must be tightened. But if inflation is persistently lower than past history and the existing levels of demand would suggest  and it is tending to press the bottom of the range  chances are that there is more room for the economy to expand than previously thought  and monetary conditions can be easier. However  if the Bank of Canada is going to respond to such signals  we must ensure that our inflation-control strategy is a credible one. It is by conducting monetary policy in a prudent manner during the economic upswing that the Bank can provide Canadians with assurance that inflation will remain under control when the economy begins to operate at levels that push against the limits of capacity. If businesses  individuals  and investors are persuaded that inflation will stay low  they will not respond immediately to signs of strong demand pressures by seeking to raise prices and wages and by pushing up interest rates. Such an environment provides the flexibility necessary for the economy to test the limits of growth and employment without immediately putting the economic expansion at risk. Concluding remarks In conclusion  let me just say that the period ahead will be an exciting one. At no time since the 1960s have we had in place the conditions that would permit the Canadian economy to fully realize its potential. With inflation under control and increasingly favourable fiscal positions  we now have an opportunity to see what our economy is capable of delivering  in terms of sustained growth in output and employment and improving standards of living. The Bank of Canada’s role is to make sure that monetary policy provides the right background -- a stable  low-inflation environment. BIS Review 94/1997

Globalization of Finance As a result of very rapid increases in telecommunications and computer-based technologies and products  a dramatic expansion in cross-border financial flows and within countries has emerged. The pace has become truly remarkable. These technology-based developments have so expanded the breadth and depth of markets that governments  even reluctant ones  increasingly have felt they have had little alternative but to deregulate and free up internal credit and financial markets. In recent years global economic integration has accelerated on a multitude of fronts. While trade liberalization  which has been ongoing for a longer period  has continued  more dramatic changes have occurred in the financial sphere. in communications and World financial markets undoubtedly are far more efficient today than ever before. Changes instruments and risk-management techniques they have made possible  enable an ever wider range of financial and non-financial firms today to manage their financial risks more effectively. As a consequence  they can now concentrate on managing the economic risks associated with their primary businesses. technology  and information the new The solid profitability of new financial products in the face of their huge proliferation attests to the increasing effectiveness of financial markets in facilitating the flow of trade and direct investment  which are so patently contributing to ever higher standards of living around the world. Complex financial instruments -- derivative instruments  in one form or another -- are being developed to take advantage of the gains in communications and information technology. Such instruments would not have flourished as they have without the technological advances of the past several decades. They could not be priced properly  the markets they involve could not be arbitraged properly  and the risks they give rise to could not be managed at all  to say nothing of properly  without high-powered data processing and communications capabilities. Still  for central bankers with responsibilities for financial market stability  the new technologies and new instruments have presented new challenges. Some argue that market dynamics have been altered in ways that increase the likelihood of significant market disruptions. Whatever the merits of this argument  there is a clear sense that the new technologies  and the financial instruments and techniques they have made possible  have strengthened interdependencies between markets and market participants  both within and across national boundaries. As a result  a disturbance in one market segment or one country is likely to be transmitted far more rapidly throughout the world economy than was evident in previous eras. In earlier generations information moved slowly  constrained by the primitive state of communications. Financial crises in the early nineteenth century  for example  particularly those associated with the Napoleonic Wars  were often related to military and other events in faraway places. An investor’s speculative position could be wiped out by a military setback  and he might not even know about it for days or even weeks  which  from the perspective of central banking today  might be considered bliss. As the nineteenth century unfolded  communications speeded up. By the turn of thecentury events moved more rapidly  but their speed was at most a crawl by the standard of today’s financial markets. The environment now facing the world’s central banks -- and  of course  private participants in financial markets as well -- is characterized by instant communication. BIS Review 94/1997 - 2 - This morning I should like to take a few minutes to trace the roots of this extraordinary expansion of global finance  endeavor to assess its benefits and risks  and suggest some avenues that can usefully be explored in order to contain some of its potentially adverse consequences. A global financial system  of course  is not an end in itself. It is the institutional structure that has been developed over the centuries to facilitate the production of goods and services. Accordingly  we can better understand the evolution of today’s burgeoning global financial markets by parsing the extraordinary changes that have emerged  in the past century or more  in what we conventionally call the real side of economies: the production of goods and services. The same technological forces currently driving finance were first evident in the production process and have had a profound effect on what we produce  how we produce it  and how it is financed. Technological change or  more generally  ideas have significantly altered the nature of output so that it has become increasingly conceptual and less physical. A much smaller proportion of the measured real gross domestic product constitutes physical bulk today than in past generations. The increasing substitution of concepts for physical effort in the creation of economic value also has affected how we produce that economic output; computer-assisted design systems  machine tools  and inventory control systems provide examples. Offices are now routinely outfitted with high-speed information-processing technology. Because the accretion of knowledge is  with rare exceptions  irreversible  this trend almost surely will continue into the twenty-first century and beyond. Value creation at the turn of the twenty-first century will surely involve the transmission of information and ideas  generally over complex telecommunication networks. This will create considerably greater flexibility of where services are produced and where employees do their work. The transmission of ideas  or more broadly information  places it where it can be employed in maximum value creation. A century earlier  transportation of goods to their most value-creating locations served the same purpose for an economy whose value creation still rested heavily on physical  bulky output. Not unexpectedly  as goods and services have moved across borders  the necessity to finance them has increased dramatically. But what is particularly startling is how large the expansion in cross-border finance has become  relative to the trade it finances. To be sure  much cross-border finance supports investment portfolios  doubtless some largely speculative. But at bottom  even they are part of the support systems for efficient international movement of goods and services. The rapid expansion in cross-border banking and finance should not be surprising given the extent to which low-cost information processing and communications technology have improved the ability of customers in one part of the world to avail themselves of borrowing  depositing  or risk-management opportunities offered anywhere in the world on a real-time basis. These developments enhance the process whereby an excess of saving over investment in one country finds an appropriate outlet in another. In short  they facilitate the drive to equate risk-adjusted rates of return on investments worldwide. They thereby improve the worldwide allocation of scarce capital and  in the process  engender a huge increase in risk dispersion and hedging opportunities. But there is still evidence of less than full arbitrage of risk-adjusted rates of return on a worldwide basis. This suggests the potential for a far larger world financial system than currently exists. If we can resist protectionist pressures in our societies in the financial arena as well as in the BIS Review 94/1997 - 3 - interchange of goods and services  we can look forward to the benefits of the international division of labor on a much larger scale in the 21st century. What we don’t know for sure  but strongly suspect  is that the accelerating expansion of global finance may be indispensable to the continued rapid growth in world trade in goods and services. It is becoming increasingly evident that many layers of financial intermediation will be required if we are to capture the full benefits of our advances in finance. Certainly  the emergence of a highly liquid foreign exchange market has facilitated basic forex transactions  and the availability of more complex hedging strategies enables producers and investors to achieve their desired risk positions. This owes largely to the ability of modern financial products to unbundle complex risks in ways that enable each counterparty to choose the combination of risks necessary to advance its business strategy  and to eschew those that do not. This process enhances cross-border trade in goods and services  facilitates cross-border portfolio investment strategies  enhances the lower-cost financing of real capital formation on a worldwide basis and  hence  leads to an expansion of international trade and rising standards of living. But achieving those benefits surely will require the maintenance of a stable macroeconomic environment. An environment conducive to stable product prices and to maintaining sustainable economic growth has become a prime responsibility of governments and  of course  central banks. It was not always thus. In the last comparable period of open international trade a century ago the gold standard prevailed. The roles of central banks  where they existed (remember the United States did not have one)  were then quite different from today. International stabilization was implemented by more or less automatic gold flows from those financial markets where conditions were lax  to those where liquidity was in short supply. To some  myself included  the system appears to have worked rather well. To others  the gold standard was perceived as too rigid or unstable  and in any event the inability to finance discretionary policy  both monetary and fiscal  led first to a further compromise of the gold standard system after World War I  and by the 1930s it had been essentially abandoned. The fiat money systems that emerged have given considerable power and responsibility to central banks to manage the sovereign credit of nations. Under a gold standard  money creation was at the limit tied to changes in gold reserves. The discretionary range of monetary policy was relatively narrow. Today’s central banks have the capability of creating or destroying unlimited supplies of money and credit. Clearly  how well we take our responsibilities in this modern world has profound implications for participants in financial markets. We provide the backdrop against which individual market participants make their decisions. As a consequence  it is incumbent upon us to endeavor to produce the same non-inflationary environment as existed a century ago  if we seek maximum sustainable growth. In this regard  doubtless  the most important development that has occurred in recent years has been the shift from an environment of inflationary expectations built into both business planning and financial contracts toward an environment of lower inflation. It is important that that progress continue and that we maintain a credible long-run commitment to price stability. While there can be little doubt that the extraordinary changes in global finance on balance have been beneficial in facilitating significant improvements in economic structures and living standards throughout the world  they also have the potential for some negative consequences. In fact  while the speed of transmission of positive economic events has been an important plus for the world economy in recent years  it is becoming increasingly obvious  as evidenced by recent events in Thailand and its neighbors and several years ago in Mexico  that significant macroeconomic policy mistakes also reverberate around the world at a prodigious pace. In any event  technological progress is not reversible. We must learn to live with it. BIS Review 94/1997 - 4 - In the context of rapid changes affecting financial markets  disruptions are inevitable. The turmoil in the European Exchange Rate mechanism in 1992  the plunge in the exchange value of the Mexican peso at the end of 1994 and early 1995  and the recent sharp exchange rate adjustments in a number of Asian economies have shown how the new world of financial trading can punish policy misalignments  actual or perceived  with amazing alacrity. This is new. Even as recently as 15 or 20 years ago  the size of the international financial system was a fraction of what it is today. Contagion effects were more limited  and  thus  breakdowns carried fewer negative consequences. In both new and old environments  the economic consequences of disruptions are minimized if they are not further compounded by financial instability associated with underlying inflation trends. The recent financial turmoil in some Asian financial markets  and similar events elsewhere previously  confirm that in a world of increasing capital mobility there is a premium on governments maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and allowing exchange rates to provide appropriate signals for the broader pricing structure of the economy. These countries became vulnerable as markets became increasingly aware of a buildup of excesses  including overvalued exchange rates  bulging current account deficits  and sharp increases in asset values. In many cases  these were the consequence of poor investment judgements in seeking to employ huge increases in portfolios for investment. In some cases  these excesses were fed by unsound real estate and other lending activity by various financial institutions in these countries  which  in turn  undermined the soundness of these countries’ financial systems. As a consequence  these countries lost the confidence of both domestic and international investors  with resulting disturbances in their financial markets. The resort to capital controls to deal with financial market disturbances of the sort a number of emerging economies have experienced would be a step backwards from the trend toward financial market liberalization  and in the end would not be effective. The maintenance of financial stability in an environment of global capital markets  therefore  calls for greater attention by governments to the soundness of public policy. Governments are beginning to recognize that the release of timely and accurate economic and financial data is a critical element to the maintenance of financial stability. We do not know what the appropriate amount of disclosure is  but it is pretty clear from the Mexican experience in 1994 and the recent Thai experience that the level of disclosure was too little. More comprehensive public information on the financial condition of a country  including current data on commitments by governments to buy or sell currencies in the future and on non-performing loans of a country’s financial institutions  would allow investors -- both domestic and international -- to make more rational investment decisions. Such disclosure would help to avoid sudden and sharp reversals in the investment positions of investors once they become aware of the true status of a country’s and a banking system’s financial health. More timely and more comprehensive disclosure of financial data also would help sensitize the principal economic policymakers of a country to the potential emerging threats to its financial stability. Thus  as international financial markets continue to expand  central banks have twin objectives: achieving macroeconomic stability and a safe and sound financial system that can take advantage of stability while exploiting the inevitable new technological advances. The changing dynamics of modern global financial systems also require that central banks address the inevitable increase of systemic risk. It is probably fair to say that the very efficiency of global financial markets  engendered by the rapid proliferation of financial products  also has the capability of transmitting mistakes at a far faster pace throughout the financial system in ways that were unknown a generation ago  and not even remotely imagined in the nineteenth century. BIS Review 94/1997 - 5 - Today’s technology enables single individuals to initiate massive transactions with very rapid execution. Clearly  not only has the productivity of global finance increased markedly  but so  obviously  has the ability to generate losses at a previously inconceivable rate. Moreover  increasing global financial efficiency  by creating the mechanisms for mistakes to ricochet throughout the global financial system  has patently increased the potential for systemic risk. Why not then  one might ask  bar or contain the expansion of global finance by capital controls  transaction taxes  or other market inhibiting initiatives? Why not return to the less hectic and seemingly less threatening markets of  say  the 1950s? Endeavoring to thwart technological advance and new knowledge and innovation through the erection of barriers to the spread of knowledge would  as history amply demonstrates  have large  often adverse  unintended consequences. Suppressed markets in one location would be rapidly displaced by others outside the reach of government controls and taxes. Of greater importance  risk taking  so indispensable to the creation of wealth  would undoubtedly be curbed  to the detriment of rising living standards. We cannot turn back the clock on technology -- and we should not try to do so. Rather  we should recognize that  if it is technology that has imparted the current stress to markets  technology can be employed to contain it. Enhancements to financial institutions’ internal risk-management systems arguably constitute the most effective countermeasure to the increased potential instability of the global financial system. Improving the efficiency of the world’s payment systems is clearly another. The availability of new technology and new derivative financial instruments clearly has facilitated new  more rigorous approaches to the conceptualization  measurement  and management of risk for such systems. There are  however  limitations to the statistical models used in such systems owing to the necessity of overly simplifying assumptions. Hence  human judgements  based on analytically looser but far more realistic evaluations of what the future may hold  are of critical importance in risk management. Although a sophisticated understanding of statistical modeling techniques is important to risk management  an intimate knowledge of the markets in which an institution trades and of the customers it serves is turning out to be far more important. In these and other ways  we must assure that our rapidly changing global financial system retains the capacity to contain market shocks. This is a never-ending process that requires never-ending vigilance. BIS Review 94/1997

Meyer  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  before the Institute for Global Management and Research  School of Business and Public Management  The George Washington University  Washington  D.C.  on 14/10/97.,Mr. Meyer focuses on the effect of globalization on the conduct of US monetary policy Remarks by Mr. Laurence H. Meyer  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  before the Institute for Global Management and Research  School of Business and Public Management  The George Washington University  Washington  D.C.  on 14/10/97. World trade has increased much faster than world output over the last 30 years and international capital flows have expanded at a still more rapid pace. As a result  forecasting and modeling the national economic developments and the conduct of domestic policy has increasingly required more careful attention to the global context. My focus is on how globalization has affected the conduct of U.S. monetary policy. I begin by documenting the trend toward increased openness of the U.S. economy. With that background in place  I turn to the implications of increased openness for the conduct of U.S. monetary policy. The views I present here about the conduct of monetary policy are my own. They should not be interpreted as official policy positions of the Board of Governors or the FOMC. Some of the questions that I address along the way are: Does an open economy introduce either new objectives or new instruments for monetary policy? How does an open economy affect the monetary policy transmission mechanism? Does the rapid growth in cross-border capital flows limit or even eliminate the ability of domestic monetary policy to affect domestic interest rates? How does U.S. monetary policy affect economic conditions in other countries? How does globalization affect the cyclical properties of the U.S. economy  the inflation process  and longer-term trends in the economy? My conclusion is that  while the increasing openness has resulted in some important changes to how the U.S. economy operates  it has not fundamentally altered the determination of output and inflation  introduced new objectives of monetary policy  or offered new instruments to pursue those objectives. Nevertheless  it has importantly affected the monetary policy transmission mechanism and increasingly subjected the domestic economy to the effects of changes in economic conditions abroad. Documenting the trend toward increased openness of the U.S. economy The increased openness has two dimensions -- expanded trade in goods and services and expanded cross-border capital flows. A related indicator of openness is the volume of foreign exchange transactions  since both goods and financial asset transactions typically are preceded by currency conversions. U.S. trade in goods and services has increased about twice as fast as the growth in U.S. GDP over the last 3½ decades. This reflects the effect of both trade liberalization and technological advance  as well as the rapid growth of emerging markets recently. Trade liberalization -- including both a series of multi-lateral efforts through GATT and regional efforts such as NAFTA -- has involved both reduction in tariffs and the elimination of many non-tariff barriers to trade. Technological gains have reduced transportation costs and improved the flow of information about goods around the world. A measure of the openness of the U.S. economy in terms of trade in goods and services is the ratio of the sum of U.S. imports and exports to U.S. GDP. This ratio has almost tripled over the last 3½ decades  from 9% in 1960 to 24% in 1996. BIS Review 95/1997 - 2 - Even more striking is the expansion of international capital flows. Financial liberalization  deregulation  and technology  including the information revolution  have contributed to the globalization of asset markets. A measure of the net result of cross-border capital flows  the combined U.S. holdings of foreign securities and foreign holdings of U.S. securities  has increased more than tenfold just from 1980 to 1996. Foreigners now hold 33% of U.S. government securities  17% of U.S. corporate bonds  and 7% of U.S. corporate stocks. U.S. holdings of foreign securities have also increased. Foreign stocks now make up about 10% of U.S. residents’ equity holdings and foreign bonds make up about 4% of U.S. bond holdings. While the increase in cross-border capital flows is impressive  it is nevertheless clear that “home bias ” the concentration of domestic wealth in domestic assets  still exists. Another indicator of the increased openness of the U.S. and other economies is the volume of foreign exchange transactions  since these transactions are often the first step in effecting both foreign trade and cross-border capital flows. The daily volume of foreign exchange transactions surveyed in major financial centers doubled over the period from 1989 to 1995 to about $1.2 trillion  and more than four-fifths of these transactions involve dollars. The daily volume of foreign exchange transactions  however  is an imperfect measure of openness of the U.S. economy  because many transactions among other countries involve dollars. Monetary policy in a global economy: responding to external shocks One implication of a global economy is that external shocks  those arising from outside the country  become an additional source of disturbance to the U.S. economy and therefore an additional challenge to which monetary policy must respond. I will consider three types of external shocks: demand  supply  and exchange rate shocks. An example of a demand shock would be an unexpected change in the overall level of economic activity abroad  which would affect the demand for U.S. exports. For example  in the early 1970s  the latter 1970s  and late 1980s  global expansions and the resulting sharp increase in world commodity prices and demand for U.S. exports contributed to the mounting inflationary pressures and overheating in the United States. In the three episodes just noted  commodity price booms were exacerbated by a run-up in oil prices resulting from the disruption of supplies from the Middle East. In the mid-1980s  oil prices plummeted  contributing to a transitory decline in inflation and easing of monetary conditions. Such changes in world oil prices are an example of a supply shock  a change in the price of goods unrelated to the balance between supply and demand in the domestic market. Energy and food prices  in particular  are subject to volatile swings  due to political decisions  weather  or other developments unrelated to overall domestic economic conditions. The United States is vulnerable to oil price shocks both because we have a very high consumption of oil and because we import about 50% of crude petroleum. The rise in oil prices not only has a sharp effect on overall prices in the United States  but  given the relatively inelastic demand for energy  results in an increase in real imports and hence a decline in aggregate demand for domestic output. Even much smaller shocks have had clearly visible effects on the U.S. economy  including the $5 dollar a barrel increase over 1996 and the $5 decline over 1997. Exchange rates move in response to both domestic and foreign economic developments and at times appear to move for reasons not clearly linked to economic fundamentals. The movements that are tied to changes in domestic economic fundamentals are BIS Review 95/1997 - 3 - part of the process of income and price determination in open economies  and I will have something to say about this below. But movements related to developments abroad or movements not clearly tied to economic fundamentals are another source of shock to national economies. This is especially important because the empirical linkages between exchange rates and fundamentals are weak  or not as well understood as we might like  so that movements in exchange rates often appear to be exaggerated relative to or seemingly unrelated to changes in fundamentals. Do cross-border capital flows reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy? One of the dimensions of increased openness is the rapid increase in the volume of cross-border capital flows. If foreign and domestic securities are perfect substitutes  the liberalization of cross-border financial transactions could  in principle  result in a single world financial market. This might appear to imply that the interest rate at which citizens and governments of a nation could borrow and lend would then be set on world markets  with little or at least limited influence by national policymakers. A small country  for example  would have no ability to influence world interest rates in this case. A very large country  such as the U.S.  would retain some influence  but the influence would be diminished relative to the closed-economy case and would result from its ability to affect the world interest rate. If a country’s exchange rate is pegged to the currency of another country (or countries)  then its interest rates will move closely in line with those in the country or group of countries to which it is pegged. But for countries with flexible exchange rates  domestic interest rates can move quite independently of interest rates abroad. However  if countries care about the level of their exchange rates  which have implications for aggregate demand and inflation  and adjust monetary policy accordingly  interest rates will  to a degree  move in common across countries. Greater integration of global capital markets does in fact mean that expected returns for holding different assets  with appropriate compensation for differences in risk  should increasingly converge. However  as long as exchange rates can adjust  this does not imply that interest rates across countries must move together. Instead  it is movements in exchange rates which insure convergence of holding period yields across the countries. Before turning to the connection between interest rates and exchange rates  let me note that the evidence does not confirm an increase in correlations in interest rate movements across world asset markets  at least in the 1990s compared to the 1980s. It is true that the levels of long-term interest rates in major industrial countries have tended to converge since the early 1980s. But this is largely accounted for by a convergence of inflation rates. On the other hand  there is little evidence to suggest that correlations between changes in long-term interest rates across these countries have increased over this period. These correlations are a little higher in the 1980s and 1990s than they were in the 1970s  but again have shown no tendency to increase since the early 1980s. At any rate  the correlations between U.S. interest rates and those of major industrial countries suggest that there remains ample room for real interest rates to move differently across the world financial markets and implies that domestic monetary policies remain important tools of macroeconomic policy  at least in countries with flexible exchange rates. While the correlations among changes in interest rates have not increased  changes in interest rates between the U.S. and major industrial counties are correlated. Correlations tend to be about 0.5. This leaves open the question of causality and source of the BIS Review 95/1997 - 4 - correlations. It does not mean that higher U.S. interest rates directly raise foreign interest rates by this amount. First  some of the co-movement could reflect synchronous business cycles. Second  some of the co-movement could reflect the spillover effects of a cycle in one country on aggregate demand and hence interest rates in the other countries. In addition  some of the correlation may reflect the effect of the response of monetary policy to exchange rate developments. Perhaps reflecting the latter influence  the correlation between interest rates in the United States and Canada is higher  about 0.8  while that between the United States and Europe is lower  about 0.4. The transmission mechanism in a open economy While cross-border capital flows do not interfere with the ability of U.S. monetary policy to influence the broad spectrum of interest rates in the United States  they do quickly transmit pressures from changes in U.S. interest rates to the exchange rate and thereby broaden the channels through which monetary policy affects aggregate demand. In the closed economy setting  the transmission mechanism runs from increases in the federal funds rate  the short-term interest rate targeted by monetary policy  first to longer-term interest rates and equity prices and then to aggregate demand. Several components of aggregate demand depend importantly on interest rates  particularly longer-term interest rates (specifically  business fixed investment  housing  spending on consumer durables); consumer spending also depends on the net wealth of households and is therefore affected by equity prices. Under floating exchange rates  net exports become another interest-sensitive component of aggregate demand. Higher U.S. (real) interest rates  relative to foreign rates  raise the demand for dollar-denominated assets  and bring about an appreciation of the dollar which  in turn  stimulates imports and restrains exports. Net exports as a result become inversely related to U.S. interest rates. Evidence suggests that the response of net exports to interest rates (via exchange rates) has become larger over time. The open economy version of the monetary policy transmission mechanism involves three steps: from U.S. interest rates to nominal exchange rates; from nominal exchange rates to the absolute and relative prices of imports and exports; and from the prices of imports and exports to the real volumes of imports and exports and domestic prices. From U.S. interest rates to the exchange rate We begin with the link between interest rates in the U.S. and exchange rates. A policy-initiated increase in U.S. short-term rates would  as noted above  generally result in higher U.S. long-term interest rates. At initial levels of foreign interest rates and equity prices  the movement in U.S. rates would make dollar-denominated assets more attractive compared to foreign currency-denominated assets  resulting in shifts in asset demands and either incipient or actual cross-border capital inflows to the U.S. and outflows from foreign economies. These shifts result in an appreciation of the dollar. Indeed  the single most important determinant of short-term movements in exchange rates is the change in real interest rate differentials across countries. A 1% point increase in U.S. long-term (10-year) interest rates  with unchanged foreign rates  will typically induce a 10% increase in the U.S. trade-weighted exchange rate. After the initial jump in the dollar  there will be an expectation of a decline in the dollar by about 1% each year for the next 10 years. The result of the rise in the dollar and the expectations of gradual reversal is what is BIS Review 95/1997 - 5 - referred to as international interest rate parity. The holding period yields of U.S. and foreign assets  each denominated in their home currency  are thereby equated  eliminating the incentive for further changes in asset demands or capital flows. That is  the higher interest rate yield on U.S. assets (measured in dollars) is just offset by the expected depreciation in the value of the asset  measured in the foreign currency. This is the mechanism by which holding period yields are equated across countries via international capital flows. By the end of the 10-year period  according to this framework  both interest rates and exchange rate would have returned to their original levels. Evidence suggests that the response of the exchange rate to changes in U.S. interest rates (relative to foreign rates) has increased over time. This likely reflects the removal of capital controls by many major industrial countries during the 1970s and early 1980s that in turn contributed the sharp rise in international capital flows documented above. So  increased integration of financial markets across countries appears to have had a more important effect in raising the responsiveness of exchange rates to interest rate developments than in directly connecting interest rates across countries. From the exchange rate to the relative prices of imports and exports The next step in the transmission mechanism is the pass-through of the exchange rate to the dollar prices of imports and the foreign currency price of U.S. exports. The evidence suggests that the pass-through is much more complete for U.S. exports than for imports  but there is no evidence that these pass-throughs have changed over time. An appreciation of the dollar will be gradually partially passed through over time to the price of imports  lowering their price relative to U.S. produced goods. The corresponding depreciation in other countries' currencies will result in a gradual increase in the foreign currency price of U.S. exports  compared to the prices of foreign produced goods. The result is movements in relative prices that encourage imports and discourage exports. From relative prices to real import and export volumes The final step in the process is from the relative price of imports and exports to the volumes of real imports and exports. This depends on the elasticity of the demands for imports and exports with respect to their relative prices and the size of trade flows relative to GDP. The elasticities of imports and exports with respect to their respective relative prices are estimated to be about unity  and there is no evidence of a shift in this elasticity over the past several decades. A one percentage point increase in the real exchange rate would increase real imports by one percentage point over a three-year period and decrease real exports by a similar percentage. The absolute effect on aggregate demand also depends on initial levels of imports and exports. As import and export volumes have been increasing rapidly  the absolute effect of exchange rate changes on aggregate demand and the contribution of the exchange rate channel to the monetary transmission mechanism has been growing over time. Trends in interest sensitivity If the magnitude of other channels in the transmission mechanism remained unchanged  the growing importance of imports and exports and the increase in the responsiveness of exchange rates to interest rate differentials would have raised the overall responsiveness of aggregate demand to interest rates. However  it appears that the interest sensitivity of residential construction has moderated over time  beginning with the repeal of Regulation Q  and continuing with innovations in housing finance  including adjustable rate BIS Review 95/1997 - 6 - mortgages  the broadening of the sources of mortgage lending  and the development of securitization and secondary markets for mortgages. The net result is that the interest responsiveness of aggregate demand appears to have remained reasonably stable over time  although the sectoral distribution of the overall effect of interest rates has shifted toward net exports and away from housing. The response of net exports to changes in U.S. interest rates  via exchange rates  contributes about one-third of the total interest sensitivity of U.S. aggregate demand over both a one-year and three-year interval. It is therefore a very important part of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. How does U.S. monetary policy affect other countries? Just as developments abroad affect the U.S. economy  changes in U.S. economic conditions impact on foreign economies  although the effects are not necessarily symmetric. Because of the large relative size of the U.S. economy  changes in U.S. economic conditions have relatively larger effects on foreign economies  compared to the effect of changing conditions in any one country abroad on the U.S. economy. A change in U.S. monetary policy affects foreign economies in three ways -- via exchange rates  interest rates  and income in the United States. The effects depend critically on the nature of the foreign exchange regime in the foreign country. If the foreign country’s currency is pegged to the dollar  for example  there will  of course  be no exchange rate effect vis-à-vis the United States. An increase in U.S. interest rates  however  would put downward pressure on the foreign currency and require the country to raise domestic interest rates to maintain the fixed exchange rate. Therefore  foreign interest rates are very likely to have to rise with U.S. rates in this case. The restraining effect of the rise in foreign interest rates will be reinforced by the effect of the deceleration in U.S. demand for foreign goods induced by the slowdown in U.S. income. As a result  a tightening of monetary policy is likely to have an unambiguously restrictive impact on those countries whose exchange rates are pegged to the dollar. For countries with floating exchange rates  on the other hand  the exchange rate and income effects of rising U.S. interest rates are likely to be offsetting. The appreciation of the dollar  of course  implies a depreciation in other countries’ exchange rates; the depreciation will stimulate foreign aggregate demand by raising net exports. Offsetting this will be the effect of the decline in U.S. income on the demand for foreign countries’ exports. The net effect  for countries with floating exchange rates  is likely to be small. That is  floating exchange rates tend to insulate a country from monetary shocks abroad. Other effects of globalization on the U.S. economy The increased openness of the U.S. economy has also focused attention on the possible effects of globalization on the macroeconomic performance of the U.S. economy  beyond the effects on the transmission of monetary policy that I have already addressed. I want to focus my attention in this section on the implications of globalization for wage-price dynamics because this has a direct bearing on the conduct of monetary policy. Some have argued that increased global competition has made the United States (and presumably other countries) less inflation prone  so that the U.S. economy can operate at a higher degree of resource utilization without the threat of rising inflation. BIS Review 95/1997 - 7 - It is useful to distinguish three ways in which global developments might recently be contributing to restraining inflation in the United States. First  the significant appreciation of the dollar over the last two years has clearly had an important restraining effect on U.S. inflation  both via the direct effect on the prices of imported goods and on the pricing power of domestic firms producing import-competing goods. Second  the absence of synchronous expansions among the major industrial countries -- specifically the much weaker expansions in continental Europe and the still weaker condition of the Japanese economy -- has prevented the pressures on worldwide commodity markets that often accompany U.S. expansions and has perhaps also encouraged greater price competitiveness than would otherwise have been the case. Third  increased international competitive pressures  associated with growing openness of the U.S. economy  might be restraining inflation. But I wonder whether we would be talking about the contribution of globalization to U.S. inflation performance if the dollar had been stable for the last several years and the expansions in Europe and Japan were as robust as in the U.S. I doubt it. Are there additional objectives for monetary policy in a global environment? An interesting question is whether the increased openness of the U.S. and other economies suggests new objectives for domestic monetary policies. It is certainly true that increased globalization has encouraged a proliferation of information-sharing exercises around the world and some increased attention to the coordination of policies across countries. I will comment on this briefly below. Let’s start with objectives appropriate in the closed economy context. Congress has set dual objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act: price stability and full employment. These objectives relate directly to the performance of the domestic economy and they are also objectives that monetary policy has the ability to pursue in the closed economy setting. The first question is whether the open economy environment reduces the ability of domestic monetary policy to achieve these objectives. I have argued that globalization has not reduced the ability of countries with flexible exchange rates to carry out independent monetary policies and therefore pursue domestic objectives. On the other hand  countries that fix exchange rates do give up much of the independence in their domestic monetary policies. The second issue is whether the open economy setting introduces new objectives  beyond those that motivate policy in the closed economy context. Three possibilities come to mind: the current account and/or trade balance  the exchange rate (or pattern in exchange rates around the world)  and economic performance abroad. Even thinking of the external measures as domestic objectives raises questions. With respect to the current account  we should begin by separating cyclical and structural movements. Cyclical movements in net exports contribute the economy’s built-in stability and are therefore quite desirable. Changes in the structural current account balance may contribute to or interfere with broader domestic objectives  depending on circumstances. The fundamental source of a structural current account deficit is domestic spending in excess of domestic production. Is this good or bad? The answer is: it depends. An excess of spending over production used to finance business fixed investment could have a payoff in terms of higher future output large enough to service the increased international indebtedness and still leave the country better off. An increase in the current account deficit as a result of increased private or public consumption would  in contrast  require lower future consumption as some of future BIS Review 95/1997 - 8 - production would have to be used to service the higher level of foreign debt. In addition  there is an issue of sustainability. International indebtedness can become so large in relation to current production  depending in part on the relationship between the real interest rate on foreign debt and the economy’s trend rate of growth  that the current account deficit could increase explosively. If the current account is an objective  durable changes in the structural deficit can only be achieved by fiscal policy. A cut in the structural federal budget deficit for example would increase national saving  lower real interest rates  lead to a depreciation of the dollar  boost net exports  and lower the current account deficit. It is even more difficult to talk about the exchange rate as an objective. The exchange rate is  after all  basically a relative price. We might say that we prefer that an exchange rate that reflect fundamentals. But other than that the exchange rate is a symptom  rather than an outcome. If the current account deficit is wide because of a high dollar  the appropriate question is why is the dollar so high. If the answer is because the federal budget structural deficit is high and has raised real interest rates in the U.S.  the offender is not the exchange rate  but the federal budget deficit. If the problem with exchange rates is fundamentals  then it is the fundamentals that need to be changed. Monetary policy can  via its effect on interest rates  influence exchange rates in the short run. But  for monetary policy to target exchange rates  it must give reduced weight to its domestic objectives. When fundamentals are the issue  it is the mix of monetary and fiscal policies that must answer the call. Stabilization policy  for example  calls for a level of aggregate demand consistent with full employment. That level of aggregate demand can be produced by a variety of combinations of monetary and fiscal policies  varying from a very tight fiscal and loose monetary policy to a tight monetary and loose fiscal policy. The difference among these options is interest rates. If fiscal policy  for example  moves to a higher deficit  monetary policy will have to offset the effect on aggregate demand by tightening. The result is higher interest rate  a higher dollar  and ultimately a wider current account deficit. If this outcome is viewed as undesirable  the way to unwind it is by lowering the deficit  accompanied by more accommodative monetary policy. It takes two to do this tango! But I always view fiscal policy as having the first move. Monetary policy’s job is to follow the lead of fiscal  so that the resulting mix is appropriate to the requirements of stabilization policy. I am occasionally asked whether I worry about the effect on other countries of changes in U.S. monetary policy. While I do keep in mind the potential international repercussions of U.S. monetary policy actions  I believe that the best way for the U.S. to contribute to the health of the world economy is to pursue prudent domestic policy and achieve maximum sustainable employment and price stability and accommodate the maximum sustainable growth in the U.S. economy. Are there new policy instruments in a global economy? Another question about the conduct of monetary policy in an open economy is whether the open economy offers monetary policy a new instrument that it did not have in the closed economy world. In a closed economy context  monetary policy has a single instrument: open market operations  used to target a short-term interest rate. BIS Review 95/1997 - 9 - The obvious candidate for an additional instrument in the open economy case is the exchange rate. I have already argued that monetary policy cannot be used to target the exchange rate. The issue here is whether there are opportunities to exercise direct control of the exchange rate. The obvious option is intervention. Intervention refers to a government buying or selling foreign currency in order to influence the exchange rate. One can identify two reasons for intervening. The first is to calm disorderly markets. That is  an increase in volatility in the foreign exchange market might be damped by intervention. However  most intervention is about affecting the level of the exchange rate  not its volatility  though the rhetoric of disorderly markets often is employed to justify the action. Actions to affect the level can be intended to prevent a further decline (or increase) or to encourage a change in the level. With a daily volume of $1.2 trillion in the foreign exchange markets  and underlying stocks of financial assets that are substantially larger  there is ground for skepticism that intervention  which seldom ranges into the billions of dollars in daily volume  can have more than a marginal and transitory effect. Still  there are examples of modest “successes ” especially when intervention is coordinated across countries and well timed. The major opportunity for intervention to succeed is when the exchange rate has diverged to a significant degree from fundamentals and the intervention induces a reconsideration of the market or a re- focus of the market on fundamentals. The management of foreign exchange interventions varies around the world. In the United States  this management is shared by the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury Department. In principle  intervention can be initiated by either party  although when the Treasury opts to intervene it is the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that actually does the buying or selling of foreign currency  albeit from an account held in the name of Treasury and at the direction of Treasury. Similarly  when the FOMC makes a decision to intervene  it directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to do so  from the account in the name of the Federal Reserve System. The traditional practice is that U.S. intervention exercises are carried out jointly  half from the Federal Reserve’s account and half from the Treasury’s account. However  in principle  either party could intervene on its own. International information exchange  policy coordination  and crisis management Given the growing interdependence of national economies and macroeconomic policies  the coordination of (or more accurately  mutual consultation about) these policies has taken on increased importance. The Federal Reserve takes part in many international forums to exchange information on economic developments and discuss global economic issues. Examples include the 10 meetings each year among G-10 central bank Governors  under the auspices of the BIS; the twice a year meetings of the Economic Policy Committee of the OECD  meetings of the G-7  IMF  and regional meetings  such as APEC and Governors of the Central Banks of the American Continent. In addition to discussions about the performance of the various economies and global macroeconomic issues  there are also ongoing discussions about international crisis management and a growing interest in global standards for risk management in financial institutions and for cooperation in sharing information about the performance and risk profiles of internationally active financial conglomerates.

I welcome the opportunity to inaugurate your economic seminar series because I believe that the education community has a crucial role to play in the current era of rapid economic change. Our businesses and workers are confronting a dynamic set of forces that will influence our nation’s ability to compete worldwide in the years ahead. Our success in preparing workers and managers to harness those forces will be an important element in the outcome. One of the most central dynamic forces is the accelerated expansion of computer and telecommunications technologies  which can be reasonably expected to appreciably raise our standard of living in the twenty-first century. In the short run  however  fast-paced technological change creates an environment in which the stock of plant and equipment with which most managers and workers interact is turning over more rapidly  creating a perception that human skills are becoming obsolete at a rate perhaps unprecedented in American history. I shall endeavor to place this most unusual phenomenon in the context of the broader changes in our economy and  I hope  to explain why education  especially to enhance advanced skills  is so vital to the future growth of our economy. Wealth has always been created  virtually by definition  when individuals use their growing knowledge to interact with an expanding capital stock to produce goods and services of value. Assisted by the whole array of market prices  entrepreneurs seek to identify the types of products and services that individuals will value. More specifically  they seek the added value that customers place on products and services tailored to their particular needs  delivered in shorter time frames  or improved in quality. A century ago  much  if not most  of our effort was expended in producing food  clothing  and shelter. Only when crop yields increased  steam power was developed  and textile fabrication became more efficient were available work hours freed for the production and consumption of more discretionary goods and services. We manufactured cars and refrigerators and learned how to produce them with ever less human effort. As those products found their way into most homes  human effort moved on to the creation of values that were less constrained by limits of physical bulk  such as smaller  transistor-based electronics  and beyond to a wide variety of impalpable services -- medical care  education  entertainment  and travel  to name just a few. The demand for a virtually infinite array of impalpable values is  to a first approximation  insatiable. Understandably  today’s efforts to create new values for consumers concentrates on these impalpables  which offer the highest potential value-added relative to costs in physical resources and human effort. Unbundling the particular characteristics of each good or service facilitates maximizing its value to each individual. Some individuals place more value on  and are willing to pay more for  style y rather than style x  whereas others prefer x. Producing both x and y enhances overall consumer well-being. Fifty years ago  only x was feasible. This striving to expand the options for satisfying the particular needs of individuals inevitably results in a shift toward value created through the exploitation of ideas and concepts -- or  more generally  information -- from the more straightforward utilization of physical resources and manual labor. BIS Review 95/1997 - 2 - Thus  it should come as no surprise that  over the past century  by far the largest part of the growth in America’s real gross domestic product is the result of new insights and  more broadly  new information about how to rearrange physical reality to achieve ever-higher standards of living. The amount of physical input into our real GDP  measured in bulk or weight  has contributed only modestly to economic growth since the turn of the century. We have  for example  dramatically reduced the physical bulk of our radios  by substituting transistors for vacuum tubes. Thin fiber optic cable has replaced huge tonnages of copper wire. New architectural  engineering  and materials technologies have enabled the construction of buildings enclosing the same amount of space  but with far less physical material than was required  say  50 or 100 years ago. Most recently  mobile phones have become significantly downsized as they have been improved. As it became technologically possible to differentiate output to meet the increasingly calibrated choices that consumers now regularly make  the value of information creation and its transfer was expanded. Hence  it is understandable that our advanced computer and telecommunications products have been accorded particularly high value and  thus  why computer and telecommunications companies that successfully innovate in this field exhibit particularly elevated stock market values. Breakthroughs in all areas of technology are continually adding to the growing list of almost wholly conceptual elements in our economic output. These developments are affecting how we produce output and are demanding greater specialized knowledge. We could expect the widespread and effective application of information and other technologies to significantly increase productivity and reduce business costs. Certainly  we can already see dramatic improvements in quality control that have sharply reduced costly product rejects and lost time  while computer and satellite technology has markedly improved the efficiencies of moving goods through even more sophisticated  just-in-time  inventory systems. With computer-assisted design  experiments can be evaluated in a virtual reality setting  where mistakes can be readily corrected without the misuse of time and materials. And new technologies have had extensive applications in the services sector -- for example  in health services  where improvements in both diagnosis and treatment have been singularly impressive; in airline efficiency and safety; and in secretarial services now dominated by word processing  faxes  and voice and electronic mail. The accelerated pace of technological advance has also interacted with the rapid rise in financial innovation  with the result that business services and financial transactions now are transmitted almost instantaneously across global networks. Financial instruments have become increasingly diverse  products more customized  and markets more intensely competitive. The scope and size of our financial sector has grown rapidly because of its ability to facilitate the financing of products and services that are themselves valued highly in the marketplace. Our nation’s financial institutions  as a consequence  are endeavoring to find more effective and efficient ways to deliver their services. In this environment  America’s prospects for economic growth will depend greatly on our capacity to develop and to apply new technology. Unfortunately  we have found that we never can predict with any precision which particular technology or synergies of technologies will add significantly to our knowledge and our ability to gain from that knowledge. For instance  Alexander Graham Bell initially viewed the telephone solely as a business instrument -- merely an enhancement of the telegraph for use in transmitting very specific messages. Indeed  he offered to sell his telephone patent to Western Union for only BIS Review 95/1997 - 3 - $100 000  but he was turned down. Similarly  Marconi  at first  overlooked the radio’s value as a public broadcast medium  instead believing its principal application would be in the transmission of point-to-point messages  such as ship-to-ship  where communication by wire was infeasible. Moreover  we must recognize that an innovation’s full potential may be realized only after extensive improvements or after complementary innovations in other fields of science. According to Charles Townes  a Nobel Prize winner for his work on the laser  the attorneys for Bell Labs initially  in the late 1960s  refused to patent the laser because they believed it had no applications in the field of telecommunications. Only in the 1980s  after extensive improvements in fiber optics technology  did the laser’s importance for telecommunications become apparent. America’s continued success in garnering the benefits of technological advance will depend on the ability of our businesses to deal with risk and uncertainty. Moreover  our ability to remain in the forefront of new ideas and products will be ever more difficult because of the rapid international diffusion of technology. Nonetheless  to date  we have not fallen behind in converting scientific and technological breakthroughs into viable commercial products. Even if the most recent  tentative indications that productivity growth may be speeding up were to turn out to be less than we had hoped  it is possible that the big increases in efficiency growing out of the introduction of computers and communications systems may still lie ahead. Past innovations  such as the advent of electricity or the invention of the gasoline-powered motor  required the development of considerable infrastructure before their full potential could be realized. Electricity  when it substituted for steam power late last century  was applied to production processes that had been developed for steam. For example  gravity was used to move goods vertically in the steam environment  and that setup did not initially change with the advent of electric power. Only much later -- when horizontal factories  newly designed for optimal use of electric power  began to dominate our industrial system -- did productivity clearly accelerate. Similarly  only when highways and gasoline service stations became extensive was the lower cost of motor vehicle transportation achieved. In addition  full effectiveness in realizing the gains from technological advance will require a considerable amount of human investment on the part of managers and workers who have to implement new processes and who must be prepared to adapt  over their lifetimes  to the ongoing change that innovations bring. The growth of the conceptual component of output has brought with it accelerating demands for workers who are equipped not simply with technical know-how  but with the ability to create  analyze  and transform information and to interact effectively with others. A popular term for the type of human capital that firms are today employing to a greater degree is “functional literacy ”1 which perhaps sounds deceptively simple when one considers the complex of attributes necessary to transform information into economic value. Indeed  the debate about whether the introduction of technology would upgrade or “deskill” the workforce is as old as Adam Smith. Certainly  one can point to some very routine 1 Frederic L. Pryor and David Schaffer  “Wages and the University Educated: A Paradox Resolved ” Monthly Labor Review (July 1997)  pp. 3-14. BIS Review 95/1997 - 4 - types of jobs  such as those for telephone operators  that have lower skill requirements in today’s world of automated communications systems than when more labor-intensive manual phone systems were in place. But  on the whole  the evidence suggests that across a wide range of industries  employers have upgraded their skill mix2. Importantly  these changes represent not simply a shift in the occupational mix  but  to a larger degree  an upgrading of skill requirements of individual jobs for which the range and complexity of tasks and the scope for problem-solving and decision-making has expanded. This process appears to have occurred more rapidly in those businesses with greater computer utilization3. However  this is not to argue that growing use of technology alone can explain the accelerated demand for more skilled workers. A 1994 survey of employers conducted by the Census Bureau for the National Center on the Educational Quality of the Workforce found that rising skill requirements also are more common in firms that have introduced more flexible production systems  adopted team management practices  or reduced the layers of management in the organization. More generally  at the root of both the rise in the demand for workers who embody greater human capital and the increasing application of technology is the realization by businesses that remaining competitive in today’s world requires unprecedented flexibility to adapt to change. Traditionally  broader human capital skills have been associated with higher education  and  accordingly  the demand for college-trained workers has been increasing rapidly. The result is that  over the past 15 years  a wide gap has opened up between the earnings of college graduates and those of workers who stopped their formal schooling with a high-school diploma or less. But the dispersion of pay outcomes has also increased within groups of workers with the same levels of education  which suggests that broader cognitive skills and conceptual abilities have become increasingly important on a wide scale  and that basic credentials  by themselves  are not enough to ensure success in the workplace. Clearly our educational institutions will continue to play an important role in preparing workers to meet these demands. And  responding to the strong signals that the returns to formal education have been rising  the supply of college-trained labor has been increasing. School enrollment rates among traditional college-age young people  which were little changed in the 1970s  have moved up sharply since then. At the same time  enrollment rates have picked up noticeably among individuals aged 25 and over. Presumably  many of these older students are striving to keep pace with the new demands evolving in the job market. Indeed  an important aspect of the changing nature of jobs appears to be that an increasing number of workers are facing the likelihood that they will need retooling during their careers. The notion that formal degree programs at any level can be crafted to fully support the requirements of one’s lifework is being challenged. As a result  education is increasingly becoming a lifelong activity; businesses are now looking for employees who are prepared to continue learning  and workers and managers in many kinds of pursuits have begun to recognize that maintaining their human capital will require persistent hard work and flexibility. 2 Peter Cappelli  “Are Skilling Requirements Rising? Evidence from Production and Clerical Jobs ” Industrial and Labor Relations Review (April 1993)  pp. 515-530; and “Technology and Skill Requirements: Implications for Establishment Wage Structures ” New England Economic Review  Special Issue on Earnings and Inequality (May/June  1996)  pp. 139-154. 3 David H. Autor  Lawrence F. Katz  and Alan B. Krueger  “Computing Inequality: Have Computers Changed the Labor Market ” National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 5956 (March 1997). BIS Review 95/1997 - 5 - Economists have long argued that more than half of the market human capital produced in a worker’s lifetime is produced on the job4. Several decades ago  much of that on-the-job training was acquired through work experience; today we are seeing greater emphasis on the value of formal education and training programs for workers. Developing human capital is perceived by many corporations as adding to shareholder value. If idea creation is increasingly the factor that engenders value-added  then training and education are crucial to the growth of company value-added and profitability. In the private sector  a number of major corporations have invested in their own internal training centers -- so-called corporate universities. Some labor unions have done the same. More broadly  recent surveys by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and by the Department of Education indicate that the provision of education on the job has risen markedly in recent years. In 1995  the BLS report showed that 70 percent of workers in establishments with 50 or more employees received some formal training during the twelve months preceding the survey. Most often this training was conducted in house by company personnel  but larger firms also relied to a great extent on educational institutions. The information collected by the Department of Education indicated that the percentage of employed individuals who took courses specifically to improve their current job skills rose between 1991 and 1995; by 1995  four of every ten full-time workers aged 35 to 54 had sought to upgrade their skills. The survey shows that growing proportions of workers with a high-school education or less and of those in production and craft jobs sought additional training; however  college graduates and those in professional occupations still reported the highest incidence of additional coursework -- almost 50 percent. Thus  learning does seem to beget perhaps both a capacity as well as a desire for more learning. This finding should underscore the need to begin the learning process as early as possible. In the long run  better child-rearing and better basic education at the elementary and secondary school levels are essential to providing the foundation for a lifetime of learning. At the same time  we must be alert to the need to improve the skills and earning power of those who appear to be falling behind. We must also develop strategies to overcome the education deficiencies of all too many of our young people and to renew the skills of workers who have not kept up with the changing demands of the workplace. The recognition that more productive workers and learning go hand-in-hand is becoming ever more visible in schools and in the workplace. Expanded linkages between business and education should be encouraged at all levels of our education system. Building bridges between our educational institutions and the private business sector should have payoffs in how well graduates are prepared to meet the challenges of an increasingly knowledge-based global economy. Indeed  a recent study argues that we need not rely on colleges and universities to teach “the new basic skills” to prepare workers for jobs in a knowledge-based economy; that foundation could be built in high schools if only more high schools were to ensure that graduates left with not only essential basic reading and computational skills  but also with training in how to solve semi-structured problems  how to make oral presentations  and how to work in diverse groups5. Those researchers argue for a better connection between secondary school curricula and business needs -- “vocational education” in a very broad sense rather than the traditional narrow one. 4 Jacob Mincer  “On the Job Training: Costs  Returns  and Some Implications ” Journal of Political Economy  vol. 70  Supplement (October 1962)  pp. 50-79; and James Heckman  Lance Lochner  and Christopher Taber  “Estimating and Evaluating Human Capital Policies in a General Equilibrium Environment” (Working Paper  University of Chicago  1997). 5 Richard J. Murnane and Frank Levy  Teaching the New Basic Skills: Principles for Educating Children to Thrive in a Changing Economy (The Free Press  1997). BIS Review 95/1997 - 6 - While many debate how to make our elementary and secondary schools more effective in preparing students -- particularly compared with those in other developed countries -- there is little question about the quality of our university system  which for decades has attracted growing numbers of students from abroad. The payoff to advanced training remains high  and even with higher rates of enrollment  the supply of college-trained labor does not appear likely to outstrip the growing demands of a rapidly changing economy. The linkages between the private sector and our colleges and universities have a long tradition  and many schools are endeavoring to extend those connections. Your university’s plans for the Connecticut Information Technology Institute embodies this reality. You and your partners in the business community clearly appreciate the mutual benefits that will accrue as technologically advanced learning is grounded in real-world curricula -- beginning with students and continuing for workers seeking to renew their skills. The advent of the twenty-first century will certainly bring new challenges and new possibilities for our businesses  our workers  and our educational system. We cannot know the precise directions in which technological change will take us. As in the past  our economic institutions and our workforce will strive to adjust  but we must recognize that adjustment is not automatic. All shifts in the structure of the economy naturally create frictions and human stress  at least temporarily. However  if we are able to boost our investment in people  ideas  and processes as well as in machines  the economy can readily adapt to change  and support ever-rising standards of living.

Rangarajan  at a special convocation held to confer upon him the honorary title of Fellow of the Indian Institute of Management at Ahmedabad on 3/10/97. It gives me immense pleasure to be on the campus of the Indian Institute of Management. I accept in all humility the award of the title “Fellow of the Indian Institute of Management”  Ahmedabad. What can be a greater honour than the recognition by one’s own peers and family? I look back with immense satisfaction on the years that I spent on the campus here. Those fourteen years marked the most productive period of my academic life. It is no mean task to have created here an institution of world-class excellence. All those who have been associated with IIMA can take legitimate pride in this achievement. This  however  makes the task of the current faculty members and students even harder. The race of excellence is a perpetual one and is  therefore  very demanding. I am sure that IIMA will always remain ahead. We are celebrating this year the Golden Jubilee of India’s Independence. As a nation  we have accomplished much during this period. We have moved from the status of dependent country stricken at periodic intervals by famine and shortages to that of an independent nation with a high degree of stability. But the unfinished agenda is still long. Our rate of growth  though high in relation to our own performance in the previous fifty years  has fallen short of our expectations and that of what certain other countries have been able to achieve. The miracle of East Asian countries may to some extent have been dimmed by the recent crises in these countries. Nevertheless  they have shown that it is possible for countries to grow at a sustained rate of 7 per cent or more for several decades. We need to set our goals high. We have over time created the wherewithal for progress. The real task today is to use these advantages for further growth. All of us are conditioned by history. History is a great teacher if we can draw appropriate lessons. The present is an extension of the past. We should not  however  become prisoners of the past. Where changes are called for  we must be willing to make them. It is only by making such changes that a nation can progress. In the recent period we have made some basic changes in our approach to economic development and the means to achieve the desired results. The fundamental objectives of economic development in our country remain the same: growth and social justice. Instrumentalities to achieve these will have to change in tune with our experience and according to the demands of the time and the responses of the society. In bringing about faster growth we need to address many issues. Perhaps one that is most relevant in the context of work that is going on at IIMA is the issue of productivity. In ensuring a higher growth rate  there is no doubt that we must bring about an increase in the saving rate and  consequently  the investment rate. But at the same time one cannot over-emphasise the need for improving the productivity and efficiency of input use. Economists in fact talk about total factor productivity  which identifies the contribution to the increase in output of influences other than increase in factor inputs. The total factor productivity growth thus encompasses the effect not only of technological progress but also of better utilisation of capacities  improved skills of labour  etc. In fact during the period 1960-87 the total factor productivity growth of East Asia was 1.9 per cent per productivity and efficiency. Contrary to the general impression  the natural resources of our country are not large. From the point of view of long-range sustainability  the need for greater efficiency in the management of natural resources of land  water  minerals  etc. has become urgent. In a capital-scarce economy like ours  there can be no excuse for under-utilisation of capacity. Macro-policy framework and micro-management practices must be such as to bring about the desired increase in productivity. While the policy framework must be supportive  industrial structure must be such as to compel firms to continually innovate and to cut costs. The policy environment  the organisational structure and the attitude to work and technology: all these have to be right. Needless to say  institutes of management have an important role to play in bringing about this improvement in productivity by sharpening the skills and the vision of managers. BIS Review 96/1997 - 2 - The recent development experience has clearly shown that countries which have grown fast are those which have made very heavy investment in education. Even as we aim at creating a broad-based educational system  including compulsory education at the primary and secondary levels  we also need institutions of excellence. Living as we are in a complex and globally competitive world  institutions of excellence in all disciplines are required to meet the challenges of competition  which in effect is the competition in skills and techniques. We are living in a fast-changing world. One analyst has compared these changes to the movement of the continental plates under the surface of the earth -- “plate tectonics” as geologists call it. The same analyst has also compared the dramatic changes using an analogy from evolutionary biology: “punctuated equilibrium”. In these periods  the environment undergoes such significant changes that the dominant species is replaced by another one and evolution takes a quantum leap. Whether such a description fits the changes that are occurring today  history alone can tell. There is  however little doubt that we are living in exciting times. India missed the first Industrial Revolution. We cannot afford to miss the second one. All of our institutions of higher learning have an important responsibility in this regard. IIM  Ahmedabad has played a major role in improving the managerial practices in this country in the last three decades. In the current phases of industrial development  when Indian firms are subject to competitive forces  both domestic and global  the role of IIM is even greater. If the past is any guide  I am sure it will fulfil this historic role. BIS Review 96/1997

What I have to say is based in the main on the Riksbank’s latest inflation report  which was published less than a month ago. In some respects  I shall be developing what we said there about the outlook for inflation  though our assessment of the situation is essentially unchanged. I shall begin  however  with some remarks about why monetary policy is constructed as it is  with the objective of safeguarding the value of money. 1. Monetary policy’s foundations Experience advocates a stable environment The reason why the Riksbank’s objective is to safeguard the value of money is basically simple: low  stable inflation contributes to a good environment for the growth of production and employment. Support for this view is readily found in the pattern of economic developments in different industrialised countries. In those countries where inflation has been allowed to accelerate  growth has normally been weaker and more erratic. We have seen this in Sweden. In the first two-to-three post-war decades Swedish economic policy was characterised by stable rules and inflation was low. Economic growth in those years was good and new jobs were created to a greater extent than in the past two decades  when inflation shot up and there was a series of devaluation cycles. There is really nothing odd about this. We all know that stable conditions make it easier to arrive at wise economic decisions. When wages and prices chase each other in an unpredictable way  and both interest rates and the exchange rate fluctuate widely as a result of this  with a certain amount of luck or smartness it is sometimes possible to do good business. But most people surely realise that this is not the best setting for either long-term investment or for those who have to live on an earned income or a pension. The head of the US Federal Reserve  Alan Greenspan  has formulated his view of what monetary policy’s objective should be in roughly these words: inflation should be so low that economic agents do not have to worry about it. Limited room for employment policy Why  then  are there those who still argue that higher inflation would be a good thing? I believe this is mainly because they perceive a conflict between price stability and low unemployment. This perception in turn has its roots in a short-run  cyclical perspective. When economic activity is rising or falling on account of transitory demand fluctuations around a long-term trend  this negative relationship does exist. Rising demand for goods and services generates increased demand for labour and lower unemployment; this tends to be accompanied by rising wages and higher inflation. The opposite also applies. But this does not mean that higher inflation results in permanently higher employment and lastingly lower unemployment. On the contrary  as a result of the economic setback that normally follows a return to an inflation economy  unemployment is liable to rise even higher. Against this it might be argued that it is not a matter of giving inflation its head  but of allowing just a little more inflation. Nor is it a matter of doing this as a systematic policy  but just for once. Once again  the Swedish experience in the 1970s and 1980s is both instructive and representative of what has happened in many other countries. A little more inflation over a short period can very easily become inflation that is high and persistent. BIS Review 96/1997 - 2 - In any event  in the longer run the level of unemployment is determined by factors other than the demand situation  factors such as institutions  rules and conventions in the economy and above all in the labour market and wage formation. If the causes of unemployment were in fact solely or even mainly cyclical  then unemployment would not differ so greatly as it does between countries that are in the same cyclical phase and have had much the same growth rate for a long time. Targeting inflation The Riksbank has the objective of safeguarding the value of money. In practice  the Riksbank targets inflation. The target rate is 2 per cent (with a tolerance interval of – 1 percentage point)  assessed in annual terms. As there is a time lag of 1 to 2 years before an interest rate adjustment has its full effect on the rate of price increases  the Riksbank has to work with forecast inflation. When we have reason to fear that inflation is rising above the targeted rate  it will soon be time to raise the instrumental rate and vice versa. Assessments of future inflation are presented by the Riksbank four times a year in the series of inflation reports. The assessments are published as a guide to economic agents in their own deliberations about what the future level of interest rates is likely to be. The reports also provide a basis for the discussion of monetary policy’s construction that the Riksbank is interested in encouraging. Simplifying somewhat  inflation is determined by two factors: the situation concerning demand and supply and economic agents’ expectations of future inflation. The first factor is fairly straightforward; when demand tends to exceed what the economy is capable of producing  the resultant shortages and bottlenecks will normally push prices and wages up. The part played by expectations may be less evident. If firms and employees expect increased inflation  they will tend to raise prices and demand higher wages  respectively. This may be sufficient to start and continue an inflationary process. Another factor of importance for inflation is the value of the krona  both because it directly affects pricing and demand and because it can serve as an indication of expected inflation. 2. Economic activity and inflation expectations Now for the assessment in our latest inflation report. First let me say something about the Riksbank’s appraisal of the economic situation. Demand and supply The statistics from recent months clearly point to an upswing in the greater part of the economy. This largely confirms the Riksbank’s assessments last spring. Developments to date in 1997 have been more balanced than before. Demand growth is now coming not only from exports and investment  but to an increasing extent from private consumption as well. The growth of household income has been held back for some years by the programme for fiscal consolidation. Activity has been further depressed by the need to cut spending on public activities. The fiscal withdrawal of household purchasing power is continuing both this year and next  so disposable income is largely unchanged in 1997  but will rise in 1998. After that  when the consolidation programme has been completed  fiscal policy is not expected to be as restrictive on households. Some increase in public activities can also be expected in the coming two years. After rising for some years at a rather modest rate  private consumption has picked up in the past year. Households’ expectations concerning their own as well as the national economy improved in September after a minor setback in August. Households are also more optimistic about the outlook in the labour market. Moreover  the August survey by the National Institute of Economic Research shows that firms in both everyday and infrequent trade are optimistic about sales trends in the near future. BIS Review 96/1997 - 3 - It is not just disposable income that determines private consumption. The appreciation of wealth in the past year is probably important  too. Since the turn of 1996  house prices have risen 9 per cent and share prices 28 per cent. This suggests that in 1997 households could realise capital gains that may reach the equivalent of about 25 per cent of disposable income. It would be surprising if such an increase in wealth did not contribute to stronger consumer demand. To sum up  most signs point to a good development of demand in the years ahead. In an expanding world market  export growth should continue to be relatively high. The Riksbank also counts on an accelerating increase in private consumption and at least an end to the fall in public consumption. The broad increase in all the major demand components naturally exerts some pressure on the available resources. This implies rising capacity utilisation and a decreased availability of unutilised resources. The business tendency surveys for manufacturing  which provide information about capacity there  consistently indicate that unutilised resources fell from the first to the second quarter. An increased proportion of firms reported that output was being restricted by production factors rather than demand. This was accompanied by rising shortages of skilled workers and salaried technicians. An important  though elusive  indicator of inflationary pressure is the gap between total demand and total output. Most indicators suggest that this gap has become somewhat smaller. In the inflation report  however  the Riksbank judges that the supply of unutilised resources is still relatively good. It is not least the high level of total unemployment that indicates this. A high rate of investment and rapid increases in productivity have contributed  at least to date  to an expansion of potential output to meet the growing demand. This has eased inflationary pressure during the upswing. Inflation expectations Another important indicator of inflationary pressure is the expectations of economic agents about future inflation. Along with actual inflation  these expectations have declined in recent years. They also show a tendency to converge around the 2 per cent inflation target. If this is the case  it is a good sign because it can be seen as increased confidence in the inflation target. This means that to a greater extent  economic agents are basing their own plans on expectations of low inflation  which provides better conditions for monetary policy to fulfil the inflation target. In recent months the expectations of future inflation have tended to move up  but this seems to be mainly an adjustment to the increase in registered inflation. The tendency  however  must be closely watched; a clear increase in inflation expectations above the inflation target would give cause for concern. 3. Inflation in the coming years In the course of 1996 CPI inflation decreased markedly and the annual level was somewhat below the lower limit of the tolerance interval. Transitory factors partly explain the drop. Falling house mortgage interest costs  occasioned in part by the Riksbank’s own interest rate cuts  played a large part in the low inflation figures. The trend has now turned and the rate of inflation is beginning to move up. But the main reason for this is that the transient downward factors are no longer at work to the same degree; the increase in underlying inflation is therefore more subdued. In the light of the assessments of economic activity and other factors that affect inflation (e.g. inflation expectations)  in the inflation report the Riksbank forecast that annual CPI inflation would be around 1 per cent in 1997 and around 2 per cent in both 1998 and 1999. Some acceleration was envisaged in the latter two years. The assessment carried some reservations. Matters discussed in the report included the risks associated with rising activity  the difficulties in knowing how the supply side would react and the BIS Review 96/1997 - 4 - coming round of wage negotiations. There may be reasons for elaborating on that discussion in some respects. Output gap closing by degrees In the inflation report the Riksbank considers that Sweden’s gross domestic product will grow by around 2 per cent in 1997 and around 3 per cent in 1998. In 1999 the GDP growth rate is expected to be rather more than 3 per cent. This implies that in 1998 and 1999 growth will be stronger than the increase in potential output  for which the annual trend is estimated to be just over 2 per cent. That means that today’s surplus capacity will be activated by degrees. It is difficult to tell how quickly this will happen. The Riksbank considers that the output gap -- a way of attempting to gauge unutilised capacity in the economy as a whole -- is currently about 2 per cent of GDP. With the growth rates envisaged above  the gap would then close some time in 1999. Other information with a bearing on when inflation might be likely to accelerate was also included in the inflation report. Estimates of structural unemployment and thereby  indirectly  of the level of unemployment that can be combined with stable  low inflation  suggest that risks of inflation also exist less than two years ahead. The rate at which capacity utilisation rises may likewise play a part. A rapid reduction of unutilised resources might generate inflationary impulses even though there is still a capacity surplus at total level. Risks in the wage negotiations Wage formation is particularly relevant at present because the settlements that are due in the coming six months will cover a large part of the labour market. Labour shortages are not yet being reported from more than a few sectors  but experience shows that the domino effects can be substantial. The Riksbank’s assessment of inflation in the latest report is based on an assumption that the rate of wage increases will be lower than in recent years. Support for this assumption can be found  for example  in recent wage statistics. The report  however  does not envisage a downward shift to  or even below  the level that has prevailed in the European Union in recent years  a shift that would make it easier for Sweden to tackle unemployment. Wage formation is primarily a matter for the labour market organisations to arrange. The level of wage increases that different segments of the economy can cope with depends  for example  on the initial profit level  together with the development of that segment’s productivity  costs and prices. For the economy as a whole it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that  if an effective reduction of unemployment is to be feasible  a rate of wage increases which equals the inflation target plus expected long-term productivity growth represents a ceiling. Lower wage increases would make labour cheaper relative to capital investment and would thereby stimulate employment. It is important to understand today’s rules for economic policy. In keeping with the situation a quarter of a century ago  when Sweden was participating in the Bretton Woods system  which was a functional and efficient arrangement with fixed exchange rates  for some years now the rules of the game have been clear. If the Riksbank judges that inflation will rise above the 2 per cent target  it is up to us to raise interest rates. Consequently  excessively high wage increases will not lead  except possibly in the very short run  to higher inflation. Instead they will result in weaker economic activity and lower employment in the years ahead. In the earlier situation with a fixed exchange rate  excessively high wage increases primarily affected manufacturing and other parts of the economy that are exposed to international competition. Today the effects will be felt in particular by sectors that are sensitive to interest rates  such as distributive trades and a debt-burdened public sector. BIS Review 96/1997 4. Conclusions for monetary policy - 5 - The overall assessment in the inflation report is that the monetary stance is well balanced. Today there is no reason to modify that conclusion. In the past month there has been no appreciable change in the outlook for inflation. After the interest rate increases in Germany and other countries almost a week ago  many people have asked how this affects the Riksbank’s actions. As stated already on several occasions  the answer is: not much as long as the conditions for inflation have not changed. The Riksbank targets inflation and it is this target that guides policy. In view of what has happened in the past month  there is reason  finally  to highlight a couple of points in the report. The first is that monetary policy is being conducted against the background of an economic upswing. A gradual increase in capacity utilisation is therefore probable. Sweden does not differ from Germany in that particular respect. The other point is the diminished risk of a development that is appreciably weaker than in the main scenario; this assessment is supported by the latest statistics. In the light of the rising activity  the main difficulty in assessing future inflation currently lies in an uncertainty about developments on the supply side  wage formation in particular. It is difficult to foresee how the Swedish economy will react to a broad economic upswing. It is therefore important  not least on that account  to analyse incoming information. BIS Review 96/1997

Phillips  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at Bentley College  Waltham  Massachusetts on 15/10/97. Black Monday: 10 Years Later Thank you for inviting me to participate in this program sponsored by the Financial Women’s Association. We are drawing very close to the tenth anniversary of the stock market crash. It is useful to reassess that event in the context of subsequent market and regulatory changes. The crash was one of those (fortunately rare) events that serve as a watershed for our discussion of markets and public policies. Considerations of regulatory approaches now almost always use the crash as a reference point. Panels such as this one provide a vehicle for evaluating not only what we have learned from the event but also the various actions taken following the crash. But it is also appropriate to look forward. Changes in financial markets and the risk management capability of firms have been significant in the intervening years. The crash may no longer be as useful a reference point for judging events and evaluating public policy responses. I suppose everyone can remember what they were doing on the day of the crash. I had the good fortune to have left the CFTC prior to the crash. Thus  I got to watch events unfold from the cornfields of Iowa. Later  however  I participated in several post-crash evaluations. Even now  at the Federal Reserve Board  the crash periodically comes up in supervisory discussions about bank risk. (Regrettably  the crash is now part of a pantheon of financial market “problems” that include Barings  Daiwa  Metallgesellschaft  Orange County  and Sumitomo.) The Legacy of the Crash The legacy of the crash is both tangible and intangible. An impressive number of studies of the crash were done. The more noteworthy ones take up about three linear feet on my bookshelf  a very tangible reminder. More seriously  the studies done after the crash were wide-ranging and examined events through the eyes of many different market participants  many different regulators  and a host of academicians. They identified weaknesses in trading and clearing systems that have resulted in tangible changes to those systems. These changes have been very positive. Exchanges have greatly expanded their ability to handle surges in volume  for example. The capitalization of market makers has been bolstered as well. Numerous changes also have been implemented in clearing systems. Doubts that emerged about the soundness of clearing systems were some of the most frightening aspects of the crash. The changes to clearing systems have received far less attention than those to trading systems  but their long-term consequences likely are more profound. Such critical parts of the “plumbing” as the agreements between the futures clearing houses and the settlement banks have been clarified and put on a much sounder footing. In addition  many clearing organizations have established back-up liquidity facilities that will enable them to make payments to clearing members in a timely fashion even if a clearing member has defaulted. In both our evaluation of trading mechanisms and our evaluation of clearing systems  an important intangible outcome of the crash is that we now have a better understanding of the way these systems work. During ordinary trading days  market participants rarely if ever question counterparties’ ability and willingness to perform on obligations. In the months following the crash  policy makers and market participants began to examine those payment conventions more closely. The bulk of the changes to risk management systems that flowed from the crash related to efforts to clarify or make more rigorous the responsibilities and obligations of market participants that previously had been left ambiguous or were part of the lore of “normal” market practice. BIS Review 96/1997 - 2 - Another very important intangible legacy of the crash is our better understanding of the need for cooperation and coordination among commodity  securities  and banking market authorities. The crash vividly illustrated the extent to which markets are intertwined and the extent to which large financial firms have lines of business that cut across many markets. The forums for coordination are almost too numerous to mention  not least of which is the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets. The Working Group comprises the heads of the Treasury  SEC  CFTC  and Federal Reserve  and in addition  other banking supervisory agencies  the National Economic Council  and the Council of Economic Advisers participate. Prospect Looking forward  we are better positioned today to absorb market shocks than we were prior to the 1987 crash. We undoubtedly  however  will have many different problems in future periods of volatility. Responses to events such as the 1987 crash tend to be crisis-specific. One of our challenges is to make public policy responsive to changing market conditions rather than let it be driven solely by the most recent crisis. The circuit breakers put in place after the crash offer an interesting example of this phenomenon. Circuit breakers are trading halts coordinated across the equity and equity derivatives markets. They were first suggested by the Brady Task Force  and they are one of the more notable recommendations of that report. As stated in the report  the purpose of this (and the other recommendations) was “[t]o help prevent a repetition of the events of mid-October and to provide an effective and coordinated response in the face of market disorder.” Circuit breakers are widely cited today as one of the successes of the crash post-mortems. But I  for one  question this evaluation. Circuit breakers have never actually been triggered  in contrast to some of the so-called “speed bumps” which affect particular trading strategies and are now tripped routinely. (In contrast to circuit breakers  which are coordinated across the equity and derivative markets  speed bumps are trading restrictions that have been put in place by individual market places.) If circuit breakers have never been used to halt trading  it follows that we have never had the experience of trying to re-start trading either. To an economist such as myself  some of the scariest times during the market crash were those in which trading was not occurring. Our tendency to worry more about stopping trading than re-starting it is mystifying. (I realize that there has been some discussion about the rules for the resumption of trading but the overwhelming attention has been on the halt.) Recent re-assessments of circuit breakers have focused on increasing the magnitude of price declines necessary to trigger coordinated trading halts. If we are going to continue having circuit breakers  I am supportive of this action and feel that a periodic evaluation of circuit breakers is valuable to ensure that trading halts only occur during very unusual market conditions. Nonetheless  I think that we also should broadly re-evaluate circuit breakers in light of current market conditions. Are circuit breakers fulfilling the goal articulated by the Brady Task Force of providing an effective and coordinated response in the face of market disorder? Do circuit breakers continue to be the best public policy response to market volatility? Many features of financial markets have changed over the last ten years  not least of which is the continuing growth in international activity. Circuit breakers are much more difficult to impose when trading activity can move to markets that do not participate in the trading halt. As I noted earlier  one of my main concerns is the restarting of trading following a halt. If liquidity has moved to over-the-counter markets or foreign venues  how does one get that liquidity back in the domestic  exchange-traded market when the trading halt ends? What kinds of problems might domestic specialists and market makers have in restarting if the market has moved away from them during the halt? Recent changes to shorten the duration of the circuit breakers likely would ameliorate these concerns somewhat  but the worry remains. BIS Review 96/1997 - 3 - Another important change in the financial landscape in the years since the crash has been a greater focus on risk management by both market participants and supervisors. Developments of new instruments  both on and off exchanges  and of new methods for evaluating risk  have given market participants powerful new tools to allow them to absorb market shocks. Similarly  risk management tools have been enhanced at clearing organizations. Regulators must respond to these new tools. To fully utilize their benefits  regulators will need to approach regulation and supervision in different ways. A good example is to be found in the approach by banking supervisors to developing a capital requirement for market risk. After initial fits and starts  the Basle Supervisors’ Committee embraced the concept of using banks’ internal models as a basis for a capital requirement for market risk. The Federal Reserve has taken this process of employing new approaches to regulation a step further with its pre-commitment proposal. Pre-commitment allows banks to commit to the maximum loss they will experience over the next quarter in their trading portfolio; this commitment becomes their capital requirement. The proposal gives banks incentives to establish the commitment in a prudent fashion through fines and disclosures if it is violated. Economists in the audience will recognize this proposal as an application of an incentive-compatible approach to regulation. I suspect that there are far more areas in our regulatory structure in which incentive-compatible approaches could be implemented. Self-regulatory organizations also may find such an approach beneficial  particularly in this era in which SROs are being asked to assume more and more regulatory responsibilities. Incentive-compatible regulation essentially tries to harness the self-interest of market participants to achieve broader public policy goals. By using such an approach  our overall goal is to make individual market participants more resilient and better able to withstand shocks. This  after all  is the most basic (and probably the most effective) protection for firms faced with events such as the 1987 crash. At a macroeconomic level  public policies also should ensure that markets and the economy itself can withstand shocks. While the 1987 crash did not have significant  real economic effects  this is not always the case with stock market crashes. Such episodes are generally accompanied by dramatic increases in uncertainty and increased demands for liquidity and safety. Some of these demands for liquidity may  in turn  reflect the fear that the crisis will spread more broadly to the economy. In 1987  a key role played by the Federal Reserve was to demonstrate a determination to meet liquidity demands  and thereby to reassure market participants that problems would not spread beyond the financial system. Problems were contained in this instance  but policy makers cannot be complacent. In the lessons to be learned from the crash  we should not lose sight of the potential for financial crises to have real effects and of the on-going need for public policies to be directed toward mitigating these effects.

I. The twentieth century does not lack for experience or lessons derived from different international monetary arrangements. Now -- just before this century comes to a close -- Europe is about to embark on a new experiment with far-reaching implications: a monetary union of nation states with a supranational central bank. Some economists see this as things coming full circle. The century began with the gold standard. It will end with a monetary union. As at the beginning of this century  at its end there will be a “denationalised” currency. Countries cannot produce this money more as they see fit. Whereas earlier this century they tied themselves to the availability of gold  in the future European monetary union the guardian of the currency will be a European Central Bank which is independent of national decision-making and which is committed solely to the objective of internal monetary stability. Those economists who stress this historical connection generally take an optimistic view of it. They expect the single currency to bring about an economic and political commitment which is in itself strong enough permanently to compel the participating countries to abide by the rules of the game. Without the option of altering the exchange rate and without the option of an autonomous interest-rate policy  national monetary policy will not be available as an instrument for correcting a current account deficit within the Union. The only possibility will be an adjustment in the real economy. According to this view  monetary union will have a strong disciplining effect. It will exert sufficient pressure on countries to tackle their real problems and to solve them internally  too. To that extent  it will carry on those effects of the gold standard which are regarded as having been successful. This optimistic reference to experience of the gold standard First of all  one might ask how far that view idealises the way in which the gold standard worked. That is something which historians may argue over. At all events  that era was by no means a golden age. Be that as it may -- above all  the conditions for the functioning of the gold standard were different then. Countries’ government ratios were in the order of scarcely more than ten per cent at that time. The adjustments that were necessary given a change in competitive conditions -- which  naturally enough  primarily concern the private sector -- were spread comparatively widely over the major part of the economy. By contrast  the government ratio in many European countries nowadays is around fifty per cent or more. Adjustment in line with market conditions is thus now concentrated -- more or less -- on half of the economy. Prices and wages were also more flexible a hundred years ago; at any rate  more flexible than they are now in the majority of countries on the European continent. And  above all  the government had a different perception of its own role. Its core tasks at that time were to frame and protect the domestic legal system and to pursue national interests abroad. BIS Review 97/1997 - 2 - Nowadays  in the eyes of citizens and the electorate  the nation state and the government have a much deeper and more general economic and social responsibility for growth  incomes and employment. It is  at any rate  very optimistic under present-day conditions to assume that monetary commitment by the monetary union and the supranational central bank would only have to be strong enough and that it would then be able to enforce any desired adjustment needs automatically. What should not be overlooked is that abiding by the rules of the game depends on countries having an adequate capacity to be correspondingly flexible  just as it presupposes the common political will to submit to those rules of monetary stability on a lasting basis. That far-reaching economic and political dimension of monetary union should not be underestimated -- precisely in the world of today and tomorrow. The abolition of the exchange rate is  at all events  an occurrence of far-reaching importance. II. The exchange rate is a price; one of the most important in an economy. Like all prices  its prime task is to manage allocation. Put in simple terms  this means that if the exchange rate is at a level which is appropriate to competitive conditions and if the fundamental determinants -- such as differences in the inflation rate and productivity or the conditions of demand -- remain largely constant  then the exchange rate can and should be as stable as possible  too. It is then that its information content is at its highest. And this also brings about a high degree of certainty in planning for economic arrangements. If  on the other hand  there is a change in the fundamental determinants  the exchange rate should realign as rapidly as possible -- unless an economy is in a position to correct disequilibria quickly and efficiently by virtue of its own adjustment measures. These two requirements which exchange rates are expected to meet appear at first glance to pose a dilemma for monetary policy. On the one hand  the exchange rate should be stable; on the other  it should react as quickly as possible to fundamental imbalances. But  given appropriate policies  this is a pseudo-problem. It is largely solved for a monetary policy which is guided by the internal objective of stability; a steady policy geared to monetary stability helps in both respects. It reduces volatility because it introduces calm into the markets. At the same time  it is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to keeping fundamentally forced exchange rate changes at a low level and to strengthening flexibility and market mechanisms domestically. This pseudo-dilemma is then essentially solved for exchange-rate policy  too. That is because a country cannot in any case freely decide between exchange-rate systems -- say  more fixed or more flexible rates -- in line with its preferences like a visitor to a restaurant between different dishes on the menu. Fixed exchange rates presuppose the ability to cope with that arrangement. It is therefore not a matter of whether one finds less flexible exchange rates  or even their final elimination in a monetary union  “appealing” or “attractive”. The crucial point is: fixed exchange rates must be feasible and  above all  sustainable under prevailing political and economic conditions. III. Post-war global and European monetary history was inseparably linked for a quarter of a century with the Bretton Woods system. In origin  it was a gold exchange standard with fixed but adjustable exchange rates against the US dollar  for which there was an obligation to exchange currency for gold. At its inception there was  above all  the desire to overcome the BIS Review 97/1997 monetary conditions of the 1930s. Competitive devaluations  far-reaching import restrictions and exchange controls seriously hindered world trade and economic cooperation between countries at that time. Against that historical backdrop  many economists rightly celebrated the Bretton Woods system as a great success. Without doubt  it put in place important groundwork for today’s high degree of openness in the goods and financial markets. Admittedly  a comprehensive assessment must not overlook at least three problem areas. Firstly  even the Bretton Woods system displayed the “vulnerability” of almost all systems of fixed exchange rates. Current account imbalances were combated too hesitantly. Corrections of exchange rates were made too late and often brought about new misalignments. Secondly  the years in which the system flourished have to be seen against the backdrop of restricted convertibility. It was not until 1961 that most west European countries introduced full convertibility. And precisely in the United States  too  capital controls were a frequently deployed instrument into the 1960s. Incidentally  even the financial markets which -- from the present perspective -- were still not very developed at that time showed their strength in that situation. There was  on the one hand  the ability to bypass administrative regulations. The Euro-dollar market came into being as early as the late 1950s  for example. On the other  there was the ability to exert speculative pressure on a currency with an exchange rate that appeared no longer to deserve confidence. Thirdly  countries with a better domestic stability record than the anchor country at that time  the United States -- such as Germany in the 1096s and early 1970s -- imported inflation through the fixed rate system. The expression “dollar inflation machine” was in use for a time. A firm anchor and a timely realignment of parities -- those are the basic requirements of any stability-oriented system of fixed exchange rates. The European Monetary System established at the end of the 1970s has performed better than the Bretton Woods system in a number of respects. It has provided a better solution for the question of the nominal anchor -- without officially designating the D-Mark for that role. Rather  it is a role which the D-Mark has acquired on account of its long-standing stability and its early convertibility. The parity-grid system permits the currency which is most stable on a long-term basis to set the standard. The anchor in the ERM is a position which can be recalled  however. Admittedly  even in the ERM there have been times when exchange rates that had become doubtful have not been corrected in time -- as the events of 1992 and 1993  in particular  showed. At all events  it was possible to guide the ERM out of the crisis by a formal widening of the fluctuation margins and largely stabilise it in the ensuing period. IV. Despite a number of earlier reform efforts  the Bretton Woods system eventually collapsed in 1973. Since then  the exchange rates of most European countries and of Japan have floated against the US dollar. By abandoning the fixed rates against the US dollar  monetary policy gained new freedom. From that time onwards  it has  above all  been able to pursue a domestic goal. The initial phase in the era of flexible exchange rates was clearly marked by differences in the domestic stance of monetary policy in a large number of countries. That was apparent particularly in the 1970s when most countries were hit hard -- although to differing BIS Review 97/1997 - 4 - degrees -- by oil price movements. A number of countries -- including Germany -- were principally concerned with restoring domestic monetary stability or with ensuring that it was jeopardised as little as possible in the long term. Others attempted to use a relaxed monetary policy to cushion the adjustment needs of their economies caused by the oil price shocks. In line with that  there came to be wide differences between inflation rates. Those differences had the following results. Firstly  the countries which gave priority to safeguarding monetary stability adapted more quickly to the new conditions and also achieved better results in the medium term with regard to the goal of employment. Secondly  a disparity arose between individual countries in terms of the reputation and credibility of their anti-inflationary stance -- some of the effects of which are still felt today. Thirdly  the plan to realise a European monetary union which was initiated at the end of the 1960s at the Hague Summit foundered before a real political decision had been taken. The initial phase of world-wide flexible exchange rates thus up to now has two crucial messages. Firstly  the best contribution that monetary policy can make to lasting growth and employment is a clear anti-inflationary stance. In the long term  jobs cannot be “bought” by higher inflation. That was already true even in the 1970s when unemployment -- at least in many industrial countries -- was still predominantly cyclical in nature. That is all the more the case today when unemployment largely structural causes. The permanent anti-inflationary stance of the monetary union is therefore an essential condition for Europe’s future success in creating and safeguarding jobs. in Europe has Secondly  it would be disastrous for the monetary union if political differences concerning the role of monetary policy were to emerge as they did in the 1970s. That is because countries cannot pursue different monetary policies in the monetary union. That would lead to political conflicts -- with the European Central Bank  which operates supranationally  and probably also between the political opinions that prevail at the national level. V. That first phase with -- in some cases -- high rates of inflation initially brought the system of flexible exchange rates into disrepute. The 1980s taught new lessons  however -- at least following the change of course in domestic policy starting in France after 1983. Inflation rates gradually receded in many countries. This was a broad process. It took place in the European countries which belonged to the European Monetary System. It also took place in countries without fixed exchange rates  however. Obviously  many countries changed their orientation. External exchange rate pegging  such as to the D-Mark in the European Monetary System  certainly made that easier for some countries. But it also became apparent that what mattered crucially in the final analysis was the political will for monetary stability. This reorientation was undoubtedly in part a reaction to the negative experience of an inflation-accommodating monetary policy in the 1970s and early 1980s. At the same time  it was made easier by the fact that over the years  together with a clear-cut target  a number of central banks had also gained greater independence. For that reason  the system of flexible (or  at least  sufficiently  flexible) exchange rates is now regarded in a certain way as having been rehabilitated. It is precisely on the condition of free movement of capital and financial markets which nowadays largely operate internationally that it can indeed exert pressure for a monetary policy geared to stability. Another hope of the supporters of flexible exchange rates is likely to remain unfulfilled  however: the hope that speculation will always have only a stabilising impact and BIS Review 97/1997 that  following a change in the fundamentals  the exchange rate will glide smoothly and gently to a new equilibrium level. In actual fact  the path taken by exchange rates is often quite bumpy and cannot always be explained convincingly even ex post. Overreactions are not infrequent. Obviously  expectations of future economic and political trends play a major role in the formation of exchange rates. Not only do they contribute to higher volatility because swings in mood often set in abruptly. They can apparently also superimpose themselves on current data so strongly that misalignments may occur  at least for a while. The sharp appreciation of the D-Mark against the US dollar in spring 1995 was a development of that kind. Admittedly  a fair critic has to concede two mitigating arguments to the system of flexible exchange rates. First of all  it is undoubtedly too simplistic to blame the system for every obviously excessive exchange rate movement of currencies whose rates are formed flexibly. There are some  for example  who regard the excessive trend of the US dollar in the 1980s as the nightmare of the present global monetary system. But one has to recognise  of course  what lay behind this. It was during that period that the resolute reversal in the Fed’s monetary policy under Paul Volcker coincided with the expansionary fiscal policy of the Reagan administration. In particular  US fiscal policy stood in marked contrast at that time with German fiscal policy  which was on a course of moderate consolidation. It is quite possible to ask the question: “What other exchange rate arrangement would have actually withstood those tensions?” If anything  fixed exchange rates would probably have increased those tensions or would at least have politicised them more strongly. The Plaza and Louvre cooperation initiatives were probably the most that could be achieved at that time  although it has to be said in passing that the results were by no means only positive ones -- as is shown by the example of the development of asset price inflation in Japan  which was encouraged at that time by an expansionary monetary policy  and its consequences -- from which that country is still suffering. As a second line of defence it can be pointed out that world trade is developing at a furious pace despite flexible exchange rates between the major international currencies. That may be due to the fact that incorrectly valuated exchange rates tend to correct themselves in the medium term. It may also be due to the fact that good possibilities are now available for guarding against sharp exchange rate fluctuations. This can take the form of hedging operations in the financial markets. It can also take the form of a diversification of production centres. To that extent  highly volatile exchange rates can influence not only trade but also direct investment. And that undoubtedly has longer-term effects which should not be underrated. For that reason  exchange rates which are as stable as possible are  of course  important -- but more in terms of real rather than nominal stability. However  the question remains of how the objective of real exchange rate stability can be achieved as comprehensively as possible. There is unlikely to be an answer which is valid for all countries and their relations with each other. VI. In the current debate in Europe the question is also asked repeatedly whether the future euro/dollar exchange rate will be more stable than  say  the present relationship between the D-Mark and the dollar. Ultimately  this is an empirical question  of course. It can really be answered only in the light of the monetary union. There are a number of considerations which point in differing directions. BIS Review 97/1997 - 6 - The euro will probably have a larger and deeper financial market than the D-Mark. That means  first of all  that the price effects will tend to be slighter when assets are switched by the individual investors and that the exchange rate will also be moved less as a result. The larger euro financial market might  however  also lead to investors generally regarding the euro -- more than the D-Mark now -- as a substitute for the US dollar. That might increase the desire to switch funds in certain situations. In that case  the exchange rate would tend to fluctuate more. At times  one also encounters the argument that the euro area -- as a large economic and currency area -- will be relatively less dependent on foreign trade  particularly as the structure of exports is heavily diversified. The outcome would be -- at least  according to the standard textbooks -- that the euro/dollar exchange rate is not as important for Europe. This argument is undoubtedly fundamentally correct and also of significance. The comparison with other major currency areas -- such as the dollar area -- has only limited validity  however. The high share of domestic transactions is not the only reason why the United States can  if anything  neglect the dollar’s exchange rate. It can also do that because its own currency area corresponds to its national boundaries. In the United States  not only is there a comparatively high degree of labour mobility and flexibility in labour costs  there are also compensatory and cooperative mechanisms in the area of public finance at the level of national government. These are able to cushion remaining regional and sectoral tensions which cause major exchange rate fluctuations. The supranational monetary union in Europe has neither comparable mobility and flexibility nor compensatory mechanisms in the area of public finance. This  too  reveals  the particular conditions of monetary union in Europe. In the European monetary union asymmetrical effects will probably tend to lead more quickly to a need for real adjustment in the countries or regions concerned. VII. The present world monetary system is  of course  not just characterised by the major international currencies floating against each other. At the same time  many countries have entered into arrangements to peg exchange rates of varying intensity. There are essentially two motives for this: Firstly -- particularly in the case of smaller economies -- the foreign trade motive. Countries want to strengthen their international economic integration with a fixed exchange rate. Secondly  the stability motive. By pegging the exchange rate  countries want to import credibility for an anti-inflationary stance -- particularly one which is to be newly established. The record of these arrangements is as varied as the forms of pegging themselves. A number of emerging countries and countries in transition have had mixed experiences of pegging their exchange rates to other currencies. However useful it was for them in an initial phase to gain confidence in the international markets by pegging their exchange rate  it has almost always been the case that tensions have arisen and  unfortunately  often erupted after a few years if the trend in domestic competitiveness was not able to keep up with the anchor country on a long-term basis. That has become apparent not only for some countries in Latin America and in eastern Europe but only just recently in South-East Asia  too -- especially if exchange rates have not been adjusted quickly enough to changed competitive conditions. The prospects of a pegging of exchange rates being successful have to be seen in the context of the BIS Review 97/1997 present-day international financial markets. Their impact on the permanence of exchange rate pegging is an ambivalent one. On the one hand  the international financial markets can make arrangements of this kind obsolete more or less overnight if the conviction disappears that the pegging will hold. On the other hand  they encourage strategies of this kind since they offer the countries the option of financing quite sizeable current account deficits. Mainly two problems arise when pegging the exchange rate. Firstly  it may be that a country is currently achieving a comparatively high level of monetary stability but the markets still doubt the country’s determination to persist with that strategy. In that case  real interest rates -- at least in a transitional phase -- are relatively high. Doubts about sustainability threaten to become a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. That was at certain periods the French problem with its franc fort policy. Secondly  it may be that a country achieves a significant fall in inflation by pegging the exchange rate. But a certain -- if only slight -- inflation differential vis-à-vis the reference currency often stubbornly remains nonetheless. That may be due to inflation expectations from the past which are not entirely eliminated. That may also be due in part to a political deficit; a fiscal policy that fails to give adequate support to the pegging of the exchange rate or an overgenerous domestic monetary policy in the light of capital inflows. Be that as it may  the outcome is that the currency gradually appreciates in real terms. The current account shows a chronic deficit. In a situation of that kind  a country must consider a strategy to find its way out. The fixed parity is not sustainable on a lasting basis  even if the financial markets go along with it for a time. This implies an important message for the envisaged monetary union in Europe since monetary union does not offer the possibility of a way out. The requisite ability to achieve lasting domestic and external stability must be established and proven before entry in all the member states. That is what the entry criteria aim for. It would be a risk to hope that a country’s necessary ability to achieve stability will gradually come about after entry into monetary union. Even if this were achieved over time  price competitiveness might already have been seriously impaired by then. And the catching-up process would be even more ambitious. There will  in fact  be certain regional differences in inflation rates within the monetary union. That is a normal process  to the extent that it will reflect differing trends in productivity or shifts in patterns of demand. Enormous economic tensions would occur  however  if it were also a reflection of varying ability to achieve stability and hence to accept the supranational monetary policy. Sufficient anti-inflationary convergence must therefore precede entry into monetary union  not the other way round. At all events  the reverse order would not be without considerable risks. VIII. It is desirable and beneficial to have as high a degree of exchange rate stability as possible against the currencies of other EU and non-EU countries  too. Stable exchange rates need convergence -- either in the sense that fundamental deviations do not occur or in the sense that existing imbalances are rapidly eliminated owing to a high level of flexibility in domestic prices and in the structure of the economy. In principle  that is a valid statement irrespective of the exchange rate system  in fact. It just happens to be the case that in the reverse situation -- if there is a lack of convergence -- the exchange rate system plays a major role. If exchange rates are flexible  divergence in anti-inflationary policy can increase volatility but it is less dramatic overall. In turn  the degree of convergence is also lower  of course. The degree of convergence tends to be BIS Review 97/1997 - 8 - higher with fixed but adjustable exchange rates. If there is  nevertheless  no adequate convergence  costs will depend on whether there is a timely realignment. If prompt action is taken  the consequences will be contained. By contrast  if the realignments take place only under pressure from the markets  high costs can easily arise -- not just for the country itself  by the way. A “case” like this can easily negate the credibility of a whole system or make the unilateral pegging of other countries -- even those in other continents -- more difficult. For that reason the fact that the alignment of the exchange rates in ERM II is to be made easier than in the present system is a positive development. It is to be hoped that this will prove its value in practice  too  in future. The choice of the exchange rate system must  at any rate  be consistent with the economic and political conditions which obtain in the participating countries. A mixed world monetary system -- with floating key currencies  on the one hand  and regional integration through monetary union and fixed exchange rates  on the other -- might not be the best of all hypothetical worlds. But that system is probably the one that corresponds most closely to conditions in the real world. It is not inherently a badly designed structure or a non-system. There can indeed be appropriate graduations of flexibility that are in line with the realities. IX. Understandably  the question is now frequently being asked: “What place will the euro take in the future world monetary system?” The answer which is often given is the notion of a future tripolar system consisting of the dollar  the yen and the euro. That vision is  at least  not very accurate. If one wants to speak of a tripolar system at all  the weights in it will differ quite considerably. Even now  it is becoming apparent that the yen’s potential relative to the other two currencies will  if anything  remain limited. At all events  in the foreseeable future it will probably lack the regional base in Asia itself which the euro is likely to have in Europe. But the euro will first have to earn its position. That is because an international currency essentially needs three properties: a high level of lasting stability a strong base in the real economy and efficient financial markets. The euro has the potential to fulfil those three conditions. But that will not occur automatically. For that to happen  the preconditions have to be right. Replacing the dollar as the leading currency is  however  probably not on the agenda. Monetary history has shown that a key currency being superseded is ultimately due to an internal crisis in the country in question. The former leading country loses the confidence of the markets. The capacity for domestic stability diminishes. The economy becomes less competitive. That was also the history of the decline of the pound sterling as a global key currency following the Second World War. There are no indications whatsoever of a comparable development in the case of the US dollar. On the contrary  the dollar is a strong currency and -- despite a current account deficit and growing external debt -- the US fundamentals do not point to a change in that situation. BIS Review 97/1997 X. The euro and the dollar can enter into fruitful competition  however. The world monetary system as a whole will be able to benefit from healthy competition between two currencies which are geared to stability. There are three particular factors which would promote productive competition of this kind: Firstly  that the current high degree of correspondence in the anti-inflationary stance of the United States and Europe continues; secondly that fiscal policy in both the Unites States and Europe remains on a similar course of consolidation and -- particularly in Europe -- achieves further progress; and thirdly  that both the United States and Europe fulfil the expectations of meeting the economic challenges which they face. The United States must demonstrate that its high debtor position and hence its future financial obligations are covered by the dynamism  efficiency and innovative potential of its economy. The Europeans must show that they are making structural changes to tackle the problem of unemployment and that they are improving their competitiveness in global markets. Productive competition of this kind does not imply a rejection of greater world-wide cooperation in economic and monetary policies with the aim of contributing to higher exchange rate stability. On the contrary  it is precisely in the future  too  that cooperation of this kind will be meaningful and desirable. In saying this  what should not be overlooked is that exchange rates are not the actual operational parameters. Rather  they are the result of economic developments and economic policy in the participating countries. For that reason  there is one lesson which should conclude this lecture. It is perhaps as old as monetary history itself. A suitable monetary framework can help a country to carry out the structural reforms which are needed. Being a substitute for the adjustments which an economy has to make to changed conditions  however  is something which monetary policy -- however good it is -- cannot do. BIS Review 97/1997

We meet against the background of considerable turbulence in world financial markets  and I shall address the bulk of my remarks to those circumstances. We need to assess these developments against the backdrop of a continuing impressive performance of the American economy in recent months. Growth appears to have remained robust and inflation low  and even falling  despite an ever tightening labor market. Our economy has enjoyed a lengthy period of good economic growth  linked  not coincidentally  to damped inflation. The Federal Reserve is dedicated to contributing as best it can to prolonging this performance  and we will be watching economic and financial market developments closely and evaluating their implications. Even after the sharp rebound around the world in the past twenty-four hours  declines in stock markets in the United States and elsewhere have left investors less wealthy than they were a week ago and businesses facing higher equity cost of capital. Yet  provided the decline in financial markets does not cumulate  it is quite conceivable that a few years hence we will look back at this episode  as we now look back at the 1987 crash  as a salutary event in terms of its implications for the macroeconomy. The 1987 crash occurred at a time when the American economy was operating with a significant degree of inflationary excess that the fall in market values arguably neutralized. Today’s economy  as I have been suggesting of late  has been drawing down unused labor resources at an unsustainable pace  spurred  in part  by a substantial wealth effect on demand. The market’s net retrenchment of recent days will tend to damp that impetus  a development that should help to prolong our six-and-a-half-year business expansion. As I have testified previously  much of the stock price gain since early 1995 seems to have reflected upward revisions of long-term earnings expectations  which were implying a continuing indefinite rise in profit margins from already high levels. I suspect we are experiencing some scaling back of the projected gains in foreign affiliate earnings  and investors probably also are revisiting expectations of domestic earnings growth. Still  the foundation for good business performance remains solid. Indeed  data on our national economy in recent months are beginning to support the notion that productivity growth  the basis for increases in earnings  is beginning to pick up. I also suspect earnings expectations and equity prices in the United States were primed to adjust. The currency crises in Southeast Asia and the declines in equity prices there and elsewhere do have some direct effects on U.S. corporate earnings  but not enough to explain the recent behavior of our financial markets. If it was not developments in Southeast Asia  something else would have been the proximate cause for a re-evaluation. While productivity growth does appear to have picked up in the last six months  as I have pointed out in the past  it likely is overly optimistic to assume that the dimension of any acceleration in productivity will be great enough and persistent enough to close  by itself  the gap between an excess of long-term demand for labor and its supply. It will take some time to judge the extent of a lasting improvement. Regrettably  over the last year the argument for the so-called new paradigm has slowly shifted from the not unreasonable notion that productivity is in the process of accelerating  to a less than credible view  often implied rather than stated  that we need no longer be concerned about the risk that inflation can rise again. The Federal Reserve cannot afford to take such a complacent view of our price prospects. There is much that is encouraging in the recent performance of the American economy  but  as I have often mentioned before  fundamental change comes slowly and we need to evaluate the prospective balance of supply and demand for various productive resources in deciding policy. BIS Review 98/1997 - 2 - Recent developments in equity markets have highlighted growing interactions among national financial markets. The underlying technology-based structure of the international financial system has enabled us to improve materially the efficiency of the flows of capital and payment systems. That improvement  however  has also enhanced the ability of the financial system to transmit problems in one part of the globe to another quite rapidly. The recent turmoil is a case in point. I believe there is much to be learned from the recent experience in Asia that can be applied to better the workings of the international financial system and its support of international trade that has done so much to enhance living standards worldwide. While each of the Asian economies differs in many important respects  the sources of their spectacular growth in recent years  in some cases decades  and the problems that have recently emerged are relevant to a greater or lesser extent to nearly all of them. Following the early post-World War II period  policies generally fostering low levels of inflation and openness of their economies coupled with high savings and investment rates contributed to a sustained period of rapid growth  in some cases starting in 1960s and 1970s. By the 1980s most economies in the region were expanding vigorously. Foreign net capital inflows grew  but until recent years were relatively modest. The World Bank estimates that net inflows of long-term debt  foreign direct investment  and equity purchases to the Asia Pacific region were only about $25 billion in 1990  but exploded to more than $110 billion by 1996. A major impetus behind this rapid expansion was the global stock market boom of the 1990s. As that boom progressed  investors in many industrial countries found themselves more heavily concentrated in the recently higher valued securities of companies in the developed world  whose rates of return  in many instances  had fallen to levels perceived as uncompetitive with the earnings potential in emerging economies  especially in Asia. The resultant diversification induced a sharp increase in capital flows into those economies. To a large extent  they came from investors in the United States and Western Europe. A substantial amount came from Japan  as well  owing more to a search for higher yields than to rising stock prices and capital gains in that country. The rising yen through mid-1995 also encouraged a substantial increase in direct investment inflows from Japan. In retrospect  it is clear that more investment monies flowed into these economies than could be profitably employed at modest risk. I suspect that it was inevitable in those conditions of low inflation  rapid growth and ample liquidity that much investment moved into the real estate sector  with an emphasis by both the public and private sectors on conspicuous construction projects. This is an experience  of course  not unknown in the United States on occasion. These real estate assets  in turn  ended up as collateral for a significant proportion of the assets of domestic financial systems. In many instances  those financial systems were less than robust  beset with problems of lax lending standards  weak supervisory regimes  and inadequate capital. Moreover  in most cases  the currencies of these economies were closely tied to the U.S. dollar  and the dollar’s substantial recovery since mid-1995  especially relative to the yen  made their exports less competitive. In addition  in some cases  the glut of semiconductors in 1996 suppressed export growth  exerting further pressures on highly leveraged businesses. However  overall GDP growth rates generally edged off only slightly  and imports  fostered by rising real exchange rates  continued to expand  contributing to what became unsustainable current account deficits in a number of these economies. Moreover  with exchange rates seeming to be solidly tied to the dollar  and with dollar and yen interest rates lower than domestic currency rates  a significant part of the enlarged capital inflows  into these economies  in particular short-term flows  was denominated by the ultimate borrowers in foreign currencies. This put additional pressure on companies to earn foreign exchange through exports. BIS Review 98/1997 - 3 - The pressures on fixed exchange rate regimes mounted as foreign investors slowed the pace of new capital inflows  and domestic businesses sought increasingly to convert domestic currencies into foreign currencies  or  equivalently  slowed the conversion of export earnings into domestic currencies. The shifts in perceived future investment risks led to sharp declines in stock markets across Asia  often on top of earlier declines or lackluster performances. To date  the direct impact of these developments on the American economy has been modest  but it can be expected not to be negligible. U.S. exports to Thailand  the Philippines  Indonesia  and Malaysia (the four countries initially affected) were about four percent of total U.S. exports in 1996. However  an additional 12 percent went to Hong Kong  Korea  Singapore and Taiwan (economies that have been affected more recently). Thus  depending on the extent of the inevitable slowdown in growth in this area of the world  the growth of our exports will tend to be muted. Our direct foreign investment in  and foreign affiliate earnings reported from  the economies in this region as a whole have been a smaller share of the respective totals than their share of our exports. The share is  nonetheless  large enough to expect some drop-off in those earnings in the period ahead. In addition  there may be indirect effects on the U.S. real economy from countries such as Japan that compete even more extensively with the economies in the Asian region. Particularly troublesome over the past several months has been the so-called contagion effect of weakness in one economy spreading to others as investors perceive  rightly or wrongly  similar vulnerabilities. Even economies  such as Hong Kong  with formidable stocks of international reserves  balanced external accounts and relatively robust financial systems  have experienced severe pressures in recent days. One can debate whether the recent turbulence in Latin American asset values reflect contagion effects from Asia  the influence of developments in U.S. financial markets  or home-grown causes. Whatever the answer  and the answer may be all of the above  this phenomenon illustrates the interdependencies in today’s world economy and financial system. Perhaps it was inevitable that the impressive and rapid growth experienced by the economies in the Asian region would run into a temporary slowdown or pause. But there is no reason that above-average growth in countries that are still in a position to gain from catching up with the prevailing technology cannot persist for a very long time. Nevertheless  rapidly developing  free-market economies periodically can be expected to run into difficulties because investment mistakes are inevitable in any dynamic economy. Private capital flows may temporarily turn adverse. In these circumstances  companies should be allowed to default  private investors should take their losses  and government policies should be directed toward laying the macroeconomic and structural foundations for renewed expansion; new growth opportunities must be allowed to emerge. Similarly  in providing any international financial assistance  we need to be mindful of the desirability of minimizing the impression that international authorities stand ready to guarantee the liabilities of failed domestic businesses. To do otherwise could lead to distorted investments and could ultimately unbalance the world financial system. The recent experience in Asia underscores the importance of financially sound domestic banking and other associated financial institutions. While the current turmoil has significant interaction with the international financial system  the recent crises would arguably have been better contained if long-maturity property loans had not accentuated the usual mismatch between maturities of assets and liabilities of domestic financial systems that were far from robust to begin with. Our unlamented savings and loan crises come to mind. These are trying days for economic policymakers in Asia. They must fend off domestic pressures that seek disengagement from the world trading and financial system. The authorities in these countries are working hard  in some cases with substantial assistance from the IMF  and the World Bank  and the Asian Development Bank  to stabilize their financial systems and economies. The financial disturbances that have afflicted a number of currencies in Asia do not at this point  as I indicated earlier  threaten prosperity in this country  but we need to work closely with their leaders and the international financial community to assure that their situations stabilize. It is in the BIS Review 98/1997 - 4 - interest of the United States and other nations around the world to encourage appropriate policy adjustments  and where required  provide temporary financial assistance.

r971105c,1997-11-05,https://www.bis.org/review/r971105c.pdf,Bank of Japan presents its quarterly economic outlook for autumn 1997,BANK OF JAPAN  QUARTERLY BULLETIN  November 1997 (advance issue).,Bank of Japan presents its quarterly economic outlook for autumn 1997 BANK OF JAPAN  QUARTERLY BULLETIN  November 1997 (advance issue). Summary Japan’s economic growth has been decelerating since April  partly reflecting the impact of the consumption tax hike. Corporate sentiment has also weakened somewhat. However  the 1. supported by the rise in exports and business fixed investment. Among final demand items  public-sector investment has been declining  and housing investment has also dropped significantly  mainly reflecting the decline after the surge in demand prior to the consumption tax hike. Personal consumption has continued to be sluggish on the whole  although the impact of the consumption tax hike has gradually subsided. However  net exports and business fixed investment have been increasing. In these circumstances  excessive inventories are seen in some industries such as in consumer durables  and industrial production has stayed virtually unchanged. Employment and income conditions have continued to improve  although the pace of recovery has moderated somewhat. Prices remained stable on the whole  excluding the effect of the consumption tax hike. Domestic wholesale prices (adjusted for seasonal electricity rates) have been relatively weak  reflecting easy supply and demand conditions for construction-related goods. The year-to-year decline in corporate service prices has slowed steadily  and the year-to-year growth in consumer prices (nationwide  excluding perishables) has been stable at around 0.5-0.6 per cent. Meanwhile  changes in land prices varied by type  and have not stopped declining on the whole. 2. In the financial markets  the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) stayed at the level slightly below the official discount rate of 0.5 per cent. The long-term government bond yield temporarily rose to near 2.7 per cent at the end of May  but it followed a declining trend since then  reflecting the uncertainty about future economic growth. It has been moving at around the record low level of around 1.7 per cent since early October. Stock prices also moved at a low level of around 17 000 - 18 000. Meanwhile  the yen depreciated somewhat against the U.S. dollar as the contrast between Japan's and U.S. economic growth gained more attention. The yen has recently moved at around 120 - 122 to the U.S. dollar. Growth in bank lending continues to be lackluster. Fund-raising activities through capital markets fell below the previous year's level. Growth in monetary aggregates in terms of M2 + CDs year-to-year average outstanding has continued at around 3 per cent. 3. With respect to the outlook  public-sector investment is expected to continue declining  judging from the government's budget. On the other hand  net exports are expected to follow an increasing trend  reflecting firm overseas demand and the depreciation of the yen to date  although the pace of increase will be slower than that recorded up to the second quarter. According to the Bank of Japan’s Tankan -- Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises of September 1997  the increase in corporate profits overall is expected to be maintained  albeit at a slower pace. While profits of small non-manufacturing firms are expected to decline owing to the decline in demand in addition to structural factors  those of large manufacturing firms are projected to continue on an increasing trend  largely supported by exports. In these circumstances  the pace of increase in business fixed investment may slow down somewhat as investment in telecommunications is expected to remain unchanged after surging in the previous fiscal year. However  given that stock accumulation is not excessive and demand for information-related investment is strong  business fixed investment will continue a steady increase. BIS Review 99/1997 - 2 - As for the household sector  the growth in bonus payments and overtime payments has been slowing. This may suggest that the economic deceleration since spring 1997 has started to affect household income. However  the significant deterioration of household confidence is unlikely to be triggered by these developments  as the current employment conditions are very different from those of around 1993 when the risk of severe employment adjustment was large. Also  the recent weaknesses in personal consumption and housing investment partly reflect the temporary factors  such as the reaction to the front-loading of demand before the consumption tax hike. The downward pressure from fiscal policies is likely to weaken gradually in the near future. Therefore  once the impact of the consumption tax hike subsides  an early recovery of household expenditure may translate into the positive cycle of production  income and expenditure. Still  there are uncertainties about the recovery in personal consumption  as consumer confidence is susceptible to psychological elements. 4. With respect to price developments  domestic wholesale prices are likely to continue to be weak for the time being. This is because inventory adjustment pressures are being exerted  and the downward pressure from electrical goods prices caused by technological innovation remains strong  although the downward pressure coming from import prices has been subsiding. Meanwhile  corporate service prices will stay virtually unchanged  and consumer prices are likely to continue a similar moderate rise. 5. In sum  fiscal policies  including the consumption tax hike  continue to affect Japan’s economy  and the slowdown in domestic demand seems to have influenced corporate profits  employment and income conditions gradually through a deceleration in production activity. However  corporate profits and employees’ income have maintained their growth  although at a somewhat slower pace. Also  labor adjustment and capital stock adjustment pressures are not so large  and the risk of deflation is negligible. In light of this  the basis for economic recovery has not been undermined. If household expenditure picks up and inventory adjustment pressures subside steadily  the economic recovery is likely to gather momentum again  albeit gradually. Given the cautious corporate sentiments and the uncertainty about future developments in demand  it is essential to monitor closely future economic developments  particularly the pace of recovery in household expenditure  and the progress in inventory adjustment.

Reddy  at the Invest India Conferences in Mumbai  on 9/10/97.,Mr. Reddy considers the future of India's debt market 1997 Inaugural address given by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India  Dr. Y.V. Reddy  at the Invest India Conferences in Mumbai  on 9/10/97. The Future of India’s Debt Market 1997 I am happy to be amongst you this morning. This conference gives me an opportunity to sharpen my thoughts  and gain insights from the deliberations. The subject has gained importance over the years  and in particular  more recently after the Monetary and Credit Policy of April 1997. In fact  there is a sudden spurt in conferences on this subject  as for example  the SBICAP Debt Market Seminar held last month. Also  there was pretty elaborate coverage of this subject during the last two days in the discussions of Bank Economists’ Conference on the Second Phase of Reforms in the Financial Sector. The objective of this national conference  as I understand  is to assess recent changes and examine issues which merit urgent consideration in order to achieve an efficient and vibrant debt market. In the seminar organised by the SBICAP  Governor  Dr. C. Rangarajan had flagged some specific issues which would help in formulating an agenda for further reforms in the debt markets. I would urge this audience to give serious consideration to these issues. 2. India and the Government of India in the debt market in the recent period. These include: Let me  therefore  begin by highlighting the reforms initiated by the Reserve Bank of setting up of a comprehensive system of primary dealers  adoption of DVP system for settlement of government securities transactions  abolition of tax deduction at source on government securities  hedge their foreign currency risk in the forward market  introduction of Treasury bills of varying maturities  and placing investments of banks in preference shares/debentures/bonds of corporates outside the five per cent limit. In a bid to increase transparency in operations  the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been disseminating information on its transactions in gilts and publishing the calendar of auctions in respect of Treasury bills and repos. Soon  the RBI proposes to publish data on banks’ investments in corporate and PSU debt in the Weekly Statistical Supplement to the RBI Bulletin. To foster inter-institutional coordination  a Technical Advisory Committee for government securities and a Standing Committee on Money Market have been set up. Major issues confronting the debt and money markets are discussed in these committees. These committees have been found to be useful to all participants. 3. As I observe  the discussions in this conference are structured around five sessions  viz.  primary market  secondary market  legal issues  risk management and future directions. For the sake of convenience  I will follow broadly the same structure and pose issues for further deliberations. Primary Market Lack of market clearing yields at primary auctions of government debt is often being 4. cited as a significant factor slowing the development of the secondary market. The arguments run as follows: First  it hampers efforts to broaden the investor base. BIS Review 99/1997 - 2 - Second  at times when cut-off yields in the primary market are lower than prevailing secondary market yields  it curbs secondary trading. Third  to the extent the cut-off yields are lower than secondary market yields  it constrains inventory build-up by primary dealers. Finally  to the extent volumes of pick-up in primary auctions are reduced due to interest rate considerations  it reduces the availability of floating stock in the secondary market. 5. What are the factors that inhibit market clearing mechanisms? There are four important issues  viz.  notifying auction size  type of auction  element of non-competitive bids and frequency of auctions of Treasury bills. Another issue of concern relates to large private placements of corporate debt. 6. At present  there is no pre-announced notified amount in 364-day and 14-day auctions. This procedure enables the RBI to determine either the cut-off price or the amounts to be accepted in a flexible manner. Notifying amounts in auctions will bring more transparency in the auction procedure by removing the uncertainty about volumes in auctions. In this context  it needs to be emphasised that the capacity of primary dealers to absorb auction supply as an underwriter is limited. Currently  primary dealers underwrite to the extent of 50 per cent of the amounts in auctions with notified amounts. In this scenario  there is a danger of devolvement on the RBI  if there is a pre-announced notified amount. The extent of the devolvement on the RBI can be minimised by increasing the underwriting amounts to primary dealers. The RBI could also change the notified amounts between each auction  depending on prevailing market conditions  in order to minimise the devolvement risk on itself. 7. Presently  there are six primary dealers. The institution of primary dealers has partly contributed to a significant increase in secondary market transactions in government securities. Authorising primary dealers is an on-going process. All eligible applicants will be considered by the RBI for primary dealership. While on this subject  an issue that needs to be considered relates to the when-issued market. At present  the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act  1956 prohibits short-selling of securities. Two options could be considered. First  whether to give exclusive access of primary auctions to primary dealers and simultaneously permit them to engage in short sales of government securities. Second  whether to continue with the existing system of access to primary auctions and allow all participants to engage in short sales of government securities. The timing and sequencing of this reform -- whether to introduce it now or wait until the number of primary dealers has enlarged -- are aspects that need to be carefully considered. I would urge upon the participants to discuss the pros and cons of these options and the international practices in this regard. 8. There is some debate over the type of auction that is most suitable for selling Treasury bills and dated government securities in India. There are advocates for both the discriminatory and uniform price auctions. But  international practices seem to be in favour of discriminatory price auctions. In a switch-over from one auction system to another  a number of considerations arise such as easy entry  cost to issuer  return to investor  role of primary dealers  incentive to gather information  etc. This is another area fit for a careful assessment. 9. As you are aware  non-competitive bids are allowed in 91- and 14-day Treasury bills auctions. A major issue relates to the treatment of non-competitive bids. Country practices show that non-competitive bidders are made allocations within the notified amount. However  the non-competitive bidders in other countries consist essentially of small  retail and inexperienced investors. Since the maximum bid is restricted to a small value  the competitive bid prices do not get distorted. There is a view in the Indian market that non-competitive bidders should also be allowed as competitive bidders. However  in our country  since State Governments are major non-competitive bidders  their volatile surplus funds position could make their participation in Treasury bills auctions very uncertain. Thus  there could be large swings in terms of volumes in auctions. Another view is to make allocation for non-competitive bidders outside the notified amount. BIS Review 99/1997 - 3 - There is a view in the market that the high frequency of auctions recently brought about 10. by introducing 14-day Treasury bills auctions (along with frequent repos) tends to hinder secondary market activities by reducing investor participation in the secondary market in favour of waiting for a few days for primary issues. Also  the staggered settlement dates for Treasury bills falling on different days in the week make secondary market trading across different maturities of Treasury bills less efficient. Perhaps  it would be useful for this conference to discuss the need  if any  to reduce auction frequency and adjust settlement dates of different maturity Treasury bills to fall on the same day in the week so as to improve fungibility and thereby price discovery and market efficiency. 11. Finally  an increasingly important concern relates to the issuance of PSU bonds and corporate debentures through private placements. Although  the private placement market plays a crucial role in enabling corporates to raise resources  certain vital issues need to be considered for a well-directed and efficient functioning of the market. At present  there is no transparency in this market and virtually little information. In developed markets  the regulatory authorities indicate the framework within which the private placement has to function  like number of persons per placement  arrangements with only qualified investors and strict regulations to access certain qualified investors. We have to assess the adequacy of the regulatory framework to protect the interest of investors from risks associated with subscriptions in the private placement market. With a proper regulatory framework and more transparency  the private placement market can develop further as an integral and important constituent of the primary market for the raising of resources by corporates; hence  the need to deliberate on the status of regulatory framework. Secondary Market 12. As part of the reform process  a number of technical impediments that prevented more active secondary market trading in government securities and Treasury bills have been progressively removed. Let me briefly recall these: abolition of the system of TDS  issuance of benchmark securities  and operationalising the DVP system at all centres. The RBI is encouraging banks to open SGL II accounts for constituents  thereby enlarging the coverage of book-entry holding of government securities. Recently  the National Stock Exchange has been authorised to open a SGL II account and a current account with the RBI. A decision has been taken to extend a similar facility to the Stock Holding Corporation of India. These steps would further streamline transfer and settlement procedures in the government securities market. 13. In respect of PSU bonds and corporate debentures  which are held mostly in scrip form  a proper settlement system is yet to be put in place. The National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) was expected to dematerialise a sizeable stock of non-government debt. But  at present  NSDL has been able to dematerialise only those securities which are exempt from stamp duty. Suitable amendments to the stamp duty regime appear  therefore  necessary to avoid transaction costs and enable active use of the facility. An appropriate solution is needed  since an efficient transfer and settlement system in the PSU bonds and corporate debt segments could usher in the resumption of repos in these instruments. Once it is assured that risk-free and transparent payment and settlement systems are put in place through a depository like NSDL in dematerialised form  it should be possible to permit such repos. 14. Another issue that has been raised frequently relates to giving permission to financial institutions to borrow through repos in eligible securities. While there is a risk of generating asset-liability mismatches among non-bank participants  the conference could discuss the operational feasibility of allowing such participants into the repo market under suitable safeguards. 15. The Reserve Bank of India is considering a range of options to increase the interest of individual investors in government securities. There is an inherent potential for households to diversify BIS Review 99/1997 - 4 - their investment portfolio encompassing government securities. It would be useful to quickly review marketing and distribution strategies adopted in other countries for reaching government securities to households. Australia  Ireland  the Netherlands and Sweden adopt direct sales of government securities to the retail sector through special registration facilities. Hungary  Switzerland  the UK and the USA retail through non-competitive bidding arrangements. France and Norway use the primary dealers network. Germany  Spain and Turkey have retailing arrangements through the banking system  while Denmark  Ireland  and Poland retail government securities through the stock exchanges. Italy uses both the banking and stock exchange network. The conference could do well to consider strategic options for this important phase of market development. Legal Issues 16. The most important segment of the debt market being government securities  let me start with the relevant law on this. The law relating to government securities and their management by the Reserve Bank of India is the Public Debt Act  1944. The present act dates to pre-independence days  when marketable debt comprised almost the entire borrowing by the Government. This is no longer valid  with almost over Rs.300 000 crore worth of other liabilities of the Government comprising  inter alia  instruments like NSS  Indira Vikas Patra  etc.  falling outside the purview of this Act. Further  provisions of the Public Debt Act relate to issue  servicing and repayment of government securities and do not provide regulation of trading/marketing of government securities. For instance  under the present Act  the Reserve Bank has no substantive powers to design and introduce an instrument of transfer suited to the computer environment. There are other constraints  such as those which preclude the RBI from issuing government securities in the form of promissory notes in the name of trusts  non-availability of nomination facility in respect of government securities  barring a minor from holding government securities  etc. A new Act on government securities is proposed to take care of these issues. Any suggestions on this reform are welcome. It seems appropriate to consider extending the use of depositories established under the 17. Depositories Act to government securities. The Depositories Act came into force in 1996 providing for a legal framework for holding of equities  bonds  debentures  units and other market instruments in dematerialised form in a depository. Such deposits come under the regulatory framework of SEBI. Since the RBI manages the public debt of central and state governments  Public Debt Offices (PDOs) of the RBI are in effect depositories under the Public Debt Act. Thus  giving permission to depositories to hold government securities in dematerialised form would make the provisions of the Depositories Act applicable to the Reserve Bank as an issuer  bringing into focus the respective regulatory roles of the Reserve Bank and SEBI in government securities. One of the suggestions to resolve this is by way of incorporating a provision in the proposed Government Securities Act  excluding the provisions of Depositories Act being applicable to government securities. 18. It would certainly be useful to survey the international experience in this regard. In Canada  Germany and Switzerland  there is central government prudential regulation of depository institutions and provincial or state supervision of securities trading. The Bank of England used to provide regulation of depository institutions  although after the passage of the Bank of England Bill  responsibility for banking supervision will be transferred to the new and strengthened Securities and Investments Board (SIB). The SIB will also take direct responsibility for the regulatory regime covered by the Financial Services Act. In Australia and New Zealand  the central banks provide prudential regulation of depository institutions  but there is no specific regulation of the government securities market. The Japanese Ministry of Finance and the Danish Supervisory Authority for Financial Affairs provide centralised regulation of government securities. As you will have observed  international experience is varied. 19. Another legal issue which is often alluded to relates to forward contracts. This forum would do well to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the repeal of the government notification issued in l969 prohibiting forward contracts in securities. BIS Review 99/1997 Risk Management - 5 - 20. Investors in debt instruments face three major components of risk  viz.  credit risk  interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. In case of government bonds  credit risk is zero. The foreign currency risk is relevant only to non-resident investors like FIIs who are investing in debt instruments. Recently  the 100 per cent debt funds dedicated to the debt market were allowed to take forward cover to enable them to hedge their exchange rate risk. Investments in all debt instruments are exposed to interest rate risk. This risk can be better hedged if a futures market in interest rate exists  or if short-selling in securities is allowed. However  the futures market will be meaningful only in an environment of totally deregulated interest rates and the existence of a term money market which itself is dependent on a credible yield curve. Thus  while the eventual introduction of interest rate futures and permission for short-selling is inevitable  the real issue is one of the timing of these reforms  so that it does not entail any systemic risks. Future Direction 21. Consistent with the spirit of financial sector reforms  the RBI is in the process of the divestment of part of its shareholding of DFHI and STCI  so that the RBI does not have the majority of shareholding. As you are aware  the RBI has taken the initiative to promote STCI and DFHI. The RBI is now a minority shareholder in DFHI and  after the second round of disinvestment in l995  its share is only l0.5 per cent. It has also been decided to disinvest shares of STCI so that after the first phase of disinvestment  the RBI’s shareholding will be less than fifty per cent. Second  non-banking financial companies are now required to maintain a higher level of 22. liquid assets in the form of government securities and government-guaranteed bonds. This will increase the demand for government paper in the market. This will be in addition to the demand generated due to the opening up of provident funds to debt market instruments  emergence of MMMFs and investments by l00 per cent FII debt funds. 23. Third  I would like to flag the vital issue of the role of market participants. Standard practices have to be evolved by the market with regard to the manner of quotes  the conclusion of deals  the manner of pricing and accounting standards. A code of best practices also has to be evolved for repo transactions in eligible securities. In the context of moving towards a liberalised and market-oriented environment in the financial sector  it would be desirable if such standard practices were evolved and accepted in a common forum of a self-regulatory body. At present  I understand that there are moves to create such self-regulatory body/bodies among the PDs and among banks and financial institutions covering transactions in money and fixed-income securities markets. This is a welcome trend and the RBI would be willing to nurture such developments in the market. 24. Finally  the time has come to accord priority for establishing electronic links between the Deposit Accounts Department and Public Accounts Department/Public Debt Office of the RBI for achieving synchronisation of funds and securities transfers. We should also begin planning electronic links between banks  primary dealers and others who have access to the system  so as to pave the way for a more information-efficient and transparent securities market. These plans can succeed only with the concerted efforts of all -- the Government  the Reserve Bank of India and the market participants. I would appreciate your detailed suggestions.

Strengths of the German capital market of today Finanzplatz Deutschland -- the financial centre Germany  which is the “home port” of the D-Mark -- is characterised by the long-standing stability culture of the Deutsche Bundesbank. And the financial centre Germany has benefited considerably from the currency’s stability. With the introduction of the euro everything will change. The financial centre Germany will lose its D-Mark bonus. However  it will gain the opportunity to display its competitiveness with the euro in a larger market. The banks  the German parliament and the Bundesbank have been working for years to increase the attractiveness of Germany as a financial centre. With a view to the introduction of the euro  it is important to further strengthen the competitiveness reached so far through additional innovations. It is essential to prepare for competition in the large European market. But we can say with some satisfaction that even today the financial centre Germany  which is the biggest and most dynamic financial market in continental Europe  is in a good position. Germany is currently the third-largest industrial nation in the world and  since German reunification  it has had the highest population of any country in the European Union; in the wake of reunification  however  it has also changed from a capital-exporting country into a capital-importing one. The large current account surpluses which had prevailed until 1990 have turned into sizeable deficits. But the era of Germany’s current account deficits could soon be a thing of the past. After a seasonally adjusted positive balance was recorded in the second quarter of this year  I expect the German current account will show an annual surplus again in 1998 at the latest. BIS Review 99/1997 - 2 - The deficit on current account was covered in part by sales of fixed-rate bonds -- especially Federal securities -- abroad. In view of the D-Mark’s role as a reserve currency and the high creditworthiness of the Federal Republic of Germany as a borrower (triple A rating)  it is not -- and never has been -- a problem for Germany to raise funds abroad. German banks are among the premier credit institutions worldwide in all sectors of traditional banking business. In only a short period of time they have diversified into new areas of business (investment banking  derivatives  etc.); here  too  they have meanwhile established professional and efficient lines of business. This trend has been and is being accompanied by modernisations undertaken at the German stock exchanges  which are acquiring new structures  opening up new markets and  in doing so  consistently put their faith in the use of electronic systems. Concerning the speed  security and cost-effectiveness of securities trading  the German stock exchange Deutsche Börse leads the field. It has made rapid progress towards full computerisation and soon will offer a trading platform which will be trend-setting in the European context. The tool needed for this -- XETRA (Exchange Electronic Trading) is currently being implemented. The aim of XETRA is to facilitate full electronic handling of stock exchange trading with up to 40 000 securities -- with a worldwide remote membership facility. This will mean lower costs  more efficiency and a high degree of liquidity. In this context the centralised securities settlement system of Deutsche Börse Clearing AG  the leading German stock exchange clearing house  deserves a mention. Its functionality and speed  together with its cost-effective settlement procedures  are unmatched internationally. In Germany  settlement is generally completed within just two days (T+2) -- if necessary  even on the same day; that is faster than anywhere else. And  for the sake of security  they are working on cutting the time even further. The question of deregulation proved to be a less pressing problem in the traditionally liberal German financial market than in other countries; however  in Germany  too  further steps in this direction were necessary. Thus -- to cite just a few examples -- the securities transfer tax was abolished in 1990. Since 1992  foreign non-banks have been able to issue commercial paper denominated in D-Mark. BIS Review 99/1997 - 3 - In 1994 investors’ protection was reinforced by the establishment of the Federal Supervisory Office for Securities Trading and the legal ban on insider dealing. In 1994  too  genuine money market funds were admitted. In January 1997 minimum reserve requirements on repo transactions were abolished. In March 1997 the new stock exchange segment “New Market” was introduced for small and medium-sized fast-growing enterprises. Since May 1997  banks have been allowed to collateralise and sell loans in the form of asset-backed securities. Measured by the volume of securities outstanding  the German bond market is currently the third-largest debt securities market in the world. Within Europe it leads the field. Approximately 40 per cent of the German government bonds outstanding are held by foreign investors. This shows that the long-standing benchmark position of German Federal bonds rests on a sound real base. And it is surely not surprising either that  with a 42% market share  the trade in D-Mark-denominated interest-related products is the leading business in the European financial futures exchanges. Annual net sales of fixed-rate bonds issued by German borrowers amounted to the equivalent of more than US$ 100 billion in each of the past few years. The primary and the secondary markets exhibit a very high degree of liquidity  especially in respect of Federal securities. In order to maintain its leading position in the market  the Federal Government has gradually streamlined its array of issue instruments. Thus  the maturity range was complemented both at the short end (“Bubills”) and at the long end of the market (30-year bonds). The further fixing of issue dates has meanwhile led in effect to a regular issuance calendar over the entire year. The concentration on standardised instruments and regular issue dates  in combination with re-openings of issues  ensures large and liquid issue amounts. The introduction of stripping for Federal bonds is likewise part of the strategy to protect the Federal Government’s benchmark position. Whereas in the primary market the Government focuses on certain maturity segments  by allowing the stripping of government bonds it offers international institutional investors facilities for investment along the entire yield curve. BIS Review 99/1997 - 4 - Some regional Land governments in Germany have meanwhile started to combine their issues into joint bonds  which has proved to be rather successful. Another important segment of the German debt securities market is constituted by mortgage bonds (Pfandbriefe) which  as “jumbo” issues  have met with a positive response in the international capital market for some time now. The picture is complemented by the German Financial Futures Exchange (DTB). Although it was established relatively late  it has already conquered a major market position. In conjunction with MATIF in Paris and SOFFEX in Zurich  the DTB is seeking to build a joint continental European trading and clearing platform. Not least because of its efficient settlement and its electronic access facilities installed in foreign financial centres  the DTB offers global capital market players access to all derivative business. In its efforts to catch up with the longer-established futures exchanges  it has already made ground especially with the introduction of the Bobl future; in this respect  it has even surpassed LIFFE. The DTB’s range of products meanwhile cover maturities from one month to ten years. Contracts such as the 1-month and the 3-month Euro-Mark future and the future on 2-year Federal Treasury notes are the most recent examples of the DTB’s market orientation. 2. Further capital market improvements in the pipeline The launch of European monetary union will change the operating framework in Europe. Thus  the D-Mark will cease to exist as an internationally renowned reserve currency. For the emerging single currency area and the larger single financial market  a number of European Union directives will have to be incorporated into national law. You may rest assured that in doing so we will endeavour to further strengthen Germany as a financial centre. These measures are being supported by practical considerations aimed at smoothing the transition from the D-Mark to the euro for capital market players. The Federal Government will do justice to its leading position as an issuer also by converting its marketable old issues to euros right at the BIS Review 99/1997 - 5 - start of monetary union on January 1  1999. That will prevent any split in the market between D-Mark and euro-denominated Federal Government bonds. In other words  large and liquid euro issues covering the entire maturity range will be available from the outset. With regard to the conversion procedures  due consideration has to be given  among other things  to avoiding costs and to agreeing general practical rules in the interest of ensuring a smoothly functioning capital market. This includes a simple and relatively cost-effective concept for bonds in respect of the conversion of (even) D-Mark nominal amounts into (odd) euro amounts  i.e. the so-called 1-cent method. As far as equities are concerned  conversion is likely to be facilitated by the introduction of stock based not on par values  but on divisible units. Thus an instrument which has long been common in the United States will be established in Germany  too. To put it in a nutshell: the German capital market is itself in excellent shape and is or will be very well prepared for the future challenges. 3. Trends in other market sectors 3.1. Foreign exchange market The launch of monetary union in Europe will definitely have far-reaching consequences for the foreign exchange market  too. Monetary union will lead to the elimination of dealings in currencies belonging to the European Monetary System. On the other hand  the odds are that the remaining foreign exchange dealings will concentrate further within continental Europe in favour of Frankfurt. BIS Review 99/1997 - 6 - At a roughly constant level of trade in US dollars  German banks have been able to increase their operations in sterling  Swiss francs and yen distinctly already during the past few years. And further growth prospects look likely. Another cause of optimism is undoubtedly that Frankfurt will continue to be the location of one of the three central banks which issue the major international currencies  i.e. the US dollar  yen and euro. 3.2. Money market In the German money market  too  progress has been recorded in the past few years. And the Bundesbank has made a major contribution to that. The list is headed by the drastic lowering of the minimum reserve ratios to a level of 1.5% to 2.0% in several stages up to 1995. That has lessened the incentives to circumvent the regulations while preserving the instrument’s functional effectiveness. Since then the growth of short-term D-Mark-denominated deposits in the Euro-market has come to a halt. This effect has been reinforced by the exemption from minimum reserve requirements of liabilities under repo transactions with maturities of up to one year  which came into force at the beginning of this year. Within a short period of time this measure fostered the growth of a repo market in Germany and led to a shift of D-Mark-denominated repo business from the Euro-market  particularly London  back to Germany. The set of monetary policy instruments of the future European Central Bank are expected to incorporate key elements of the Bundesbank’s tried and tested toolkit. And I am convinced that even if the minimum reserve instrument is likewise employed  solutions will be found which exclude any negative effects on financial markets in the euro area  especially shifts to offshore financial centres. In comparison to the existing national markets  the money market in the euro area is likely to become considerably wider and deeper. The harmonisation of market practices which is currently being vigorously pursued will create a level playing field conducive to boosting competition. A European Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) is to be determined by a representative selection of banks from the euro area as the benchmark interest rate for the financial markets. It will enhance the profile of the European continent and of Frankfurt against London’s Euro-Libor. The EURIBOR will establish itself as a major benchmark for derivative financial instruments such as options  futures  floating-rate notes  etc. The fast  smooth and secure settlement of money market transactions is ensured by efficient payment systems. One of the linchpins of the Bundesbank’s payment system facility is the Frankfurt Electronic Clearing System (EAF 2). This system the liquidity-conserving elements of a net settlement procedure with the risk-reducing features of gross settlement systems. The second linchpin is the express electronic intercity credit transfer system known as EIL-ZV. This gross settlement system will constitute the interface to the ESCB’s TARGET system in stage 3 of EMU which links the national RTGS systems. Money market transactions within the euro area will then take just a few seconds. is exceptional it combines that in 4. Concluding remark Ladies and Gentlemen  as you can see  Finanzplatz Deutschland -- the German financial centre -- is entering the European competition from a good starting position. We are in favour of an open exchange with other financial centres in Europe and are looking forward to this competition. No one should have any doubt that our ambition is to remain the best in those fields which we already lead and to become the best in those fields in which we are still trailing at the moment.

Momentous changes in the financial markets The introduction of the euro is increasingly affecting expectations in the financial markets worldwide. We are little more than a year away from the start of the third stage of EMU on January 1  1999  as laid down in the Maastricht Treaty; and in about six months’ time the participating countries are to be selected. From the viewpoint of financial market players  a multitude of questions arise: What will be the role of the euro as an international currency? How strong (or how weak) will the future European currency be? And what changes will there be in the business environment of market players owing to the advent of the euro? Expecting reliable answers to these questions implies greatly overrating an economist’s capabilities. Trustworthy forecasts at times of a change of regime -- and the monetary union in Europe undoubtedly constitutes such a change - are  to say the least  extremely problematic  if not utterly impossible. Even so  the economist finds it appealing “to gaze into the future” and to ponder over possible patterns of development in terms of “informed guesses”. A conceivable starting point for such “brain-teasers” is the status quo: the role of the euro  as measured by the present position of potential EMU participants in the international financial markets and relative to the dollar. But the analysis must not stop at that point. EMU will trigger changes in the financial markets which have to be taken into account in any dynamic survey. The single currency will eliminate market fragmentation in Europe in the important area of currencies  and will enhance the intensity of competition in the financial sector. That will have a major impact on the position of the euro. But it is not only economic considerations that are of significance here  since the international role of a currency also depends crucially on political factors. It was not least political (i.e.  foreign policy) considerations that prompted a fresh start in the direction of EMU in the late 1980s. The very aim of monetary union was to “reduce dependency on the dollar” and “strengthen (the member states’) scope for monetary policy action”.1 A tripolar currency world is evidently what many people had (and some still have) in mind. The aim is for the euro to “compete as an international vehicular currency with the dollar and the yen on an equal footing”.2 The single currency will  it is claimed  finally give Europe its due weight in the concert of world powers. A rather cautious approach to the “key currency role”  such as was still widespread in Germany in the seventies  is not discernible in Europe at the political level. 1Genscher  H.D.

The euro as an international currency - 2 - Claiming a prominent role for a currency  even before it comes into being  is one part -- the easier one. The other  unquestionably much more difficult part  is realising that claim. What role the euro will actually play in the concert of major currencies will be decided  first and foremost  in the international financial markets. It is only when the economic preconditions are right that investors will be prepared to hold assets denominated in euros  only then that cross-border transactions outside the EU will be settled in euros on a significant scale  and only then that the euro will become an international currency. Expectations of the euro playing a major role in the international monetary system are chiefly predicated on the stability of the new currency. The euro must earn its position in the portfolios of public and private investors in competition with other currencies. That will hinge crucially on expected exchange rate movements relative to its major competitors -- above all  the US dollar. The key variables for exchange rate expectations are -- longer term -- anticipated inflation differentials  since a tendency for exchange rate movements to match purchasing power parity prevails in the long run. 3 the in Those wishing to establish the euro as an international currency would therefore do well to make the maintenance of price stability their primary goal. The external trend of the euro is inseparably linked to the prerequisite of internal stability -- stability begins at home. On the (often tacit) assumption that the anti-inflationary pre-conditions are met  widespread speculation is thriving at present about which market shares the euro might capture and whether there may be major portfolio shifts in the course of adjustment to the new conditions. Far-reaching conclusions are being drawn  in turn  as to the potential exchange rate trend of the euro. The starting point of these notions is the various functions performed by an international currency and the quantitative dimensions involved in the international financial markets. Specifically  this concerns the role of the euro - as a reserve currency - as an investment currency - as a transaction currency  and - as an anchor currency for exchange rate arrangements 2.1 The euro as a reserve currency World foreign currency reserves amounted to around US$1 500 billion at the end of June 1997. The lion’s share was accounted for by US dollar reserves (65%)  followed at a considerable distance by reserves denominated in Deutsche Mark (13%). Smaller shares were also accounted for by the yen and the currencies of other EU member states. 3See Deutsche Bundesbank  “Overall determinants of the trends in the real external value of the Deutsche Mark”  August 1995  pp. 17 - 37. BIS Review 100/1997 Upon entry into the third stage of monetary union (by 2002 at the latest)  all assets that are still denominated in currencies participating in EMU will be converted into euro assets; that will apply  in principle  to central banks’ asset holdings  too. From the point of view of the participating countries  “foreign currency reserves” denominated in these “in” currencies will become domestic euro assets. Considered in isolation  the euro’s potential as a reserve currency will therefore initially be lower than the market share of all “in” currencies taken together. Will third countries be able to fill that “gap”? For the “immediate neighbours” of the euro area  a major role will be played by the precise nature of the currency arrangement (i.e.  EMS II). The more closely the exchange rate is pegged to the euro  and the greater the recourse to intervention is  the higher the demand for euro reserves is likely to be in the countries in question -- at least during the period up to their entry into EMU. From the present perspective  it is not possible to make a definite prediction as to whether other countries outside the monetary union will  in future  hold part of their reserves in euros. Portfolio-theoretical considerations argue  in principle  for a diversification of foreign exchange reserves. That would open up opportunities for the euro. Ultimately  the investment decisions of central banks will hinge chiefly on their assessment of the future European currency’s stability. The question of how the roles of the US dollar or the yen as reserve currencies will be affected by the euro’s entry into the international financial markets is not all that easy to answer  either. On the one hand  shifts out of Deutsche Mark assets into US dollar assets are possible; that will apply -- as some anticipate -- to the introductory period in particular  when the euro’s reputation still has to be established. On the other hand  the overall global demand for currency reserves might fall  because some of the EMS-related need for currency reserves will no longer exist  and because the degree of openness of those economies which are linked to one another by monetary integration will decline in purely arithmetical terms.4 That is because part of what was previously foreign trade -- already characterised separately as “intra-trade” in the single market -- will then durably become internal trade from the monetary point of view. It is possible to conjecture that  for the group of participating countries  the “need” for currency reserves to cushion unforeseen events will not be as great as it is under the status quo of different currencies; this fall in demand is likely to affect the US dollar  in particular  primarily because the dollar has repeatedly played a major role in interventions in the EMS  too. It is not possible to state a priori what the ultimate outcome of these various effects will be on balance. In that respect  whether the other reserve currencies will benefit from the introduction of the euro  or not  must remain an open question. This applies all the more since a steeply rising share of global currency reserves is meanwhile being held by Asian central banks  which (at least up to now) have shown a preference for the US dollar. 2.2 The euro as an investment currency Although the reserve holdings of monetary authorities are certainly a major factor  trends in the financial markets are determined to a much greater extent by the decisions of private investors. Currency reserves are accompanied by international bank loans which are 4At present  over 60 % of EU foreign trade is accounted for by cross-border transactions with other member states. Assuming that all member states will (sooner or later) enter the third stage of EMU  the share of foreign trade in GDP on an average of all EU countries will fall to around 10 %  and will thus correspond roughly to the ratio for the United States. But even if all the member states do not adopt the single currency immediately  the internal orientation in the euro economic area will be greater than it is at present in the EU. BIS Review 100/1997 - 4 - (in net terms) more than three times as large and by international debt securities amounting to twice their size;5 on top of these  there are direct cross-border lending operations between non-banks that are not included in the above-mentioned international financial market data. The US dollar is the dominant investment currency  too. The Deutsche Mark accounts for less than 15% of international financial assets. It is precisely in the international financial markets that a large number of other potential participating currencies in EMU  taken together  have a significant share  too. (The share of the pound sterling  for example  is about 5%.) The structural changes in the international financial markets over the past 15 years  however  have been to the detriment of the US dollar  and have afforded the European currencies a rising market share. Theoretical considerations seem to suggest that this process might actually be reinforced by monetary union. A crucial factor determining the widespread international use of a currency is the degree of sophistication and openness of its financial markets. Financial markets that guarantee a wide range of products  a broad maturity range and a high level of market liquidity exercise a magnetic attraction internationally. If cross-border capital transactions are free of restrictions  funds are attracted  on the one hand  and  on the other  the currency concerned becomes available for borrowing by non-residents  too. In short  the international use of that currency is fostered. In that respect  the introduction of the euro is likely to have a further positive impact on capital markets within EMU. The currency-related segmentation of the markets will be eliminated  there will be a broader range of investment opportunities available  and the liquidity of the individual products will increase. Already  in the run-up to EMU  member states are gearing themselves to intensifying competition  and are “updating” both their financial markets and their financial instruments. In terms of its total volume  the euro bond market will probably be the second largest after the US dollar bond market; if all the EU member states ultimately participate in EMU  bonds denominated in euros will amount to around 60% of the volume of the US market. Even if the third stage starts with only a limited number of participants  the increase in the financial market’s efficiency will be important in fostering the euro. This effect would be reinforced if the larger euro currency area succeeded in dissociating itself more than previously from developments in the United States. On the other hand  the euro will face greater problems than the US dollar inasmuch as the euro will not have the backing of a centralised European government  and as it therefore still remains to be seen which securities will be able to perform a benchmark function in the euro bond market. 2.3 The euro as a transaction currency An international payment medium’s function as a transaction currency plays a role in transactions in goods and in foreign exchange trading. 5See BIS  International Banking and Financial Market Developments  Basle  August 1997. BIS Review 100/1997 There are no up-to-date and reliable figures on the worldwide invoicing shares of individual currencies in foreign trade. Estimates (for 1992) assume that about one-half of aggregate global exports are settled in US dollars  just over 15% in Deutsche Mark and around 6% each in French francs and pounds sterling.6 These figures should be put into perspective  however  since they are influenced to a great extent by individual countries’ respective shares in world trade; in general  every country has a comparatively large invoicing share of its own exports in domestic currency. If the figures are adjusted to allow for that effect  only the US dollar and the Deutsche Mark can be classed as “international invoicing currencies”. Since  as explained above  a considerable part of what is now foreign trade will become internal trade in the euro area under EMU  the euro is likely  if anything  to account for smaller market shares in “genuine foreign trade” in the first few years than the participating currencies do at present. In the longer term  however  it is quite possible to foresee the euro assuming growing importance  since it will be backed by a large economic area -- particularly as it is precisely in the case of invoicing currencies that market size is obviously a major factor.7 The economic advantages of invoicing in one’s own currency should not be overrated  however. Given short-term exchange rate fluctuations  it may be an advantage to settle in one’s own currency than in a foreign one. In the medium to long term  however  any exchange risks are to be borne by the counterparties  irrespective of the invoicing currency  in line with market conditions. Transaction currencies are often referred to in connection with their use in international foreign exchange trading. In order to facilitate bilateral transactions between different currencies in narrow markets  “vehicle currencies” have developed  through which foreign exchange market transactions are settled. After the US dollar  the Deutsche Mark is the most frequently employed currency in the foreign exchange markets -- in particular  as a vehicle in transactions between European currencies.8 How important the euro is in foreign exchange trading will hinge crucially on its market shares as an investment and reserve currency  as well as on its role as a potential anchor currency in Europe. If it does establish itself in those areas  it certainly has the potential to go on to become a major transaction currency in foreign exchange trading  albeit without being able to deprive the US dollar of significant market shares in the short term. Under those conditions  it is likewise predestined to become a vehicle currency for transactions in other European currencies. It is also clear  however  that a major segment of European foreign exchange trading will cease to exist as a result of the merging of currencies. 2.4 The euro as an anchor currency The last function of the euro which is to be scrutinised -- and to which I have already referred -- is that of being an anchor in the international monetary system. There is no longer merely speculation to rely on in that area  as some of the broad outlines are already taking shape. An exchange rate arrangement with the euro at its centre is envisaged for those EU countries which are not going to participate in the single currency from the outset. Above and 6See ECU Institute (ed.)  International Currency Competition and the Future Role of the Single European Currency  London 1995  p. 70. 7The EU is larger than the United States in terms of its population  and more or less on an equal footing in terms of GDP and foreign trade. 8See BIS  Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivative Market Activity  Basle  May 1996. BIS Review 100/1997 - 6 - beyond that  orientation to the euro is to be expected  above all  in the countries of central and eastern Europe  either in the form of unilateral pegging exclusively to the euro or by gearing exchange rate policy to a basket of currencies in which the euro has a heavy weighting. The euro will be highly attractive to potential candidates for accession to monetary union  in particular. 3. Some reflections on the external value of the Euro The introduction of the euro represents a radical change in the international monetary system. It will call into question positions in world financial markets which have developed over a period of decades; the conditions which obtain at present in global financial markets can serve  at most  as rough guidelines for the moment of conversion to euros. Which direction future trends will take -- and this is an important implication of the preceding section -- cannot be readily predicted in every case  as different forces are at work. That applies to monetary reserves and to private financial assets alike. And it also applies to the external value of the euro. The analysis has shown that  especially in the initial stages  the euro will have to build up a reputation of being a trustworthy currency. This is occasionally interpreted as implying that a weakness of the euro is to be expected initially. Diametrically opposed to this hypothesis are the forecasts which prophesy a considerable appreciation potential for the euro on account of expected massive shifts in international portfolios owing to the increasing efficiency of the financial markets in Europe and possible diversification advantages  with interest rates being only weakly correlated with other currencies. Both these arguments seem to me to fall short of the truth. Certainly  a high degree of uncertainty can be expected in the early stages of EMU. However  the ECB  given its independence and single-minded commitment to the objective of price stability  deserves a measure of confidence in advance. That applies all the more as -- viewed from the present vantage point -- the starting conditions for EMU  with low inflation rates in virtually all potential participating countries  are decidedly favourable. Risks to the euro are to be seen  rather  in the general political environment  where in some quarters -- with an eye on the high level of unemployment in Europe -- talk of a weak euro is widespread. However  (verbal) exchange rate manipulations will serve neither to solve the serious employment problems nor to establish the euro as an internationally respected currency. The high level of unemployment in Europe is largely structural and can only be overcome by energetic  far-reaching reforms -- for which responsibility lies more or less entirely at the national level. The hope that EMU will make a lasting contribution to reducing unemployment should rest on the expectation of low interest rates and a high level of investment. These  in turn  depend crucially on investors’ confidence in the long-term stability of the euro. The misuse of the currency for employment (or trade) policy purposes would not only jeopardise price stability in the euro area  it might also provoke retaliation from other countries. This  after all  would be of no use to anybody. Some commentators are inferring from an expected substitution of euro for dollar-denominated assets that the single currency will have a substantial appreciation potential. Such thinking is predicated on a portfolio structure that is in line with other macroeconomic benchmarks  such as the ratio to GDP or the share of the euro area in world trade. In my view  these rather mechanistic approaches take too little account of the supply side in the financial markets. The broader and deeper European financial market will not only attract investment capital  it will also result in enhanced cross-border borrowing in euros  which  in itself  tends to BIS Review 100/1997 dampen rates.9 Which effect will prevail in the end  and what the consequent time profile will be for the movement of the euro rate relative to other currencies  can hardly be forecast reliably a priori. In the long run -- as already stated -- relative inflation differentials will largely determine the nominal euro rate. 4. Concluding remarks The statute of the ECB -- above all  central bank independence and the priority given to the objective of price stability -- establishes crucial prerequisites for a stable euro at the institutional level. It is now up to those responsible to fill this monetary constitution with life  to implement its targets in the real world. Especially in the difficult start-up phase  it will be important to appoint the right people -- people who are regarded in the public eye  and particularly in the financial markets  as guarantors of a stability-oriented monetary policy. Any lack of confidence in the management of the ECB would be reflected in corresponding risk premiums on interest rates  and hence might cost the participants in EMU dear. Thus we come full circle: the political objective of establishing the euro as an international currency will be attained only if the market accepts the newcomer. Investors  for their part  will prefer a strong euro  which presupposes stability within EMU. That is a challenge to the ECB  but the other economic policy players  especially the fiscal policy makers  must likewise do their bit to (continue to) keep inflationary risks as low as possible. 9For a critical discussion see also McCauley  P.N.

Wellink  at the XXI European meeting of the Trilateral Commission in The Hague on 25/10/97.,Mr. Wellink discusses recent developments in the Dutch economy Address given by the President of the Netherlands Bank  Dr. A.H.E.M. Wellink  at the XXIst European meeting of the Trilateral Commission in The Hague on 25/10/97. Recent success As you all know  the Dutch economy has been doing remarkably well lately. Over the past three years  Dutch GDP has grown by an annual average of 3%  i.e.  considerably more than was the case in most major continental European countries. For this year and the next  the prospects for growth are even better. Growth has furthermore been attended by considerable job creation  averaging nearly 100 000 man-years per annum  or 1.8%  since 1995. The Dutch unemployment figure has consequently dropped to around 6%. All this is in sharp contrast to the picture presented by most countries on the continent of Europe. Until very recently  they were seeing no more than a moderate cyclical recovery. Still  this year the growth of output in these countries would seem to be accelerating substantially. This has not yet  unfortunately  fed through to the employment situation. In Germany and France  for instance  unemployment is expected to rise even further this year. The unemployment figure there is about twice that in the Netherlands. The Dutch upturn has drawn widespread attention  and has come to be known in some circles as the Dutch model. In my speech today  I will guide you through the roots of the Dutch success. Let me start by saying that the recent favourable economic development is definitely not a miracle. It simply boils down to sound macro-economic policies and deregulation  in particular of labour markets (including some country-specific deregulation policies). Every country in the world can effectively copy it. The implementation of these policies was possible because of a broad consensus in the Netherlands on their necessity. This is lacking in many of our neighbouring countries. But to my mind this consensus among all relevant parties was not caused by the so-called consensus model -- on the contrary. The consensus emerged after the consultative framework -- which had led to paralysis in the 1970s -- was made much leaner. I will come back to that later. Let my first give you an overview of the facts and figures surrounding the so-called “Dutch miracle”. Making up for lost ground To see the developments of the last few years in their proper perspective  we must take a look at the situation in the early 1980s. In those years  Dutch business was in serious trouble. The international recession  when it struck  hit the Netherlands much harder than its neighbours  because in the 1970s business sector profitability here had been structurally eroded by excessive rises in wage costs and the consequent deterioration of competitiveness. A vicious circle of labour shake-out set in  leading -- via the social security system -- to higher social insurance contributions and thus contributing to further job destruction. The problem was compounded by an inappropriate policy reaction to the two oil crises  in the form of an expansive budget leading to unsustainable deficits (of over 10% of GDP) and  after some delay  to soaring central government indebtedness. The figures show only too clearly that in those years the Netherlands was much worse off than other countries. In 1970  the Netherlands had still held the sixth place in Europe in terms of per capita GDP (10% above the European average). But by 1988 it had fallen to below that average  and the Netherlands had dropped to the eleventh place. Looking at the BIS Review 100/1997 - 2 - figures for subsequent years  we see that the Netherlands has since regained some of the ground which it had lost earlier. In 1996  per capita GDP held the seventh place (at nearly 5% above the European average). A similar pattern is in evidence for the employment situation; between 1972 and 1983  job losses were much worse than in the rest of Europe. But here the relative recovery set in around 1985. In other words  the Dutch success has until now been no more than an exercise in making up for ground lost earlier. In fact  we still have not caught up with Europe in all respects. Explanatory factors In my view  the turnaround which began in 1982-1983 can be ascribed to a combination of sound macroeconomic policy  as well as specific measures aimed at improving the operation of markets. • The gradual restructuring of public finance  starting in 1982 and resulting in a deficit of 2.1% of GDP in 1997  compares favourably with those of most countries in the vicinity. The introduction of real expenditure ceilings at the start of this Cabinet has proved instrumental to this success. Also  the better control of the budgetary process contributed to the outcome. It is gratifying that our efforts to achieve healthier public finances have mainly taken the form of expenditure cuts. The cuts have also made it possible to alleviate the burden of taxation and social insurance contributions. The positive evaluation made by the ECOFIN Council this spring is a good incentive to strive over the next few years for a balanced budget. I will be going into the need for that later. • The fact that since 1983 monetary policy has given absolute priority to stability of the guilder/Deutsche mark exchange rate is another contributing factor. That has enabled us to import  as it were  the usually favourable price climate prevailing in Germany. Because of moderate wage developments at home  this exchange rate policy provided for real exchange rate stability as well  resulting in a favourable competitive position of our business sector. This contrasted sharply with Germany  where excessive wage increases during the reunification boom contributed to a substantial real appreciation of the German mark of about 12% between 1990 and 1995. The real guilder appreciation was instead negligible. The policy also enhanced confidence in the financial markets  which in turn contributed to a sustained decline of (the risk premium contained in) interest rates. For over a decade  Dutch capital market rates have been among the lowest in Europe  making for an improved investment climate as well. • The wage restraint -- I mentioned it already -- ensuing from the much cited accord of Wassenaar (1982) was the third factor. This entailed a trade-off between the employers’ organizations and the trade unions  the latter relinquishing automatic price compensation for a shorter working week. A condition was that business costs should not increase. It was furthermore agreed that wage negotiations would be decentralized. The process of wage moderation was boosted further by the government-initiated alleviation of taxation and social insurance contributions. In the longer term  the results can be seen to be truly impressive. Over the past fifteen years  unit wage costs have remained well-nigh stable in the Netherlands  allowing a recovery of profitability  and an the business sector’s competitiveness. improvement of • The economy has moved towards greater market orientation  a goal which has been high on the political agenda since the beginning of the 1990s. The labour market was the first to be targeted  with social security legislation being amended to give the market mechanism greater leeway. In the period from 1983 to 1990  minimum wages and social insurance benefits had BIS Review 100/1997 been delinked from the general development of wages. A wide range of measures was directed at the lower end of the labour market  the aim being to stimulate businesses to employ low-skilled personnel by way of a reduction of social insurance contributions payable by employers  wage cost subsidies and subsidized jobs. Furthermore  society has come to accept flexible forms of labour  such as part-time working and temporary staffing  which have boosted the expansion of the number of jobs in the services sector. In this respect  the Netherlands holds a vanguard position internationally  with 40% of all work now being done on flexible contracts. Not only does this greater flexibility meet the needs of the business sector  employees  too  seem to find it suits their changing preferences. Global calculations show that the potential employment gains for other countries  if part-time jobs had developed to the same extent as in the Netherlands  could be sizeable (around 3 million jobs in both Germany and France). These calculations are highly mechanical and therefore one should be cautious in interpreting the outcome. Nevertheless  I think that part-time work arrangements could be helpful in addressing a serious unemployment situation  under strict conditions  i.e.  they are applied tailor-made and do not increase businesses’ operating costs. So far the main result in the area of product market improvement has been the 1996 liberalization of the statutory establishment rules for businesses. With boundaries disappearing and new technology being developed all the time  we cannot but go with the grain of the market on an increasing scale. We must always keep in mind that all countries around us are doing exactly the same thing. Introducing new rules and amending old ones may be painful at first  apart from being time-consuming  but there seems to be nothing for it but to go on doing so  if we wish to maintain our prosperity in the longer term. With so much praise being heaped on the Netherlands and its consensus economy  people tend to forget that consensus about how a recovery should be brought about did not materialize out of the blue; in fact  it was enforced by the unfavourable economic developments during the 1980-81 recession  which  as I noted before  hit us much harder than others. Ultimately  it was that very fact which compelled the employers’ organizations and the trade unions to give up their entrenched views  views which had been characteristic of the 1970s. That episode illustrates only too vividly that having a consultative framework for employers and employees does not guarantee fruitful negotiations. The consultative process has been streamlined in the meantime. One could say that the “consensus model” of the 1970s has given way to the consensus of the 1990s. Where do we go from here? For all our fifteen years of conducting a policy aimed at recovery  we cannot afford to indulge in complacency. Things may be going in the right direction  but we still have several major long-standing problems to see to: • First  there is the continued high rate of economic inactivity. The low participation rate of our population in general is a major factor underlying our internationally modest position in terms of prosperity. This applies especially to the older members of the labour force. More than half of those aged between 50 and 65 do not hold a job. We should really be seeking to reduce our rate of economic inactivity to the levels prevailing in neighbouring countries. • Secondly  there is our considerable public debt. Although it has been falling in recent years  our debt ratio (of over 70% of GDP) continues to be more than 10 percentage points above the EMU criterion. A rapid further reduction to well below 60% is called for if we wish to be able to cope with the growing burden which the imminent ageing of the population will impose on public finance. In addition  as we have seen in the past  high debts make us more BIS Review 100/1997 - 4 - vulnerable in the event of interest rate rises. European interest rates are currently low  but they will not stay that way for ever. Our fundamentals are favourable. One major advantage is our structurally high savings surplus  indicating that macro-economically there are no financial impediments to higher growth. Furthermore  we seem to have scope for further growth  provided we succeed in harnessing the current labour reserve. To complete our recovery  we will need further budgetary restructuring and continue on the path toward greater market orientation. Policy conclusions This brings me to the concluding part of my speech: what can we learn from the Dutch experience? There are five lessons which can be drawn from it. Firstly  monetary stability is an important ingredient of a stable economic climate. However  not only nominal but also real exchange rate stability matters. If relative price and labour cost developments are out of line  a country’s competitiveness is seriously affected  even if the nominal exchange rate remains stable. This is an important lesson with a view to EMU when nominal exchange rate stability is a given factor. Secondly  sound budgetary policy is not only about deficit reduction and cutting expenditure. It is about redefining the role of the public sector in an economy. Thirdly  more market pays off. We should not forget that the private sector is the engine of our economy. So why not give the market sector more leeway? Of course  always on the basis of a good analysis of what can and can’t be done by the market. The fourth lesson is related to the latter. Policies geared at increasing labour market flexibility work. However  it is important to note that -- as far as labour market policies is concerned -- there is no overall recipe which can be applied. Policies should be tailor-made depending on frictions on certain parts of the labour market. Last  but not least -- and related to the fourth lesson -- reduction in working hours can  under conditions  play an important role in an economy. In the short term  it simply boils down to a redistribution of work  without affecting the performance of an economy. However  redistribution of work can (in return for moderate wage claims) contribute to the necessary consensus between employee and employers organizations in an economy. And the latter does improve the performance of the economy in the longer run  as the Dutch experiences teach us. To conclude  there is not really anything new under the sun. The combination of economic policies which the Netherlands have opted for have been advised by -- for instance -- the International Monetary Fund for a long period. The issue is how to make society embark on these policies; in other words  how to create consensus. Not by forcing all relevant parties into a stalemate  but by creating an awareness that a certain combination of policies -- the five lessons which I mentioned before -- is beneficial for all parties involved.

I should like to thank the Committee for the invitation to discuss the Swedisheconomy and the current situation for monetary policy. In my opening remarks today I shall begin by briefly summarising the recent years’ economic tendencies and then consider the present construction Sweden’s economy is now entering the fifth year of expansion since the profound of monetary policy. A look into the future will conclude. What I have to say is based on the latest crisis at the beginning of the decade. Since GDP turned upwards in the summer of 1993  annual growth has averaged over 2.5 per cent. Annual inflation in this period has averaged only about 2 per cent. This is a marked contrast with the 1970s and 1980s  when annual growth averaged approximately 2 per cent and inflation about 8 per cent. In one respect  however  the situation to date is still dismal  namely as regards the labour market and employment. If an economy is growing well but employment remains weak and unemployment high  there is a strong probability that the labour market is affected by structural problems. inflation report and events since it was published. From a dual situation to broader expansion Although growth in recent years has been satisfactory  the generation of a broader upswing in the economy has proved difficult. Initially  about three-quarters of the GDP’s increase came from manufacturing  which represents only about 20 per cent of Sweden’s economy. This meant that bottlenecks occurred fairly quickly  accompanied by various types of inflationary impulses. Our relatively small industrial sector cannot be expected to sustain a growth rate that is higher than the total economy achieved in the 1970s and 1980s. The problem with the dual economy -- a flourishing export-related industrial sector and a rather weak recovery in sectors with a more domestic orientation -- stemmed in part from low confidence in economic policy’s determination and ability to keep inflation low in the longer run. This in turn was a consequence of Sweden’s poor record in this respect  coupled with serious problems with government finances. Long bond rates fluctuated widely and in 1994 and 1995 they actually climbed to the levels of the years of high inflation. The exchange rate continued along its depreciating path from the 1970s and 1980s. For the Riksbank  the lack of confidence in the direction of economic policy left little room for manoeuvre. Although the instrumental rate was lowered during the spring of 1994  virtually all the market rates and particularly those for longer maturities rose. Sweden was approaching a point where economic policy had to demonstrate that the focus on stability was a firm commitment. The monetary tightening and  perhaps to an even greater extent  the fiscal consolidation gradually generated increased confidence in Sweden’s readiness and ability to achieve low long-term inflation. Against this background  during 1996 it was possible to cut the repo rate to its lowest level since the early 1960s. Low inflation and decreased inflation expectations also contributed to falling bond rates  accompanied by an appreciation of the krona from the earlier lows. Since December 1996 the repo rate has been unchanged at 4.10 per cent. All in all  conditions were gradually created for a broader economic upswing. With the time lag that generally applies in economic policy  during 1997 we have observed a mood swing among households  leading for instance to increased private consumption  while export growth has BIS Review 101/1997 - 2 - been maintained. The Swedish economy is entering a phase of high activity with a combination of strong domestic demand and strong export growth. The impact of the Riksbank’s current monetary stance will take about two years to materialise in full. We therefore have to assess the outlook for inflation as far ahead as in 1999. Such an analysis was presented some weeks ago in the inflation report. I shall be returning shortly to that report and subsequent developments but first I want to discuss the approach in principle to the conduct of monetary policy over the complete economic cycle. Monetary policy in a cyclical perspective A matter that savers and investors are currently discussing is not whether but when the Riksbank will raise the instrumental rate. An expected increase in the repo rate is also indicated by the structure of market rates. The general impression among financial agents seems to be that a repo rate increase is probable some time in the coming winter. The timing of a change in the monetary stance is determined by the Riksbank’s assessment of inflation. The simple rule of thumb for the Riksbank can be formulated as follows: if the assessment of inflation  given an unchanged instrumental rate  points to a rate of inflation one to two years ahead that is in line with the target  then the monetary stance is well balanced. If the assessment indicates a risk of inflation rising above (falling below) the target  then the monetary stance is too expansive (contractive) and the repo rate should therefore be raised (lowered). The time has not yet come for an increase in the repo rate  but when it does  our action will hopefully be seen as a natural ingredient of a monetary policy for price stability. Our ambition is to take predictable and timely measures so that sizeable interest rate movements can be avoided. Still  it is hardly surprising that the direction of monetary policy is being discussed. At present Swedish monetary policy’s overall impact can be described as expansionary at a time when activity is becoming stronger. The short-term real interest rate is between 2 and 2.5 per cent  depending on the exact maturity and how inflation expectations are measured. How a neutral monetary stance translates into the short real rate is difficult to determine precisely but it can be said that the current rate is comparatively low  with an impact on total demand that should be stimulatory. In addition  the level of the real exchange rate is weak in relation to a reasonable long-term equilibrium. This means that its effect is stimulatory  too. The combined effect of the short interest rate and the exchange rate is therefore tending to support the economic upswing. All else equal  an expansionary monetary stance leads to a successive acceleration of demand. In time  this may generate a growth rate that exceeds the economy’s long-term potential. The ability of the economy to cope with a high demand trend is not unlimited. As unutilised resources are activated and the output gap closes  bottlenecks of various kinds arise in the labour market or in real capital. It is in such a situation that inflation may accelerate. In order to avoid the occurrence of shortages and accelerating inflation  the monetary stance must not remain too expansive for too long in an upward phase. Instead  a timely adjustment -- bearing in mind the lag associated with monetary policy -- must be made to a more neutral position before the output gap closes. This promotes a continued growth of demand at a rate the economy can absorb -- for instance with the help of new investment  improved efficiency and labour supply -- without generating inflationary bottlenecks. The purpose of such a monetary adjustment is not to break the expansionary trend but to achieve growth that is more sustainable. In BIS Review 101/1997 - 3 - other words  a shift from an expansionary stance to one that is more neutral is designed to bring the economy onto the growth path that matches its structure -- not to bring growth to a halt. Neither should this be described as a contractive turn; it is rather a move that yields a less expansionary stance. In the public debate the Riksbank’s monetary policy is sometimes described as though repo rate adjustments were a form of “punishment” or “reward”  aimed at measures that have been taken either by the political system or by labour market organisations in connection with wage negotiations. My point here has been that interest rate adjustments are a natural feature of monetary policy’s path over the economic cycle. Of course this does not mean that the construction of monetary policy is not affected by fiscal expansion or contraction  or by low or high wage settlements. What I want to make clear is that adjustments to the instrumental rate in the course of the economic cycle are a natural phenomenon and their purpose is to create conditions for sustained growth and low inflation. If a central bank waits too long before shifting from an expansive to a more neutral monetary stance  problems with bottlenecks are liable to become more widespread and the economy may become overheated. Besides entailing rising inflation  this causes firms and households to start accustoming themselves to a high level of inflation. Monetary policy may then be forced to adopt a contractive stance in order to bring inflation back to the target rate. So if the central bank waits too long  the interest rate increases may be all the larger. In the meantime  moreover  economic imbalances and tensions may become so great that they lead to economic setbacks. We are familiar with such a course of events from the 1970s and 1980s  and perhaps not least from the early 1990s. Against this background  in situations when capacity is coming under pressure  it is clearly better for a central bank to act at an early stage. Future inflation The assessment in the inflation report  published just over a month ago  is that growth in the Swedish economy will be about 2 per cent in 1997 and around 3 per cent in 1998. In 1999  the rate is expected to go on accelerating to just over 3 per cent. This assessment envisages that  in an expanding world market  export growth remains relatively high. This is accompanied by an accelerating increase in private consumption  while public consumption at least stops falling. Economic growth in Sweden in 1998 and 1999 would then most probably exceed the potential rate  which is estimated to be just over 2 per cent in annual terms. The broad rise in all the major demand components will therefore gradually exert pressure on the available resources. This successive increase in resource utilisation is already evident in some indicators. A growing proportion of firms are reporting  for example  that output is being restricted by productive factors rather than by demand. The gap between total demand and total resources for production is an important but elusive indicator of inflationary pressure. The Riksbank considers that the output gap  which is an attempt to measure the degree of unutilised resources in the total economy  is 2 per cent of GDP. With the GDP forecast from the inflation report  this means that the gap will narrow by degrees and close some time during 1999  in any event towards the end of that year. In the light of the assessments of resource utilisation and other factors  in the inflation report the Riksbank forecast that the annual increase in the CPI will be around 1 per cent in 1997 and around 2 per cent in both 1998 and 1999  with some upward tendency in the latter two years. This is our main scenario. BIS Review 101/1997 - 4 - Like most other forecasts  however  inflation assessments are subject to uncertainty. Our forecasts as a foundation for monetary policy therefore do not consist of single point estimates of future inflation. In practice we construct a number of alternative outcomes and assess their probabilities. Normally there is one main scenario and two alternatives. Economic activity could be stronger than we have envisaged  so that inflation is somewhat higher; but it could also be weaker  giving lower inflation. Most of the evidence suggests  however  that since the inflation report  an outcome which is appreciably weaker than the main scenario has become less likely. The forecasts for all the demand components are naturally uncertain. It is  however  particularly worth discussing the forecast for private consumption  since this component represents about one-half of total demand. Some factors suggest that the growth of private consumption could become stronger than most observers count on today. The background here is that for a number years the growth of household disposable income has been held back by fiscal consolidation. After 1998  however  the direct restrictive fiscal impact on household finances is expected to diminish. But in spite of the weak or negative income trend  private consumption has already been rising for a number of years  albeit rather slowly. The reason is that  besides the effect of income on private consumption  spending by households  as well as their view of the future  is influenced by the increase in wealth. Households have recently become appreciably more optimistic about the future. House prices and share prices have been rising markedly for some years. The realised and latent capital gains of households in 1997 add up to the equivalent of about 25 per cent of their income  a figure that is as high as in the late 1980s. It would be surprising if such an increase in wealth did not contribute sooner or later to higher consumer demand. The key question  however  is how rapidly private consumption will grow. The above applies provided the increase in asset prices is maintained. Since share prices turned upwards in the autumn of 1992  the increase on the Stockholm Exchange has been one of the largest since the early 1920s  which is as far back as the statistics go. The overall valuation of corporate profits is also historically high. The present level of share prices calls for a further rapid increase in profits for several years to come. Minor changes in this picture of the future could affect current share prices. Another element of uncertainty concerns the economy’s supply side. We cannot be sure of just how much the economy can produce without an increase in inflation. Moreover  it is not only the total reserve of resources that may affect inflation. The rate at which resource utilisation rises may also be important. A rapid activation of the unutilised resources could generate stronger inflationary impulses even if surplus capacity still exists at total level. CPI inflation has moved up sharply during 1997. The 12-month change was down around 0 per cent for a couple of months last spring but after that it moved up fairly quickly to 1.9 per cent for September. In September alone the CPI rose 0.9 per cent  which was more than most observers had expected. The figure also aroused some uncertainty among savers and investors. The question is whether the increase in inflation represents a new and unforeseen tendency. The main features of this development are not unexpected. One factor behind the rising CPI is increased indirect taxes  for instance for tobacco  and higher administered prices. Another explanation is that the impact on the CPI from the falling interest rates in 1996-1997 is diminishing. All in all  this means that the CPI is closing in on underlying inflation as measured in various ways by the Riksbank. BIS Review 101/1997 - 5 - Still  the CPI outcome for September is somewhat higher than the Riksbank had counted on. Figures for a single month admittedly do not warrant definite conclusions but it is certainly important to pay heightened attention to price movements in the coming months. Normally it is underlying or trend inflation that is primarily of interest for monetary policy. This holds unless transitory price effects influence inflation expectations. In a setting where inflation expectations are firmly anchored to the inflation target  monetary policy has some room for manoeuvre. But if expected inflation starts to rise  we must be on the alert  particularly in that the current monetary stance is stimulatory. The importance of expected inflation for price and wage formation was evident not least in connection with the 1995 round of wage negotiations. At that time  expectations of future inflation seem to have been a bit above 4 per cent  which probably contributed to the excessively high level of the ensuing wage agreements. Now that the Swedish economy is on the threshold of very important wage negotiations  there must be no doubt that the Riksbank is truly serious about the inflation target. Future wage formation is yet another risk factor that the Riksbank has to consider. There are some encouraging signs that wage formation is moving in the right direction  even though the parties have gone in for a certain amount of bidding. This tends to be a process that conveys a varying degree of realism. It is important to bear in mind that wage formation is not just a matter of the level of wage agreements. The outcome for wages is also conditioned by the wage drift that mirrors labour supply and demand. The less efficiently the labour market works  the sooner bottlenecks arise that generate increased wage drift. Tendencies to labour shortages in certain sectors are already discernible  despite the high unemployment. Conclusion: monetary stance well balanced; changes in the spectrum of risks A monetary policy that aims for sustained price stability is not at odds with good economic growth. This presupposes that the supply side functions so well that growth does not give rise to inflationary impulses. But if the structure of the economy is such that only moderate growth is feasible  demand and accordingly the monetary stance must be adjusted accordingly. The alternative is demand growth that exceeds what the economy is capable of producing without inflationary bottlenecks. Accelerating inflation is a threat to sustainable growth and may even result in serious economic setbacks  as history has taught us. As economic activity becomes stronger and monetary policy adjusts its sights on the future picture  the Riksbank’s monetary stance will have to gradually move away from its current expansionary position. The timing of such a move has to be assessed in the light of new information and today one cannot say when it will happen. Our present assessment is that the monetary stance is well balanced. There has been some shift in the spectrum of risks but our inflation forecast for the coming years is unchanged. BIS Review 101/1997

I. The “American Express Company” is not only a financial institution  but also a brand- name familiar throughout the world. The “American Express credit card” and “American Express travellers’ cheque” are acknowledged in most countries as safe and convenient means of payment  which facilitate not just travel. For decades past  therefore  “American Express” has been a symbol of increasing globalisation. There are not many other enterprises that can claim that. Today  however  I do not want to talk about payment instruments. Even so  my reference to the travellers’ cheque takes us straight to our topic: alongside the “greenback”  the travellers’ cheque is likewise a symbol of the dollar’s status as the absolute Number One among the currencies of the world. II. A currency which serves at the same time as a unit of account  a medium of exchange and a store of value -- for private investors and public monetary authorities alike -- is known as an international key currency. What are the pre-requisites that a national payment medium needs  in order to assume these functions? Monetary history teaches us that the international role of a currency may often develop spontaneously with the country’s political and economic significance. Hence it is not surprising that  besides gold  the pound sterling played the overriding role in the international monetary system for many decades. A well-functioning banking system and efficient capital markets had evolved in the United Kingdom at an early date. The industrial revolution began in Great Britain  and helped the British economy to gain an edge over all other countries. The role of sterling was primarily based on the UK’s position as a great power  in both economic and political terms. What is more  over a period of two centuries sterling did not depreciate against other currencies. Once the significance of sterling started to decline  the dollar took the stage as the principal international currency. This was due not only to the US’ rise to the status of a world power. Another important factor was that  for a long period  the dollar was far less exposed to inflationary pressures than other currencies. By virtue of the Bretton Woods system  the US dollar became the official key currency in 1944. It served national central banks as a benchmark currency  an intervention currency and a reserve currency alike. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system  and given the domestic stability problems in the United States  the dollar forfeited that formal function. Even so  it retained a leading role. As before  the United States remains the world’s leading industrial and trading nation. That is why dollars are so highly acceptable worldwide. Moreover  the magnitude of the US financial market ensures a wide variety of investment options. The decontrol of exchange rates  the increasing freedom of capital movements and diverging stability records are the reason why other currencies  such as the Deutsche Mark  have been BIS Review 101/1997 - 2 - able to establish themselves alongside the dollar -- albeit on a far more modest scale. After all  currencies  too  compete to an increasing extent for the favour of the international transactor. Besides economic significance  a dynamic economy and a sufficiently large economic area (duly integrated in world trade)  it is primarily monetary conditions that must be met. An international key currency must be able to exhibit a successful stability record over a lengthy period. While the markets may forgive short-lived slips  long-term failures are penalised. The markets’ memory often stretches back a surprisingly long way. They heed the faintest signs that a currency’s stability may be at risk. It is that which makes the credibility that the responsible monetary authority enjoys all the more important. It has transpired that such credibility increases with the degree of independence from government instructions. If a central bank has to serve two masters  namely monetary stability and the promotion of economic activity  it usually comes to grief in both areas. Then its credibility is compromised for a long while. III. The introduction of the euro marks a watershed  not only for the monetary situation in Europe but also for the global monetary system. Little more than a year before its planned introduction  the world’s financial markets are now wondering: will the new currency be strong or weak? Can it become a serious alternative to the dollar as a reserve  investment and transaction currency? In Europe  great economic and political hopes are being pinned on the euro. The old continent is to be strengthened as a global economic power  European integration is to be fostered. It is hoped that it will be possible to cope more effectively with the challenges posed by globalisation. Moreover  many people are hoping that the euro will constitute a significant counterweight to the pre-eminent dollar. That is what Jacques Chirac  the French President  said recently in an interview he gave to a German news magazine. But the crucial factor will be whether the euro turns out to be sustainably stable  and what the market expectations in that respect are. The institutional conditions for a stability-oriented monetary policy in Europe are pretty well assured  thanks to the Maastricht Treaty and the independent central bank envisaged therein. However  a good deal will also depend on the appointments to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank. Independence chiefly means the independence of individuals. Among the European central bank governors in the European Monetary Institute  there is a broad consensus today about monetary policy objectives and strategy. That consensus must be preserved in the European Central Bank. That applies also to the view that internal stability has priority over external stability. The external value of the euro is inseparably associated with the precondition of internal stability: “stability begins at home”. But the crucial event for the new currency will be the convergence examination in the spring of 1998  and the selection of the participating countries. Only countries with virtually identical stability orientations and sufficiently sound public financial positions right from the start can accede to a durably stable monetary union. The selection of the participating countries is therefore a matter of paramount importance. The vital issue is the sustainability of the convergence achieved and the necessary adaptability of the participating economies to the constantly changing challenges. In this connection  special attention will be focused on Germany and France  since monetary union is almost inconceivable without the participation of either of these countries. BIS Review 101/1997 - 3 - However  the task of achieving and maintaining convergence in anti-inflation policy does not apply merely at the time of entry into monetary union. Even after that  the policy mix must be right. This is because  in the monetary union  we shall be pursuing a single monetary policy  but at the same time largely national economic  financial and social policies. When adopting the Stability and Growth Pact in Amsterdam in June 1997  the participating states undertook “immediately to take corrective budgetary action if there are signs of any considerable departure from the objectives of the stability and convergence programmes  and particularly from the medium-term budgetary target of a nearly balanced or in-surplus budget  or if an excessive deficit is in prospect.” That is a far-reaching undertaking. In the event of excessive deficits  the Stability and Growth Pact provides that the European Council should automatically impose sanctions. The sanction mechanism is designed not only to foster confidence but also to protect the single currency from unbridled public deficits and to prevent conflicts between monetary and fiscal policy. It sets strict limits to national financial policy. IV. An international key currency generally has to assume the function of an anchor currency. The markets expect it. In the present EMS this function has been  and is being  performed by the Deutsche Mark. In the case of EMS II  the exchange rate arrangement for those countries which are not participating in the single currency from the outset  the euro is to perform this function of an anchor currency. Furthermore  in future a strong orientation towards the euro is to be expected  particularly in central and eastern European countries. The euro will exert a strong attraction  especially on potential candidates for admission to the monetary union -- at any rate  if it proves stable. V. In themselves  however  the future larger economic area and credible compliance with the convergence criteria will not guarantee that the euro actually  and above all globally  develops into a serious alternative to the dollar. Ultimately  the real economic environment in Europe must likewise be right. The former Chairman of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bank  Alfred Herrhausen  once said: “A currency becomes good if its underlying economy is also good”. At present the European continent is being handicapped  above all  by the high degree of official regulation and the manifold inflexibilities on the labour market. In Germany  in particular  a confusing tax system with a high tax ratio is crippling economic dynamism. With respect to competitiveness  if Europe’s economy loses touch with other regions in the long run  this is bound to have adverse effects on the euro as well. At all events  the euro will not in itself solve the structural problems besetting Europe. Worldwide locational competition calls for flexibility and the willingness to undertake structural reforms. Nowadays these characteristics are distinctly more marked in the United States than in most European countries. But there are some examples  on the old continent as well  which warrant hope. BIS Review 101/1997 VI. - 4 - In some quarters  the planned European monetary union is being viewed with concern through American eyes. That is understandable  for a soft euro -- let alone a failure of the monetary union -- is in the interest neither of Europe nor of the United States. But there are a number of reasons for hoping for a stable euro that can play a leading role in the international monetary system: In Europe international investors find sophisticated financial markets encompassing a broad range of products and maturities. Structural changes in the international financial markets over the last fifteen years have worked to the detriment of the dollar. They have resulted in a rising market share of European currencies. • Given roughly equal economic potential  the European Union is more closely integrated in the international division of labour than the United States. That suggests that the demand for euros as a transaction currency will be strong. • The European Central Bank will be independent of political instructions. It is committed solely to the priority of internal monetary stability. • The potential for excessive budget deficits is strictly limited by the Treaty of Maastricht and the Stability and Growth Pact. • The Maastricht Treaty has noticeably fostered stability-consciousness in Europe. Inflation performance here is better than ever before. Only countries which can show evidence of long-standing stability are supposed to participate in monetary union. • The euro can take up the torch from some illustrious currencies. That applies particularly to the Deutsche Mark -- today the world’s second biggest reserve currency  after the dollar. Of course  ultimately the development of the euro will hinge on whether it proves lastingly stable and to that extent can assume the legacy of those currencies which are already stable today. But all those involved are quite convinced: the euro has to be a success. Despite all the headway made up to now  however  a great deal remains to be done. In the forefront are the sustained consolidation of public finance and the dismantling of structural rigidities. I am sure these needs are increasingly being recognised. Anyway  there is certainly a good prospect of the euro duly playing its role of being an international investment  reserve and transaction currency alongside the dollar. That is  after all  in the best interests of Europe  the United States and third countries alike. BIS Review 101/1997

Tietmeyer explique la politique de stabilité dans la future UEM (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  27 Oct 97),Exposé de Prof. Dr. Hans Tietmeyer  Président de la Deutsche Bundesbank  au Club de l'Expansion  à Paris  le 27/10/97.,M. Tietmeyer explique la politique de stabilité dans la future UEM Exposé de Prof. Dr. Hans Tietmeyer  Président de la Deutsche Bundesbank  au Club de l’Expansion  à Paris  le 27/10/97. I A la veille d’entrer dans un nouveau millénaire  nombreux sont ceux qui en Europe attendent avec une certaine fébrilité une “nouvelle ère monétaire” qui doit commencer début 1999 déjà avec la monnaie européenne commune. Pendant longtemps  l’UEM n’a représenté qu’une vision générale. Après avoir été inscrite pour la première fois -- officiellement -- dans le calendrier européen au sommet de La Haye en 1969  puis avoir été concrétisée par le plan Werner  l’Union monétaire a disparu de la scène politique durant les deux décennies suivantes. Avec la signature du traité de Maastricht en 1992  l’UEM est toutefois devenue un objectif obligé s’inscrivant dans un plan fixé par contrat et comportant des échéances précises. Or  ce plan doit être réalisé de façon à ce que l’on puisse ériger une construction durablement stable qui ne soit pas un échafaudage fragile donnant lieu à des conflits. En effet  l’UEM ne pourra faire progresser l’intégration économique et politique et éviter les conflits que si elle repose sur des fondations vraiment stables et si les lois économiques sont continuellement observées. Voilà en quoi consiste notre objectif commun. L’Union monétaire est le couronnement d’un long processus historique. La France et l’Allemagne en ont été dès le début les forces motrices. Depuis la fin de la deuxième guerre mondiale  ces deux pays se sont fixé comme objectif la coopération économique et politique et ont cherché à établir des bases solides permettant de garantir la prospérité et la paix en Europe. Ils ont été le moteur de l’intégration  même si par moments leurs motivations et positions étaient différentes. Mais c’est surtout dans le domaine de la politique monétaire que s’est produit  durant la dernière décennie  un rapprochement fondamental. II En conformité avec la mission qui leur est assignée  les banques centrales de nos deux pays ont  aujourd’hui  comme objectif prioritaire la stabilité monétaire. Actuellement  le taux d’augmentation annuel des prix à la consommation en France et en Allemagne oscille entre un peu moins de 1½% et 2%. Les taux directeurs  de 3 3% dans les deux pays  sont pour le moment au même niveau. Sur le compartiment du long terme  c’est-à-dire sur les marchés des capitaux où se négocient par exemple les emprunts d’Etat à long terme  les taux sont également plus ou moins identiques. Mais ce qui est encore bien plus important dans ce contexte  c’est qu’il y ait conformité entre les positions des deux pays sur le plan de la politique monétaire. Ainsi  les responsables de la Banque de France et de la Bundesbank sont convaincues que la stabilité des prix est la condition essentielle pour assurer la croissance  un bon niveau d’emploi et la stabilité monétaire externe. Mais elles savent aussi que la stabilité des prix ne suffit pas  elle seule  à la longue. Elle doit s’accompagner également d’une réorientation des politiques financière  fiscale  sociale et salariale  qui doit stimuler le dynamisme économique et  partant  encourager l’emploi. La stratégie à long terme de nos deux instituts  qui diverge fondamentalement de la politique de réglage en finesse du processus économique pratiquée autrefois dans les pays anglo-saxons  devrait également être adoptée  à mon avis  par la future banque centrale européenne. Le fait que les politiques menées par la Banque de France et la Deutsche Bundesbank soient semblables  en théorie comme en pratique  n’est pas dû au seul BIS Review 102/1997 - 2 - hasard. C’est l’aboutissement d’un processus de rapprochement lancé depuis assez longtemps déjà. Le facteur décisif a certainement été le fait qu’au printemps 1983 la France a opté pour une politique économique et financière axée sur la stabilité et qu’elle n’a pas dévié de cette voie durant les années suivantes  malgré toutes les difficultés qu’elle a rencontrées. Le résultat est que les taux de change se sont stabilisés dans une mesure croissante au sein du SME  tout comme le niveau des prix en Europe. Avec le traité de Maastricht qui prévoit que les banques centrales nationales n’ont aucune instruction à recevoir des gouvernements  la France et l’Allemagne ont délibérément recherché aussi la convergence au niveau institutionnel et  à présent  elles ont largement réalisé cet objectif. III Etant donné que les dangers menaçant la stabilité se sont accrus et que la politique monétaire exerce  depuis une assez longue période  des effets de plus en plus expansifs même si les taux directeurs n’ont pas bougé  la Bundesbank a légèrement resserré les rênes monétaires début octobre. Plusieurs autres banques centrales européennes -- dont la Banque de France -- ont elles aussi relevé quelque peu leurs taux. Dans nos deux pays  la loi stipule aujourd’hui que les décisions de politique monétaire sont du seul ressort des banques centrales et ne peuvent en aucun cas être influencées par le gouvernement et la politique. Cette règle est également conforme au traité de Maastricht. Et l’indépendance de la future banque centrale européenne a encore une fois été réaffirmée lors de la réunion informelle de l’Ecofin à Mondorf-les-Bains et à l’occasion du Conseil économique et financier franco-allemand de Münster. Cela implique également que la responsabilité sera désormais assumée  au niveau européen  seulement à travers le rapport présenté par le président de la Banque centrale européenne et non pas par les divers membres du future Système européen de banques centrales. Le relèvement de 0 3 point de pourcentage du troisième taux directeur vise à contrecarrer d’éventuelles pressions inflationnistes. Ainsi  la politique monétaire contribue à ce que les taux à long terme du marché -- qui sont d’une grande importance pour l’économie en Allemagne tout comme en France -- continuent à se situer à un niveau aussi bas que possible. Si  depuis  les taux d’intérêt à long terme ont subi une légère hausse dans nos deux pays  c’est parce que l’évolution observée sur les marchés américains a gagné notre continent. De nombreux analystes des milieux bancaires sont d’avis que le relèvement des taux directeurs favorise aussi la convergence des taux à court terme en Europe. J’estime qu’il faut faire preuve  là  de circonspection. Il est certain que les taux à court terme des pays de l’Union se rapprocheront progressivement les uns des autres à partir du printemps 1998  une fois que les taux de conversion bilatéraux auront été fixés. J’espère qu’ils le feront au niveau le plus bas possible et non pas au niveau qui constituera la moyenne des taux directeurs pratiqués jusque-là en Europe. Mais ce niveau dépendra bien entendu de la situation économique du moment ainsi que du choix des pays qui participeront à l’UEM  qui restent pour l’heure deux inconnues. IV Actuellement  presque tous les pays de l’Union européenne sont confrontés à un chômage record. Mais ce n’est pas en pratiquant une politique monétaire laxiste qu’ils pourront résoudre ce problème puisque le sous-emploi a essentiellement une origine structurelle  tout au BIS Review 102/1997 - 3 - moins en Allemagne. Jean-Claude Trichet a indiqué récemment que les banques centrales ne pouvaient -- et ne devaient -- fournir à l’économie que le meilleur environnement monétaire possible. Mais elles ne peuvent pas “prescrire” croissance et emploi. C’est aux partenaires sociaux de faire le nécessaire -- par le biais d’une plus grande flexibilité et mobilité -- pour qu’il n’y ait pas de suppressions de postes et que de nouveaux emplois soient créés. Il est certain que la politique économique  financière et sociale de l’Etat doit également renforcer la dynamique de l’économie en créant des conditions propices et en contribuant  surtout dans nos deux pays  à réduire le chômage. Récemment  le FMI a exhorté  à juste titre  les Européens à tout faire pour que l’euro puisse bien démarrer. Il a rappelé l’urgence de réformer les marchés du travail et les systèmes d’assurance sociale et de retraite. Car  de lui-même  l’euro ne pourra pas résoudre ces problèmes. La politique de stabilité n’est pas au demeurant une invention allemande. Il faudrait à ce propos éliminer les préjugés qui existent encore dans nos deux pays. En France aussi  il s’est toujours trouvé quelqu’un pour réclamer une économie stable non inflationniste. Rappelez-vous ce qu’a écrit Jacques Rueff à la fin des années cinquante sur l’âge de l’inflation. Pour Rueff  les revendications excessives adressées à l’Etat mettent en péril la stabilité des prix et le système économique et social libéral. L’histoire est riche en exemples montrant comment  à la longue  des comptes publics non ordonnés peuvent ébranler la monnaie et l’économie. En France surtout  l’assainissement des budgets publics a toujours revêtu une grande importance. C’est ainsi que jusqu’au début des années quatre-vingt  le déficit budgétaire a été bien inférieur à la limite de 3% fixée par le traité de Maastricht. L’endettement est resté jusqu’à maintenant au-dessous du seuil de 60 % imposé par les critères de convergence. La limite de 3% n’a d’ailleurs pas été inscrite dans le traité de Maastricht à la demande des Allemands  mais sur l’initiative des Français. Il faudra aussi impérativement que les finances publiques soient durablement stables lorsque l’Union monétaire européenne (et sa politique monétaire unique) aura été mise en place. En effet  des dettes publiques élevées -- en particulier lorsqu’elles sont financées à court terme -- peuvent sérieusement compliquer la mise en application de la politique monétaire unique et être source de conflits. V Avant de conclure  j’aimerais encore parler brièvement du développement de l’intégration politique dans l’Union  domaine qui à vrai dire n’entre pas tout à fait dans les attributions d’un banquier central. Me référant à une phrase de Voltaire qui a dit que “les paroles sont aux pensées ce que l’or est aux diamants; il est nécessaire pour les mettre en œuvre  mais il en faut peu”  je résumerai ma pensée. La question de l’intégration monétaire à trouvé une réponse dans le traité de Maastricht. Cependant  en dépit des efforts déployés avant et pendant le conseil d’Amsterdam  aucune solution n’a été trouvée pour une grande partie des interrogations suscitées par la question de la finalité politique de l’intégration européenne. Je suppose que pour certains points très importants comme l’organisation institutionnelle ou la définition exacte des compétences nationales ou supranationales dans les differénts domaines politiques  ces questions ne pourront pas être résolues dans l’immédiat. Mais toutes les nations concernées doivent être conscientes de ce que l’Union monétaire sera  dès le départ  une communauté monétaire solidaire qui ne pourra plus être résiliée. Non seulement il n’y aura plus de taux directeurs différents dans l’Union monétaire  mais une importante partie de la politique cessera de relever de la compétance des pays pour être exercée à l’échelon supranational  et ce de façon définitive. Il ne sera en effet plus possible de sortir de l’Union BIS Review 102/1997 - 4 - monétaire. C’est pourquoi il faut qu’il y ait aussi une volonté politique de s’engager durablement en formant une union politique. Cela vaut en particulier à la veille de l’élargissement de l’Union européenne. Valéry Giscard d’Estaing et Helmut Schmidt ont rappelé  à juste titre  dans un article commun publié il y a quelques jours  que “le succès de la monnaie unique dépend  à terme  de l’accomplissement de nouveaux pas sur le plan politique. Sans cela  les changements de gouvernement intervenant dans l’un ou l’autre des pays membres risqueraient de remettre en cause la solidité de l’Union. (...) On aurait pu s’attendre à ce que le traité d’Amsterdam contienne des décisions prises par les pays participants  mais ceux-ci n’étaient pas capables de s’accorder sur des réformes. (...) L’Union monétaire est un projet fédéral qui doit être accompagné et soutenu par d’autres mesures. Elle n’a jamais été faite pour rester un îlot isolé dans l’œil d’un cyclone d’intérêts nationaux.” Pour toutes ces raisons  il est nécessaire que la coopération franco-allemande devienne encore plus intense  afin que le dynamisme de l’intégration ne faiblisse pas après l’entrée dans l’Union monétaire. L’unification européenne est et reste un objectif porteur. BIS Review 102/1997
r971107d,1997-11-07,https://www.bis.org/review/r971107d.pdf,Mr. Meyer considers the approach of the Euro (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  4 Nov 97),Address given by the Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank  Dr. Hans Meyer  to the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce in Zurich on 4/11/97.,Bank of Japan’s summary of the annual review of monetary and economic developments in fiscal 1996 BANK OF JAPAN  ANNUAL REVIEW 1997. Overview Japan’s economy followed a moderate recovery trend in fiscal 1996. The pace of recovery began to accelerate at the end of 1995  aided by substantially stimulative monetary and fiscal policy measures  and the recovery continued in fiscal 1996. In the second half of the fiscal year  the economic recovery firmed  particularly in private demand  driven in part by the depreciation of the yen since the previous year. With respect to final demand in the first half of fiscal 1996  net exports declined sharply  reflecting such factors as the appreciation of the yen until the middle of 1995 and the increase in imports of manufactured goods from Japanese affiliates overseas. However  the economic recovery was underpinned by policy-related demand factors  such as the increase in public-sector investment reflecting the economic stimulus package of autumn 1995  and the high level of housing investment induced by low interest rates. In the middle of fiscal 1996  public-sector investment began to decline gradually from its peak  while net exports  which had been restraining the economic recovery  started to rise  partly reflecting the depreciation of the yen. Regarding private demand  business fixed investment increased steadily throughout the fiscal year  reflecting recovery in corporate profits  progress in stock adjustments  and a rise in autonomous investment  such as in information technology  and the increase spread across industries from large manufacturing firms to small nonmanufacturing firms. Personal consumption followed a moderate recovery trend in line with a recovery in compensation of employees despite fluctuations caused by factors such as the weather. From autumn 1996  automobile sales  which have a large influence on production  accelerated. Housing investment remained high  owing both to the increase in demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate  implemented in April 1997  and to low interest rates. Industrial production remained virtually unchanged until the middle of 1996  reflecting the decrease in net exports  and adjustments in the excessive inventories of some producer goods. However  growth in production has gradually gathered pace since the middle of the year  as private demand has increased steadily  net exports have begun to increase  and the increase in final demand has led more directly to a rise in production because of progress in inventory adjustments. At the end of the fiscal year  both industrial production and shipments recovered to the levels recorded at the previous peak in the economic cycle reflecting the increase in demand before the rise in the consumption tax rate. In these circumstances  corporate profits continued to recover primarily among large manufacturing firms  driven in part by a rise in profits of processing industries reflecting the depreciation of the yen and the success of corporate restructuring efforts. Business confidence also improved gradually  according to the Bank of Japan’s “Tankan—Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan.” The improvement in profits of large manufacturing firms was reflected in an increase in their expenditures  which in turn contributed to a recovery in the business conditions of corporate service industries and small manufacturing firms. As for labor market conditions  the unemployment rate remained high and growth in the number of the regularly employed stagnated owing to persistent adjustment pressures on personnel expenses in the corporate sector. However  overtime working hours and the number of new job offers increased steadily  reflecting production growth and improvements in corporate profits  and compensation of employees rose gradually  particularly in special cash earnings. In sum  the overall labor market conditions followed a recovery trend. BIS Review 78/1997 - 2 - While substantially stimulative monetary and fiscal policy measures in fiscal 1995 continued to underpin economic recovery in early fiscal 1996  a positive cycle of demand  production  and income began to operate  underpinning the economic recovery throughout fiscal 1996. That is  an increase in final demand pushed up production and led to an improvement in corporate profits  particularly among large manufacturing firms. This in turn led to an improvement in profits and a rise in compensation of employees among nonmanufacturing firms and small firms  thereby expanding expenditures. During the second half of fiscal 1996  the recovery in private demand firmed  reflecting the positive effects of the depreciation of the yen on corporate profits  despite a decrease in public-sector investment. In other words  although the pace of the economic recovery remained moderate  a recovery led by policy demand is gradually shifting toward one led by private demand. Although Japan’s economy bottomed out at the end of 1993  the pace of recovery remains relatively moderate  owing to various structural adjustment pressures on industries. These include (1) pressures for the industrial structure to change in response to global competition resulting from the expansion of supply capacity in Asian countries  and to the constant appreciation of the yen until the middle of 1995; and (2) balance-sheet adjustment pressures owing to the sharp and significant decline in asset prices since the bursting of the economic “bubble” in the late 1980s. Steady progress has been made in dealing with the pressures for the industrial structure to change  as reflected in (1) a significant improvement in corporate profits  particularly among large manufacturing firms  resulting from the successful restructuring efforts and the depreciation of the yen from the middle of 1995; (2) progress in the reorganization of the international production system as seen in the shift in Japan’s exports and production toward more capital- and technology-intensive goods; and (3) increased business fixed investment in new sectors owing to technological innovations and deregulation in information and communications industries. With regard to balance-sheet adjustments  strong adjustment pressures remained throughout fiscal 1996  as seen in the persistently high level of the ratio of debts to assets  especially among small nonmanufacturing firms. In fiscal 1996  weakening of prices came to a halt. Domestic wholesale prices followed a downward trend until the middle of 1996  but in the second half of fiscal 1996 they virtually stopped declining  owing to a moderate improvement in domestic supply and demand conditions  as well as a rise in import prices reflecting the depreciation of the yen and the rise in crude oil prices. In March 1997  the year-to-year change shifted from decline to increase. Although corporate service prices continued to decline compared to the level of the previous year  reflecting the decrease in leasing prices and real estate rents  the year-to-year declines were smaller in the second half of fiscal 1996  due to a recovery in demand for services following the improvement in corporate profits. Consumer prices (nationwide  excluding perishables) also increased by a slightly wider margin from the previous year owing to a smaller decline in commodity prices as a result of the depreciation of the yen  and the halt in the decline in domestic wholesale prices  as well as a gradual increase in service prices. While prices seemed to have stopped declining  the increase in import prices from the depreciation of the yen and higher crude oil prices had little impact on domestic prices  as there remained persistent downward pressures on prices from imports of manufactured goods  particularly final goods  and technological innovations. As for commercial land  prices for large and well-located plots of land suitable for development virtually stopped declining owing mainly to the gradual progress in stock adjustment for office space. However  the prices of smaller plots of land with limited commercial value continued to decline. The recent development in commercial land prices thus indicates a distinct splitting into two groups. Meanwhile  residential land prices are bottoming out  reflecting the high level of residential housing construction. BIS Review 78/1997 - 3 - The cyclical momentum for economic recovery gathered strength in fiscal 1996. However  the pace of the recovery remained moderate owing to continued structural adjustment pressures  including the balance-sheet problems. Although weakening of prices had come to a halt by the second half of fiscal 1996  prices were unlikely to follow an upward trend. Against the background of these economic and price conditions  the Bank of Japan maintained an easy monetary policy  keeping the official discount rate at its September 1995 level of 0.5 percent to establish a solid foundation for the economic recovery. As for financial developments  the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) remained on average slightly below the official discount rate following monetary adjustments by the Bank of Japan. Long-term interest rates continued to rise with some fluctuations in the first half of 1996  but fell sharply in the second half. Interest rates on short-term instruments  namely 3-month certificate of deposit (CD) rates  followed a similar trend  although with smaller fluctuations than those in long-term interest rates. Stock prices continued to rise during the first half of 1996  but began to weaken in the summer  and fell sharply from the end of the year. The year-to-year growth rate of M2+CDs  a representative indicator of monetary aggregates  generally remained around 3.0-4.0 percent  but declined slightly in the second half of the fiscal year  partly due to the slow growth in funding in the private sector. Despite the firm recovery of the real economy  particularly in the private sector during the second half of fiscal 1996  the financial markets during this period adopted a more cautious stance. This was because (1) the financial markets reacted in anticipation of the fiscal tightening measures—such as the rise in the consumption tax rate and the termination of special tax reductions in fiscal 1997—and this had restraining effects on economic conditions; and (2) there was renewed awareness that various adjustment pressures  especially balance-sheet adjustment pressures  remained strong among small nonmanufacturing firms and financial institutions. Under these circumstances  the cyclical developments of the economic recovery were not immediately reflected in financial indicators through the confidence of market participants. Meanwhile  significant progress was made in fiscal 1996 in the solution of the jusen (housing loan companies) problem  and steady progress was also made in solving the problem of nonperforming assets of financial institutions  including improvements in the framework for the resolution of failed financial institutions. With respect to the outlook  the probability that Japan’s economy will continue to recover is rising  although the pace of recovery may decelerate temporarily. This expectation is based on the fact that the positive cycle of production and consumption has not been deterred by the reaction to the increase in demand ahead of the consumption tax rate rise. Despite the continued economic recovery  the private sector has not gained sufficient confidence in its future growth  reflecting persistent uncertainty about structural adjustments. Under the structural adjustment pressures  expected growth rates are unlikely to rise at the same pace in different industries and firms. However  from a long-term perspective  the establishment of a new industrial structure based on the principle of comparative advantage can be expected to enhance growth by promoting the efficiency of resource allocation. In order for Japan’s economy to achieve sustainable growth  it is vital to create investment opportunities and raise expected growth rates of economic entities through effective reforms of the economic structure. Such efforts are essential in adapting to the medium- to long-term changes in economic environment  including increasing global competitive pressures  and the further aging of the population  and in maintaining Japan’s economic strength. Considering the important role that the financial sector must play in the reforms of the economic structure  it will be necessary to continue implementing measures to stabilize the BIS Review 78/1997 - 4 - Japanese financial system  and increase domestic and overseas confidence in the system. At the same time  the financial system must be reorganized to enhance its functions and competitiveness  by improving the infrastructure in order to promote competition in accordance with the Japanese “Big Bang” deregulation package.

Introduction Les échéances fixées par le Traité de Maastricht se rapprochent à grands pas. Au printemps prochain seront désignés les pays qui participeront à la première phase d’intégration monétaire. Tout porte à penser  sur la base des indicateurs de convergence observables actuellement  que l’Union monétaire sera plus large que ce que l’on imaginait il y a douze mois seulement. Dans moins d’un an  donc  il se pourrait que tous les pays entourant la Suisse aient uni leur destin monétaire. Que devons-nous attendre  en Suisse  de ce profond changement d’horizon monétaire? Quelles en seront les conséquences pour le franc suisse et pour la politique de la Banque nationale suisse? Je suis heureux de pouvoir développer ces thèmes devant vous et de m’exprimer sur sol terre si proche  géographiquement et économiquement  de la Suisse et si proche aussi de notre coeur. lombard  une italien et 2. Un changement profond d’environnement 2.1. .... en Europe Si  d’un point de vue suisse  l’Union monétaire entraînera un profond bouleversement de l’environnement européen  le choc sera encore plus marqué pour les membres de l’Union eux-mêmes. Avec la monnaie unique  les marchés européens franchiront un nouveau et très important pas dans leur intégration. Non seulement les biens  les capitaux et les personnes circuleront librement  mais il n’y aura plus qu’une seule monnaie -- l’euro -- donc une seule politique monétaire et une seule structure des taux d’intérêt. L’apparition d’un taux d’intérêt unique et d’un marché financier intégré marquera fortement l’économie européenne du 21ème siècle. Songez que  il y a cinq ans seulement  l’écart entre les taux à long terme en Allemagne et en Italie était de 660 points de base. Aujourd’hui  à la veille de l’Union  ce différentiel est tombé à 80 points  demain  il aura disparu. La convergence des taux d’intérêt à long terme a été le signe le plus concret des progrès vers l’Union monétaire. L’exemple le plus frappant est celui de la parfaite coïncidence qui existe maintenant entre les taux français et allemands  la France et l’Allemagne étant les deux pays sans lesquels l’Union ne pourra se faire. Une bonne part de la convergence financière observée ces derniers mois tient à l’anticipation de progrès substantiels dans la correction des déficits publics et le respect de la norme des 3 %. Les récentes estimations effectuées à ce sujet par la Commission de Bruxelles l’ont encore renforcée. Mais il ne faut pas oublier non plus que la décrue spectaculaire des taux d’inflation dans les pays du sud de l’Europe a grandement aidé à rapprocher les situations des marchés financiers. Personne ne peut dire à quel niveau se situeraient aujourd’hui les taux d’intérêt dans les différents pays européens s’ils n’étaient pas engagés dans le processus d’intégration monétaire. Aujourd’hui déjà  certains d’entre eux bénéficient certainement d’un effet BIS Review 103/1997 - 2 - d’entraînement favorable  d’autres doivent compter peut-être avec une prime nouvelle d’insécurité. A mes yeux  l’économie italienne profite déjà et profitera encore plus demain de son ancrage plus ferme dans l’édifice européen. Son dynamisme pourra s’appuyer sur des conditions de financement bien plus favorables que par le passé. La seconde révolution entraînée par la monnaie unique sera celle de l’unification des marchés financiers européens. Avec la disparition des monnaies nationales  les banques se trouveront en situation de plus grande concurrence  leurs clients étant en mesure de comparer rapidement la qualité des produits offerts. Les grandes manoeuvres ont déjà commencé dans le secteur bancaire depuis l’introduction de la liberté des mouvements de capitaux; elles vont se poursuivre et même s’intensifier. Sous la pression de la monnaie unique  mais aussi sous celle de la globalisation des marchés et des progrès technologiques  l’industrie bancaire européenne va devoir procéder à un assainissement de ses structures. Notre continent est clairement „over-banked“; peu de chose s’opposera encore aux ajustements structurels lorsque la monnaie unique sera en place. 2.2. .... et en Suisse 2.2.1. Un environnement plus homogène Avec l’apparition de l’euro  l’Europe passera donc d’un espace à devises multiples  à marchés financiers fragmentés  à une zone uniforme aux dimensions de celles des Etats-Unis. Si les Européens gagnent leur pari de mettre en place une monnaie saine  la Suisse bénéficiera alors d’un environnement beaucoup plus homogène et stable que par le passé. Nous avons derrière nous l’expérience de plus de vingt ans de franc suisse flottant. Cette expérience s’est révélée positive sur de nombreux plans  notamment sur celui de la maîtrise de l’inflation et des taux d’intérêt bas dont nous jouissons. Mais les changes flottants -- ou plus concrètement l’absence d’ordre monétaire international -- comportent aussi des inconvénients pour les petits pays. Le plus grave est celui de l’absence de discipline imposée aux politiques économiques nationales. Avec la monnaie unique et l’application d’une seule politique monétaire  notre environnement gagnera en homogénéité et des sources de perturbation disparaîtront. Evidemment  cette situation pourra attrister quelques salles de change  mais c’est sans aucun doute un point positif pour l’économie suisse dans son ensemble. Pour illustrer ce point  permettez-moi de prendre deux exemples: Considérez tout d’abord la relation entre le franc suisse et le mark allemand au cours des quinze dernières années. Si les choses sont mesurées en terme réel  on constate que la relation franc -- DM a oscillé dans une bande de fluctuation relativement étroite  de – 5 %  autour d’un trend d’appréciation du franc de l’ordre de 0 5 % par an. Vue sous cet angle  la relation entre le franc et le mark  deux monnaies qui n’étaient liées par aucun accord monétaire et dont les cours n’étaient pas influencés par des interventions sur les marchés des changes  s’est révélée être extraordinairement stable. Les changes flottants n’ont donc pas généré les cours irrationnels que certains annonçaient. BIS Review 103/1997 - 3 - Pourquoi cette stabilité relative entre le franc et le mark? Parce qu’il existait entre la Suisse et l’Allemagne une grande convergence des objectifs de politique économique et des situations conjoncturelles. Considérez maintenant la relation entre le franc suisse et la lire italienne  pour la même période et sur les mêmes bases. L’image que l’on en retire est fort différente. La volatilité est beaucoup plus forte. La lire connaît une longue période d’appréciation jusqu’en 1992  puis chute dans un retournement dramatique de situation  suivi d’une nouvelle normalisation. Vous connaissez les raisons qui se trouvent en arrière-plan de ces fluctuations de la lire. Elles tiennent aux situations souvent difficiles rencontrées par la politique économique italienne durant ces années. Pour l’économie suisse  de telles variations de cours sont extrêmement douloureuses. Le degré de compétitivité de son industrie d’exportation se modifie dramatiquement  et ceci dans des périodes relativement brèves. Il s’ensuivit des coûts élevés d’ajustement au plan économique et social. La relation entre le franc et le mark et celle entre le franc et la lire révèlent donc deux aspects bien différents de notre histoire financière récente. D’un côté  une relative stabilité  de l’autre  une volatilité marquée. C’est dans ce domaine qu’un progrès considérable sera réalisé grâce à l’intégration monétaire européenne. Avec la fixation irrémédiable des parités  puis l’introduction de l’euro  une seule politique monétaire sera appliquée. Le continent aura gagné en homogénéité financière. Si l’euro disposait  demain  des mêmes caractéristiques que le mark allemand  la relation entre le franc suisse et les monnaies européennes sera beaucoup plus stable que par le passé. Les progrès de la stabilité monétaire profiteront donc non seulement aux Européens mais aussi à ceux qui vivent à leur côté. 2.2.2. Une intégration accélérée Au-delà du changement de l’environnement financier  je m’attends aussi à ce que la monnaie unique accélère l’intégration de fait de l’économie suisse dans l’économie européenne. Aujourd’hui déjà  80 % de nos importations proviennent de l’Union européenne  qui absorbe à son tour 60 % de nos exportations. De par nos flux commerciaux  notre conjoncture dépend fortement de ce qui se passe chez nos voisins. Les retournements conjoncturels en Suisse coïncident avec ceux de la France et de l’Allemagne. Demain  avec une politique macro-économique unifiée autour de nous  tout porte à croire que les pulsions économiques qui s’exerceront sur nous seront de plus en plus synchronisées. Notre rythme de production deviendra ainsi encore plus dépendant de ce qui se passe sur le continent. Parallèlement à l’homogénéité économique croissante de l’Union européenne on constatera que la Suisse aura de plus en plus un profil européen. Cette intégration accrue de la Suisse dans l’Europe nous demandera évidemment de vivre étroitement avec la future monnaie européenne. Tous les secteurs de notre économie qui commercent avec l’étranger se trouveront concernés. En premier lieu  le marché européen va devenir effectivement un „grand marché“ dans lequel une monnaie -- l’euro -- sera l’instrument de transaction. Nous devons en tenir compte. Les pratiques européennes en matière de contrats  de conditions  de normes s’imposeront encore plus à nous que par le passé. Il sera toujours plus difficile d’utiliser le franc BIS Review 103/1997 - 4 - comme monnaie de facturation pour nos exportations et les touristes qui passeront la frontière comprendront mal qu’ils ne puissent utiliser leurs euros pour effectuer leurs paiements. La réalité d’une grande zone monétaire à notre porte nous demandera de la souplesse et de l’imagination. L’Europe  qui jusqu’ici n’était qu’une mosaïque monétaire  deviendra un ensemble monolithique. Ceci ne peut rester sans conséquence sur notre manière de commercer. Un autre aspect important de l’impact de l’euro sur l’économie suisse est celui de la mise en place d’un système de paiement interbancaire en euros. Cette question est délicate car elle n’est pas encore résolue au sein de l’Union européenne elle-même. De quoi s’agit-il? Au sein de l’Union monétaire  les systèmes nationaux de paiements interbancaires seront reliés entre eux. Il sera aussi possible de faire un paiement  valeur du jour même  de Paris à Francfort alors qu’aujourd’hui une telle opération s’exécute en 48 heures. Le système européen des paiements ainsi créé bénéficiera de l’appui de la Banque centrale européenne s’il devait être en manque de liquidités. Au niveau européen existera donc ce qui existe déjà au niveau national. La difficulté vient du fait qu’un certain nombre de pays de l’UE ne participeront pas à la première phase d’intégration monétaire. Pourront-ils se connecter au système des paiements  et à quelles conditions? Cette question n’est pas encore réglée au sein de l’Union. Dans ces conditions  la récente décision des banques suisses de créer en Allemagne une banque de clearing qui sera chargée d’exécuter leurs paiements mutuels en euros et d’établir un pont avec la Banque centrale européenne me paraît adéquate. Il conviendra d’examiner si la Banque nationale peut jouer un rôle utile dans ce cadre lorsque les conditions de coopération entre les „ins“ et les „outs“ au sein de l’Union européenne auront été arrêtées. 3. Les conséquences pour la Banque nationale J’en viens ainsi tout naturellement à la troisième partie de cet exposé: les conséquences de l’intégration monétaire pour la politique de la Banque nationale. A mon sens  deux types de questions se posent: les implications à long terme de l’intégration monétaire sur la politique de la BNS  les influences de court terme. A long terme  l’Union monétaire européenne est pour nous synonyme d’imbrication accrue de l’économie suisse dans la scène monétaire européenne. La situation du marché des changes  qui est déjà aujourd’hui un facteur important dans notre appréciation de la situation  le sera plus encore. Le fait qu’une grande partie de notre commerce s’effectuera avec la zone euro  le fait aussi que la conjoncture européenne s’imposera toujours plus à la nôtre créeront forcément une communauté de destin entre le franc et l’euro. Une trop grande volatilité de l’euro par rapport au franc pourrait devenir extrêmement douloureuse pour l’économie suisse. Nous en sommes conscients. J’ai toutefois confiance  et je base ma confiance sur l’expérience de la cohabitation du franc suisse et du mark au cours des quinze dernières années. Si les objectifs et les situations économiques convergent entre la Suisse et l’Union européenne  tout porte à penser que la volatilité de la relation franc -- euro se maintiendra dans des limites acceptables. Cette BIS Review 103/1997 - 5 - convergence des options fondamentales me paraît acquise puisque la Banque centrale européenne  tout comme la BNS  fera de la stabilité des prix l’objectif prioritaire de sa politique. Au fil des années  le franc et l’euro reposeront donc sur des éléments fondamentaux fort semblables. Cela aura également pour conséquence de permettre un rapprochement progressif des taux d’intérêt sur ces devises. Aujourd’hui  l’écart entre les taux suisses et allemands (représentant les taux sur l’euro) est de plus de 200 points de base. Cet écart me semble biaisé par les incertitudes liées à l’introduction de la monnaie unique. Une fois celles-ci dissipées  un rapprochement devrait se manifester. Ce ne seront pas seulement les taux suisses qui monteront mais aussi les taux sur l’euro qui baisseront. Ce rapprochement n’est pas pour demain  il se manifestera lorsque les marchés seront convaincus de la stabilité de la nouvelle monnaie européenne. Dans le court terme  la phase d’introduction de l’euro est marquée par une forte incertitude. Pourtant  tout a été mis en place au niveau institutionnel comme au niveau des critères de convergence pour convaincre les marchés que l’euro sera une monnaie de qualité. Mais tant que les marchés ne pourront pas juger sur pièce  une incertitude existera  incertitude qui pourrait être source d’instabilité des marchés et qui pourrait maintenir les taux d’intérêt à un niveau plus élevé que ce qui serait souhaitable d’un point de vue conjoncturel. Cette volatilité potentielle de l’euro pourrait créer des difficultés pour le franc suisse  monnaie de refuge. Comment neutraliser de telles perturbations pour l’économie suisse? Il n’y a pas de réponse simple et évidente à cette question. Certains pensent qu’il conviendrait  à l’image de ce qu’avait fait l’Autriche  que la Suisse décide de se lier unilatéralement à l’euro afin d’éliminer le risque de change. Il lui suffirait pour cela de mener une politique de taux d’intérêt appropriée  voire de la renforcer par des interventions sur le marché des changes. Ce n’est malheureusement pas si facile! Si nous fixions une parité entre le franc et l’euro  nous courrions deux risques majeurs: - soit les marchés nous croiraient et nous provoquerions alors une sortie massive de capitaux qui quitteraient le franc pour se placer dans la zone euro où les rémunérations sont nettement plus élevées; soit les marchés ne considéreraient pas cette parité comme définitive et spéculeraient à sa - révision à la hausse. Notre stratégie stimulerait alors la spéculation au lieu de la calmer. Nous devrons donc vivre avec un franc flottant  mais nous devrons aussi nous comporter de telle sorte que „la bataille de l’euro n’ait pas lieu“. Dans ce domaine  comme dans bien d’autres  il vaut mieux prévenir une situation que la corriger. Nous nous sommes efforcés ces douze derniers mois d’éviter une appréciation du franc suisse face au mark. Nous l’avons fait en menant une politique monétaire accommodante. Cette stratégie a été  je crois  couronnée de succès. La faiblesse du mark engendrée par les incertitudes l’euro s’est reportée avant tout sur le dollar et la livre sterling  le franc suisse n’a été atteint que marginalement. Nous devons continuer sur cette ligne tant que les doutes sur l’euro n’auront pas disparu. Mettons-nous ainsi en danger la stabilité des prix à moyen terme? Je ne le crois pas. La croissance de nos agrégats monétaires se ralentit maintenant et le dépassement de la monnaie centrale -- notre indicateur principal -- par rapport à son trend d’équilibre exagère vraisemblablement le degré d’expansion de notre action. Enfin  n’oublions pas que dans un BIS Review 103/1997 - 6 - environnement marqué par le risque d’un franc fort  la probabilité d’une résurgence marquée de l’inflation est faible. Conclusion Les mois qui nous séparent de la première phase d’interprétation monétaire peuvent encore comporter des surprises. Le calme relatif du marché des changes au cours des douze derniers mois est rassurant  il indique que les risques de perturbation futurs sont limités. Une fois la zone monétaire définie  la convergence des taux d’intérêt s’imposera d’elle-même et l’Union monétaire deviendra réalité. C’est une nouvelle phase de l’histoire européenne qui commencera alors. Pour la Suisse également  bien qu’elle ne participe pas à l’intégration monétaire. Nous aurons à vivre avec un environnement plus homogène  dont les taux d’intérêt seront peut-être relativement élevés dans une phase initiale  tant que la monnaie unique n’aura fait preuve de ses qualités. Sur la durée  en revanche  il apparaîtra toujours plus de manière évidente que le franc suisse et l’euro sont des monnaies comparables  ce qui entraînera une convergence des taux entre la Suisse et l’Europe. Personne ne peut dire  aujourd’hui  à quel rythme ces ajustements s’effectueront. La révolution monétaire  comme toute révolution  comporte de nombreuses incertitudes. Nous en avons déjà vécues  nous en vivrons encore jusqu’à la fin de ce siècle. Cela demandera aux entreprises une grande capacité d’adaptation au nouvel environnement. Je ne parle pas seulement des établissements financiers mais aussi de tous ceux qui commercent avec l’Europe. Mais sur la durée  notre industrie d’exportation pourra compter avec un environnement monétaire plus homogène  moins volatil que par le passé. L’Union monétaire demandera aussi beaucoup de pragmatisme dans la conduite de la politique monétaire. Le „pragmatisme“ est souvent attrayant mais ne nous cachons pas qu’il est synonyme de prise de décision dans des conditions particulièrement difficiles où les points de repère sont moins évidents que d’habitude. Nous avons bon espoir  Mesdames et Messieurs  que le nouvel ordre monétaire européen ne créera pas de handicap majeur pour la Suisse et le franc suisse. Il s’agit au contraire d’une chance pour notre pays  celle de clore le chapitre de vingt-cinq années de désordres monétaires en Europe  pour déboucher sur une période où les politiques seront plus convergentes et stables. Nous en attendons plus de calme dans les changes  ce qui sera dans l’intérêt du développement de notre commerce extérieur et aussi dans celui d’un retour à la croissance économique dans notre pays.

r971112b,1997-11-12,https://www.bis.org/review/r971112b.pdf,Mr. Macfarlane's statement to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  6 Nov 97),Statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia  Mr. Ian Macfarlane  to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration in Sydney on 6/11/97.,Mr. Macfarlane’s statement to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration Statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia  Mr. Ian Macfarlane  to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration in Sydney on 6/11/97. Thank you  Mr Chairman. It is a pleasure to be here in front of your Committee for the second time under the new arrangements set out in the Statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy. On the basis of the first hearing  we think the new arrangements are working very well. On that occasion  we received some very penetrating and constructive questioning from Committee members  and there seemed to be quite a lot of public interest in the proceedings. Of course  we should always be trying to improve our procedures  but the only improvement we have been able to make on this occasion is to get our half-yearly report to the Committee two hours ahead of the hearing  compared with one hour last time. You will appreciate that in order to follow due process we cannot finalise the document until after our Board Meeting which was on Tuesday. I should also say that I was hoping that we might have been able to have this hearing somewhere other than Sydney. While it is very convenient for us to be meeting again in the New South Wales Parliament House about 100 metres from my office  we see merit in this hearing moving to other State capitals and Canberra on a regular basis if that is possible. The main reason for these hearings is to improve the accountability of the Reserve Bank  both directly to Parliament  and via the press coverage to the public more generally. In the spirit of increased accountability  I should  I suppose  be accountable for what I said to this Committee at the previous hearing  as well as for what I am going to say today. I covered a number of subjects at the previous hearing which I thought were important for an understanding of how the economy was going to perform over coming years. I also mentioned a couple of outcomes we expected for 1997. It is those which will probably be of the most immediate interest. I said that  after a sluggish 1996 where GDP had grown at about 3 per cent -- at one point  it got to not much more than 2 per cent on a 12-months-ended basis  we should expect it to pick up to about 4 per cent in 1997. I also said that I expected inflation to stay at the bottom of the 2-3 per cent range  with the possibility that it could go a little lower for a while. Now I think I could be excused for wanting to walk away from earlier forecasts as a result of the current turmoil in Asian and world financial markets. While I intend to say quite a lot about those events later on  I do not propose to invoke that excuse at this stage  because they have not had any effect on the economy to date. They have affected financial markets  but not the economy yet. Instead  I want to start by saying that the baseline we have to work from  i.e.  the growth of the economy in the first three quarters of 1997  has been at least as good as I was pointing to in May  if not a little better. We now have the GDP growth rates for the first two quarters of 1997  which show the economy grew at an annual rate of nearly 4 per cent during that time. And we have further monthly figures for the September quarter which are somewhat stronger than those recorded during the first half of the year. This is true for the major monthly indicators such as retail trade  imports and exports. It is also true for the labour market  especially for vacancies  and to some extent also for employment. There is also evidence from the business surveys that confidence is picking up  but these surveys were generally compiled before the Asian headlines of a fortnight ago. BIS Review 103/1997 - 2 - On inflation  the outlook changed a little. New figures brought underlying inflation below 2 per cent  and our on-going assessment caused us to lower our forecasts. As a result  we have had two further easings of monetary policy -- one in May and one in July. An important reason for the lower inflation forecasts was the better outlook for wages. You may recall that shortly after the previous hearing in May we received revised figures on earnings from the ABS that suggested not only that they were lower in the quarter in question -- the March quarter of 1997 -- but that an upward trend had been revised away. This better picture was confirmed again in the June quarter figures  but the picture has been muddied somewhat by the recent September quarter figures which show an unexpectedly strong rise. On balance  therefore  we at the Bank judged that the information becoming available over the past six months was tending to confirm this relatively benign view of the future -- GDP growth of about 4 per cent (enough for some further reduction in unemployment from the 8.8 per cent we had at the time of the last hearing) and inflation a little below 2 per cent (enough to justify the May and July easings in monetary policy). The picture was not all rosy -- the slower output growth of 1996 was still making its presence felt in the form of sluggish employment growth in the first half of 1997  there were some doubts about the strength of investment  and the effects of El Niño were around the corner. But economies nearly always present a mixed picture  and this mixture was a lot better than most. In addition  financial conditions had become clearly easier than in May. The overnight cash rate had come down from 6 per cent to 5 per cent as a result of the two easings of monetary policy  and yields on 10-year bonds were down from 7¾ per cent to 6 per cent. The exchange rate against the US dollar has come down from 77.7 US cents to 70.3 US cents; against the trade-weighted index  it has come down from 60.2 to 57.0. I come now to the point where I should say a few things about what has been happening in Asia and the rest of the world. I will do my best to be specific  but you should bear in mind that the ground is constantly changing. The first thing I would like to say is that in the long run I am still very optimistic about Asian growth prospects. These countries still retain a set of characteristics that are conducive to long-run growth: they can still achieve rapid productivity growth through technology transfer  i.e.  they have started from a long way behind and have a fair way to go; they are oriented towards international trade; they have high savings rates and high investment and a relatively small government sector; they have generally sound fiscal and monetary policies -- although they have got some way to go in terms of the soundness of their banking and financial sectors; and they have great respect for  and devote considerable effort to  education. I do not see the end of the Asian miracle  partly because I do not think it ever was a miracle; it was just the application of some tried and tested rules of good economic policy. It is still fortunate for our long-run prosperity that we have strong links to Asia. BIS Review 103/1997 - 3 - Having declared my optimism about the long run  I should now turn to the short run. Clearly  there are going to be difficulties here  in particular among four ASEAN countries -- Thailand  Malaysia  Indonesia and the Philippines. From the moment the Thai baht was floated on 2 July  attention quickly broadened to encompass these four. Their currencies have fallen sharply  as have their stock markets and property prices. These countries are battening down the hatches -- in two cases with the help of the IMF -- to sort out their problems. The principal problem  it is now apparent  concerns how to handle the fall of previously over-inflated asset prices  undisciplined lending by local banks and foreigners  and some very opaque inter-relationships between business and government which have obscured the true financial position of a lot of companies and banks. There also appears to have been over-investment in some areas. Property played its usual major role  but on this occasion there were also more contemporary avenues  particularly electronics and semi-conductors  where there is clear over-capacity and intense competition among these countries (and with Korea and Taiwan). Of course  these problems have been around for years -- they did not just start on 2 July. A part of this adjustment must inevitably involve a sharp curtailment of growth in the short run and a contraction of credit. Imports will fall  and so the effects will be spread to other countries. The good news for Australia is that these four countries account for only 10 per cent of Australia’s exports. If the difficulties remain confined to these four countries  the effect on Australia’s exports  and hence our growth  would be modest. The rest of Asia is  in fact  a lot more important to Australia. Japan -- our largest market -- has been limping along at an average annual growth rate of about 1 per cent now for about five years. Our exports to Japan have virtually not increased at all during that period. The other big Asian markets for Australia are Korea  China  Taiwan and Hong Kong. These are collectively much more important than the ASEAN four. Of course  some of the underlying problems that afflict the ASEAN four also apply  although more modestly  to some of these countries. For a time  it looked as though the ASEAN problems would spill over to these in a big way  but that seems less likely now  although we should not speak too soon. Even so  we should build in the assumption of some slowing in aggregate for these countries. To judge the effects on Australia  we should  in principle  have a view on how each country will fare in regard to economic growth  imports and the health of their banking systems (and we should look outside Asia  which I will do later). It is never easy and some sure bets turn out to be wrong. For example  virtually everyone thought the simultaneous share market crash of 1987 and associated company failures would presage at least a slowdown  if not a recession. In the event  1988 turned out to be a boom year for the OECD economy and for Australia. Let us hope we can be a little closer to the mark this time. Most analysis to date has consisted of a relatively mechanical application of lower growth and lower imports among the ASEAN four to lower Australian exports and lower Australian GDP growth. The orders of magnitudes are quite small and the most commonly cited figure for GDP growth in Australia is a reduction of about a quarter of a percentage point. According to press reports  the OECD has recently suggested figures of 0.3 per cent for Australia in 1997 and 0.4 per cent in 1998. Quite how they got an effect on 1997  which we are already 80 per cent through  I do not know  but  as I said  I am only relying on newspaper reports. These sorts of figures can become considerably larger if we also bring in lower growth rates for Korea  China  etc.  but we are getting into the realms of speculation if we do so. BIS Review 103/1997 - 4 - The only guide that we have is that this will not be the first time that it has happened. In 1984 and 1985 we saw a big drop in Asian currencies and a big drop in their growth rates. It had the predicted effect and our exports to Asia for a time were quite weak. Again  last year -- in calendar 1996 -- there was zero growth of imports in the ASEAN four  and our exports to them slowed. I think we will have to put up with a period of weakness again. Frustrating as this instability may be  it seems to be an inevitable part of an open competitive economic system which is the only type capable of achieving strong growth in the long run. So far I have only talked about Asia  but the outcome for the world economy will depend on more than Asia. We have to bring in two bigger regions -- North America and Europe. North America (mainly the United States but also including Canada and Mexico) is growing quite strongly. The recent disturbances in financial markets which were imported into North America from Asia do not seem to have had a lasting impact. If anything  their main effect seems to have been to hose down some overheated asset markets slightly  and hence to reduce the likelihood of an imminent tightening of US monetary policy. Such a tightening in the next six months cannot be ruled out  however. Europe is finally recording some gains after years of disappointingly slow recovery from the early 1990s recession. In fact  European growth has picked up to the point where six European central banks recently tightened monetary policy slightly to head off possible inflationary pressures down the track. So far  I have talked about Asian and world economic events as though their only effect on Australia was via our exports. Of course  that is only part of the story. The other important part is that we now have to face the possibility of further financial market instability. For better or for worse  through knowledge or through fear  the international investment community is taking a more sceptical look at things Asian  and that includes all countries in the Asian region  including Australia. That means they have become more risk-averse  and more likely to judge countries and their policies harshly. We have already seen some of the effects on some Asian countries: falling exchange rates; falling share prices; rising risk margins in interest rates; downgrades by rating agencies. We are in a better position to handle this financial instability than we have been at any stage in the last 30 years. We formerly had a reputation as a boom-bust economy  and investors used to build in quite a large premium for risk when holding Australian assets. We have come a long way in convincing investors that this is largely a thing of the past. A good example of this is that our bond yields are now virtually the same as US bond yields  whereas five years or ten years ago it was not uncommon for the gap to be as high as five percentage points; some of this was a risk premium and some of it reflected our higher inflation. Another example is that the Australian dollar used to be one of the most volatile currencies in the world  whereas in the 1990s it has been no more volatile than the major currencies such as the US dollar  the yen or the Deutsche Mark. BIS Review 103/1997 - 5 - Over the past four or five months  this has served us well. While the Australian dollar has gone down a fair amount against the US dollar  it remained relatively steady in trade-weighted terms. It is true that over the last fortnight the Australian dollar has declined in trade-weighted terms  but it has done this in a relatively orderly fashion  and it is not an unreasonable market response given that our export markets have weakened. This new-found reputation for stability may surprise some people  because there is still a tendency to read so much into the small month-by-month or quarter-by-quarter variations in economic statistics. But if we take a longer sweep  we can see how many of the economic problems that used to concern us have now been eliminated  or are at least under some reasonable sort of control. The headlines are no longer full of stories about the current account deficit or the level of foreign debt. The budget deficit is small. High inflation and its inevitable twin  high interest rates  no longer fill the papers. This does not mean  of course  that we have solved all our economic problems  but we have clearly narrowed them down. This has also tended to concentrate minds on the one that remains -- namely  the level of unemployment. This is a reasonable priority because less progress has been achieved on unemployment than on the other imbalances in the economy that came to the fore in the mid-1970s and persisted through the 1980s. It is not as though no progress has been made -- the unemployment rate has come down from a peak of 11.2 per cent to its present 8.6 per cent -- but it has been disappointing progress. With six years of the expansion now behind us at an average growth rate of 3.6 per cent per annum -- the third highest in the OECD area -- we could have hoped for more. I think some further progress can be made over the next year  although we have to accept that it will probably be slow  and monetary policy will only be part of the story -- in the long run  only a small part. History suggests this will remain the case. Australia moved from 2 per cent unemployment to over 10 per cent in the decade from 1973 to 1983. The damage was really done during that period. Despite good output and employment growth in the 1980s expansion  the unemployment rate was back to 11 per cent following the 1990 recession. So in net terms no progress had been made in a decade. What we want this time is good growth in output and employment  with a difference -- we want it to last a lot longer. The six-and-a-half years that the previous two economic expansions lasted was not good enough. Although progress was made in reducing unemployment -- particularly in the second one -- it was all lost in the ensuing recession. This time around we must make sure we have a much longer expansion  reducing the likelihood and severity of any future slowdown as much as possible. I do not know how that will be possible  but the surest way of ameliorating the business cycle in this way is to avoid the imbalances occurring during the later stages of the expansion. The main imbalance in Australia  as elsewhere  has always been the emergence of inflation. The story is never exactly the same -- inflation can be accompanied by a wage push  an asset price boom or an external imbalance -- but the result has been the same following each of the past three booms. That is why we need to have a more medium-term focus in our monetary policy and why the inflation target is such a central part of it. The inflation target is not anti-growth; low inflation is not an end in itself  we are interested in sustaining a good inflation performance because we are interested in growth and employment. Keeping inflation in check is the key to longer expansions. It has sometimes been said that we are too cautious in following this policy. I think that is a little unfair. Of course  we are cautious in that we like to look at a range of BIS Review 103/1997 - 6 - information and think carefully before we make a move on monetary policy. But we try to be forward looking and pre-emptive. For example  we did not wait till measured inflation was below 2 per cent before easing -- in fact  it was 3.1 per cent when we first eased in July last year. Similarly  there have been suggestions that the Reserve Bank has a speed limit above which the economy cannot be allowed to grow (the figure usually cited was 3½ per cent). Such a suggestion is  of course  incorrect and I have pointed this out on several occasions. In case there is still any doubt  you only have to look at our behaviour in 1997. As I said earlier  the economy has been growing at 4 per cent per annum so far in 1997  yet it did not stop us easing monetary policy twice this year. If we are getting reasonable news on inflation and our inflation forecasts are in good shape  we have no objection to the economy growing by 4 per cent or 4 per cent plus. When looking at the whole picture of employment and unemployment  monetary policy is only a small part of the story  and it mainly concerns the cyclical aspect of unemployment. If you look at the really big changes in employment or unemployment over decades  rather than years  monetary policy plays a very small role. The biggest change in employment performance of which I am aware is the contrast between the United States and continental Europe. In the United States  the unemployment rate is back to its 1960s level  whereas in Europe it is about five times as high as it was in the 1960s. A few European countries have done better than that -- including the United Kingdom -- but others have done worse. If you try to explain the superior US employment result by faster economic growth you get nowhere. Europe has grown as fast as the United States over three decades -- it just has not generated jobs. The explanations for the poor European performance on jobs all centre around various types of rigidities  especially in wages and conditions of employment  but also the social security system and the difficulties involved in starting businesses and the subsequent lack of entrepreneurship. I do not intend to go into this in any depth because it is a huge topic. I only raise it to point out that there is much more to the story than the growth of demand  and the role that monetary policy plays in it. In other words  even if we succeed in having good economic growth and sustaining it for a longer period than in earlier expansions  it will not solve all our unemployment problems. We will make some progress  but it is too optimistic to think that we will be able to emulate the Americans and return to the 1960s level of unemployment through macro-economic policies alone. I saw in the paper yesterday someone from ACOSS saying that the big challenge for Australia was to achieve US-style economic growth and low unemployment without US-style inequality and poverty. I think this is a realistic way of looking at it. It shows an awareness of the current trade-off  and I suspect a hope that  with some ingenuity  we might be able to improve on it somewhat. My only quibble is that we already have achieved US growth rates -- in fact  exceeded them -- it is the US unemployment rate that has eluded us. This is something that people like myself  who studied economics in the 1960s  find surprising. In the 1960s it was the United States that was always criticised by countries like Australia and most of Europe for their high unemployment. Now the boot is on the other foot. There is a lot more that I could talk about  but I will confine myself to only one further topic. That is the subject of bank lending and bank margins  particularly bank lending to small business. This is a subject that this Committee has taken a particular interest in. In fact  the first large-scale inter-country study of Australian banks’ margins and banks’ profitability was BIS Review 103/1997 - 7 - undertaken by the Reserve Bank at the request of this Committee in August 1994. We did another study at the Committee’s request recently which was published in our October Bulletin. As Committee members also know  the Reserve Bank has been meeting with its Small Business Finance Advisory Panel since 1993 to discuss the provision of finance to that sector. We formed this Panel because we were worried that banks had become excessively risk-averse and were reluctant to lend to small business in the early part of the recovery from the 1990/91 recession. It has been a slow process  but competitive pressures have been gradually working their way into banks’ margins  i.e.  the difference between the average rate they earn on their loans and the average rate they pay on their deposits. These margins are now lower than at any time since we have been collecting the statistics  and the biggest fall has occurred over the past two years. Clearly  the entry of mortgage originators into the housing market was a very important development  and it led to the margin on housing lending falling from a level which was high by international standards to one which is about average. We are now beginning to see hotter competition in lending to small and medium-sized businesses. Partly this is a result of the need felt by many banks  particularly the regional ones  to reduce their reliance on the now much less profitable mortgage market. In this sense  it shows how competition slowly works its way through the system. I confess that it has taken longer than I expected  and longer than I hoped  but we are finally getting there. That brings me to the end of my introductory remarks. We have certainly had a very eventful period in the month leading up to this meeting and we have all been working hard to keep up with events  particularly in the international scene.

r971119a,1997-11-19,https://www.bis.org/review/r971119a.pdf,Mr. Kelley's testimony to the US House of Representatives Committee on Banking and Financial Services (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  4 Nov 97),Testimony by Mr. Edward W. Kelley Jr.  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  before the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the US House of Representatives  in Washington DC  on 4/11/97.,Mr. Kelley's testimony to the US House of Representatives Committee on Banking and Financial Services Testimony by Mr. Edward W. Kelley Jr.  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  before the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the US House of Representatives  in Washington DC  on 4/11/97. I am pleased to appear before the Committee today to discuss the Federal Reserve’s efforts to address the Year 2000 computer systems issue. The Federal Reserve System has developed and is executing a comprehensive plan to ensure its own Year 2000 readiness and the bank supervision function is well along in a cooperative  interagency effort  to promote timely remediation and testing by the banking industry. This afternoon I will focus on actions being taken by the Federal Reserve System to address our internal systems  coordination with the industry  and contingency planning.Background The Federal Reserve operates several payments applications that process and settle payments and securities transactions between depository institutions in the United States. Three of these applications are the Fedwire funds transfer  Fedwire securities transfer  and Automated Clearing House (ACH) applications. The first two applications are large-value payments mechanisms for U.S. dollar interbank funds transfers and U.S. government securities transfers. Users of the applications are primarily depository institutions and government agencies. The Fedwire funds transfer system is a real-time credit transfer system used primarily for payments related to interbank funds transfers such as Fed funds transactions  interbank settlement transactions  and “third-party” payments between the customers of depository institutions. Funds transferred over Fedwire are immediately final; they cannot be revoked after they have been accepted and processed by the Federal Reserve. About 10 000 depository institutions use the Fedwire funds transfer system to transfer each year approximately 86 million payments valued at over $280 trillion. The current average total daily value of Fedwire funds transfers is approximately $1.1 trillion. The Fedwire securities transfer system supports the safekeeping  clearing  and settlement of U.S. government securities in both the primary and secondary markets. It provides custody of U.S. government securities in book-entry form  as well as the transfer of securities ownership among market participants. On the custody side  the system calculates and credits interest and principal payments to the holders of securities  reconciles outstanding securities balances with issuers  and performs other record keeping and collateral safekeeping functions. On the transfer side  the called delivery-versus-payment  thus reducing the settlement risks of market participants. About 8 000 depository institutions use the Fedwire securities transfer service to transfer each year approximately 13 million securities valued at over $160 trillion. The average total daily value of Fedwire securities transfers is about $650 billion. system delivers book-entry simultaneous payment  securities against a The ACH is an electronic payment service that supports both credit and debit transactions and is used by approximately 14 000 financial institutions  400 000 companies  and an estimated 50 million consumers. Typical credit transactions include direct deposit of payroll and corporate payments to suppliers. Typical debit transactions include the collection of mortgage and loan payments and corporate cash concentration transactions. The ACH processes transactions in batches one or two days before they are scheduled to settle. ACH transactions are settled through depository institutions’ accounts at the Federal Reserve Banks. Approximately 4 billion ACH transactions were processed in 1996 with a total value of approximately $12 trillion. About 3.3 billion of these payments were commercial transactions; 625 million payments were originated by the Federal government. BIS Review 104/1997 - 2 - The Reserve Banks’ critical applications  such as Fedwire funds and securities transfer  ACH  and supporting accounting systems  run on mainframe computer systems operated by Federal Reserve Automation Services (FRAS)  the internal organizational unit that processes applications on behalf of the Federal Reserve Banks and operates the Federal Reserve’s national network. These critical applications are “centralized”  that is  one copy of the application is used by all twelve Reserve Banks. In addition to centralized applications on the mainframe  the Federal Reserve Banks operate a range of applications in a distributed computing environment  supporting business functions such as cash distribution  banking supervision and regulation  research  public information  and human resources. The Reserve Banks also operate check processing systems that provide check services the U.S. government. A national communications network  called FEDNET  supports the exchange of information among the Reserve Banks  FRAS  and external organizations. The scope of the Federal Reserve’s Year 2000 activities includes all of these processing environments and the supporting telecommunications network. institutions and to depository Year 2000 Readiness It is crucial that the Federal Reserve provide reliable services to the nation’s banking system and financial markets. The Federal Reserve is giving the Year 2000 its highest priority  commensurate with our goal of maintaining the stability of the nation’s financial markets and payments systems  preserving public confidence  and supporting reliable government operations. We are taking a comprehensive approach to our preparedness which includes assessments of readiness  remediation  and testing. The Federal Reserve has completed application assessments and internal test plans  and we are currently renovating and testing software. We are also updating proven plans and techniques used during other times of operational stress in order to be prepared to address potential century date change difficulties. All Federal Reserve computer program changes  as well as system and user-acceptance testing  are scheduled to be completed by year-end 1998. Further  critical financial services systems that interface with the depository institutions will be Year 2000-ready by mid-1998. This schedule will permit approximately 18 months for customer testing  to which we are dedicating considerable support resources. A large cadre of top personnel in the Federal Reserve System have been assigned to this task. Our staff is putting in many extra hours to prepare for testing with customers  planning for business continuity in the event of any unanticipated problems with internal systems  and enhancing our ability to respond to possible Year 2000-related operating failures of depository institutions. Assuring compliance internally is requiring review of approximately 90 million lines of computer code. While there are challenges and a great deal of work before us  I can report that we expect to be fully prepared for the century date change. The Federal Reserve recognized the potential problem with two-digit date fields more than five years ago when we began consolidating our mainframe data processing operations. Our new centralized mission-critical applications  such as Fedwire funds transfer  Fedwire securities transfer  and ACH  were designed from inception with Year 2000 compliance in mind. The mainframe consolidation effort also necessitated extensive application standardization  which required us to complete a comprehensive inventory of our mainframe applications  a necessary first step to effective remediation. Like our counterparts in the private sector  the Federal Reserve System still faces substantial challenges in achieving Year 2000 readiness. These challenges include managing a highly complex project involving multiple interfaces with others  ensuring the readiness of vendor components  ensuring the readiness of applications  thorough testing  and establishing contingency plans. We are also faced with labor market pressures that call for creative measures to retain staff who are critical to the success of our Year 2000 activities. BIS Review 104/1997 CDC Project Management According to industry experts  up to one-quarter of an organization’s Year 2000 compliance efforts are devoted to project management. Managing preparations for the century date change is particularly resource-intensive given the number of automated systems to be addressed  systems interrelationships and interdependencies  interfaces with external data sources and customers  and testing requirements. In addition  Year 2000 preparations must address many computerized environmental and facilities management systems such as power  heating and cooling  voice communications  elevators  and vaults. Our Year 2000 project is being closely coordinated among the Reserve Banks  the Board of Governors  numerous vendors and service providers  approximately 13 000 customers  and government agencies. In 1995  a Federal Reserve System-wide project was initiated  referred to as the Century Date Change (CDC) project  to coordinate the efforts of the Reserve Banks  FRAS  and the Board of Governors. Our project team is taking a three-part approach to achieve its objectives  focusing on planning  readiness  communication  and monitoring. Our planning began with a careful inventory of all applications and establishment of schedules and support mechanisms to ensure that readiness objectives are met. The readiness process involves performing risk assessments  modifying automated systems  and testing both internally and with depository institutions  service providers  and government agencies. We are stressing effective  consistent  and timely communication  both internal and external  to promote awareness and commitment at all levels of our own organization and the financial services industry  more generally. Some of our most senior executives are leading the project  and the Board and senior Bank management are now receiving formal  detailed status reports at least every 60 days. Any significant compliance issues will be reported to the Board immediately. The Reserve Banks’ internal audit departments and the Board’s oversight staff are also closely monitoring progress. A significant challenge in meeting our Year 2000 readiness objectives is our reliance on commercial hardware and software products and services. Much of our information processing and communications infrastructure is comprised of hardware and software products from third-party vendors. Additionally  the Federal Reserve utilizes commercial application software products and services for certain administrative functions and other operations. As a result  we must coordinate with numerous vendors and manufacturers to ensure that all of our hardware  software  and services are Year 2000-ready. In many cases  compliance will require upgrading  or even replacing  equipment and software. We have a complete inventory of vendor components used in our mainframe and distributed computing environments  and vendor coordination and system change are progressing well. These preparations also the Year 2000 readiness of telecommunications providers. include careful attention to Testing As we continue to assess our systems for Year 2000 readiness  we are well along in preparing a special central environment for testing our payment system applications. We are establishing isolated mainframe data processing environments to be used for internal testing of all system components as well as for testing with depository institutions and other government agencies. These environments will enable testing for high-risk dates  such as the rollover to the year 2000 and leap year processing. Testing will be conducted through a combination of future-dating our computer systems to verify the readiness of our infrastructure  and testing critical future dates within interfaces to other institutions. Our test environments will be configured to provide flexible and nearly continuous access by customers. Network communications components are also being tested and certified in a special test lab environment at FRAS. BIS Review 104/1997 - 4 - The testing effort for Year 2000 readiness within the Federal Reserve will be extensive and complex. Industry experts estimate that testing for readiness will consume more than half of total Year 2000 project resources. To leverage existing resources and processes  we are modelling our Year 2000 testing on proven testing methods and processes. Our customers are already familiar with these processes and the testing environment. We shared our testing strategy with depository institutions in October of this year  and we are currently developing a coordinated test schedule. As I noted earlier  the Reserve Banks are targeting June 1998 to commence testing with their depository institution customers  which allows an 18-month time period for depository institutions to test their systems with the Federal Reserve. All of these activities require that we retain highly skilled staff critical to the success of the project. As I mentioned earlier  we have placed the highest priority on our CDC project  and  as such  have allocated many of the best managers and technical staff in the Federal Reserve System to work on the project. The information technology industry is already experiencing market pressures due to the increased demand for technical talent. As the millennium draws closer  the global market requirements for qualified personnel will intensify even further. We are responding as necessary to these market-induced pressures by implementing programs to retain staff members in critical  high-demand positions. Our focus at the Board goes beyond the immediate need to prepare our systems and ensure reliable operation of the payments infrastructure. We are also working hard to address the supervisory issues raised by Year 2000 and are developing contingency plans which I will discuss later. Bank Supervision As a bank supervisor  the Federal Reserve has worked closely with the other supervisory agencies that are part of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) to alert the industry to our concerns and to monitor Year 2000 preparations of the institutions we supervise so that we can identify early and address problems that arise. Comptroller of the Currency Ludwig is testifying today as Chairman of the FFIEC to describe the interagency Year 2000 supervisory initiatives of all of the five member agencies (Federal Reserve  OCC  FDIC  OTS and NCUA)  so I will limit my comments on the Federal Reserve’s supervisory efforts. In May of this year  the Federal Reserve and the other regulatory agencies developed a uniform Year 2000 assessment questionnaire to collect information on a national basis. Based on the responses and other information  we believe the banking industry’s awareness level improved substantially during 1997 and is reflected in the intensified project management  planning  budgeting  and renovation efforts that have been initiated. Generally speaking  the nation’s largest banking organizations have done much to address the issues and have devoted significant financial and human resources to preparing for the century date change. Many larger banks are already renovating their operating systems and have commenced testing of their critical applications. Large organizations seem generally capable of renovating their critical operating systems by year-end 1998  and will have their testing well underway by then. Smaller banks  including the U.S. offices of foreign banks and those dependent on a third party to provide their computer services  are generally aware of the issues and are working on the problem; however  their progress is less measurable and is being carefully monitored. We are directing significant attention to ensure that these banks intensify their efforts to prepare for the Year 2000. BIS Review 104/1997 Major third-party service providers and software vendors serving the banking industry are acutely aware of the issue and are working diligently to address it. Most of these suppliers consider their Year 2000 capability to be a business survival issue  as it is of critical importance to their ability to remain competitive in an aggressive industry. By mid-year 1998 we will have conducted a thorough Year 2000 preparedness examination of every bank  U.S. branch and agency of a foreign bank  and service provider that we supervise. Our examination program includes a review of each organization’s Year 2000 project management plans in order to evaluate their sufficiency  to ensure the direct involvement of senior management and the board of directors  and to monitor their progress against the plan. As we proceed through the examination process  we are identifying any institutions that require intensified supervisory attention and establishing our priorities for subsequent examinations. International Awareness With regard to the international aspects of the Year 2000 issue  U.S. offices of foreign banks pose a unique set of challenges. We are concerned about the possibility that some offices may not have an adequate appreciation of the magnitude and ramifications of the problem  and may not as yet have committed the resources necessary to address the issues effectively. This is a particular concern for foreign bank offices that are dependent on their foreign parent bank for information processing systems. In addition  we are increasingly concerned that the foreign branches of U.S. banks may be adversely affected if counterparties in foreign markets are not ready for the Year 2000. Therefore  we are working through the Bank for International Settlements’ (BIS) Committee on Banking Supervision  composed of many of the international supervisory agencies responsible for the foreign banks that operate in the United States. Through formal and informal discussions  the distribution of several interagency statements and advisories  and the Federal Reserve’s Year 2000 video (see below) to the BIS supervisors committee  we have sought to elevate foreign bank supervisors’ awareness of the risks posed by the century date change. The G-10 governors issued an advisory in September that included a paper by the bank supervisors committee on the Year 2000 challenge to banks and bank supervisors around the world to ensure a higher level of awareness and activity on their part. The BIS supervisors committee has developed a survey sent to about 40 countries to collect better information on the state of readiness of banks in those countries and the extent of the efforts of the bank supervisors to address the issues locally and internationally. The surveys will be evaluated and the findings distributed early next year. Also on the international front  William McDonough  President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  in a keynote address to the annual meeting of the Institute of International Finance in Hong Kong  emphasized the importance of planning for the century date change on an international basis and the significant risk to financial markets posed by the Year 2000. We also participated in the BIS meeting sponsored by the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems and the Group of Computer Experts for G-10 and major non-G-10 central banks in September which provided a forum to share views on and approaches to dealing with Year 2000 issues  and we have been active in various private sector forums. The majority of foreign central banks are confident that payment and settlement applications under their management will be Year 2000-ready. Like the Federal Reserve  however  the operation of foreign central bank payment systems is dependent on compliant products from hardware and software suppliers and the readiness of telecommunication service providers. The approach of foreign central banks toward raising bank industry awareness varies widely. Information garnered from this meeting and similar meetings planned for the future will assist the BIS Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems  as well as the Federal Reserve  in understanding the state of preparedness of payment systems on a global level. BIS Review 104/1997 Public Awareness - 6 - We are mindful that extensive communication with the industry and the public is crucial to the success of century date change efforts. Our public awareness program concentrates on communications with the financial services industry related to our testing efforts and our overall concerns about the industry’s readiness. We continue to advise our bank customers of the Federal Reserve’s plans and time frames for making our software Year 2000-ready. We have inaugurated a Year 2000 industry newsletter and have just published our first bulletin addressing specific technical issues. We would be glad to provide you with copies of our recent newsletter and the bulletin. We have also established an Internet Web site to provide depository institutions with information regarding the Federal Reserve System’s CDC project. This site can be accessed at the following Internet address: http://www.frbsf.org/fiservices/cdc. On behalf of the FFIEC  the Federal Reserve has developed a Year 2000 information distribution system  including an Internet Web site and a toll free Fax Back service (888-882-0982). The Web site provides easy access to policy statements  guidance to examiners  and paths to other Year 2000 Web sites available from numerous other sources. The FFIEC Year 2000 Web site can be accessed at the following Internet address: http://www.ffiec.gov/y2k. The Federal Reserve has also produced a ten-minute video entitled “Year 2000 Executive Awareness” intended for viewing by a bank’s board of directors and senior management. The video presents a summary of the Year 2000 five-phase project management plan outlined in the interagency policy statement. In my introductory remarks on the video  I note that senior bank officials should be directly involved in managing the Year 2000 project to ensure that it is given the appropriate level of attention and sufficient resources to address the issue on a timely basis. The video can be ordered through the Board’s Web site. Contingency Planning While we will continue our public outreach efforts  our main focus is preparedness. Because smooth and uninterrupted financial flows are obviously of utmost importance  our main focus is on our readiness and the avoidance of problems. But we know from experience that upon occasion  things can go wrong. Given our unique role as the nation’s central bank  the Federal Reserve has always stressed contingency planning -- for both systemic risks as well as operational failures. In this regard  we regularly conduct exhaustive business resumption tests of our major payment systems that include depository institutions. Moreover  as a result of our experience in responding to problems arising from such diverse events as earthquakes  fires  storms  and power outages  as well as liquidity problems in institutions  we expect to be appropriately positioned to deal with similar problems in the financial sector that might arise as a result of CDC. However  CDC presents many unique situations. For example  in the software application arena  the normal contingency of falling back to a prior release of the software is not a viable option. We are  of course  developing specific CDC contingency plans to address various operational scenarios  and our contingency planning includes preparation to address unanticipated problems when we bring our systems into production as Year 2000 begins. Key technical staff will be ready to respond quickly to problems with our computer and network systems. We are establishing procedures with our primary vendors to ensure direct communication and appropriate recourse should their products fail at Federal Reserve installations during Year 2000 date processing. Our existing business resumption plans will be updated to address date-related difficulties that may face the financial industry. We already have arrangements in place to assist financial institutions in the event they are unable to access their own systems. For example  we are able to provide financial institutions with BIS Review 104/1997 access to Federal Reserve computer terminals on a limited basis for the processing of critical funds transfers. This contingency arrangement has proven highly effective when used from time to time by depository institutions experiencing major hardware/software outages or that have had their operations disrupted due to natural disasters such as the Los Angeles earthquake  hurricane Hugo in the Carolinas  and hurricane Andrew in south Florida. In these cases we worked closely with financial institutions to ensure that adequate supplies of cash were available to the community  and we arranged for our operations to function virtually without interruptions for 24 hours a day during the crisis period. We feel the experience gained from such crises will prove very helpful in the event of similar problems triggered by the century date change. We are formulating responses for augmenting certain functions  such as computer help desk services and off-line funds transfers  to respond to short-term needs for these services. Beyond reliance on a sound plan and effective execution of the plan  the Federal Reserve provides several different payment services  such as Fedwire  ACH  check  and cash; therefore  the banking industry is not totally dependent upon any single system for executing payments. Alternatives are available in the event of a disruption in a segment of the electronic payment system. We recognize that despite their best efforts  some depository institutions may experience operating difficulties  either as a result of their own computer problems or those of their customers  counterparties  or others. These problems could be manifested in a number of ways and would not necessarily involve funding shortfalls. Nevertheless  the Federal Reserve is always prepared to provide information to depository institutions on the balances in their accounts with us throughout the day  so that they can identify shortfalls and seek funding in the market. The Federal Reserve will be prepared to lend in appropriate circumstances and with adequate collateral to depository institutions when market sources of funding are not reasonably available. The terms and conditions of such lending may depend upon the circumstances giving rise to the liquidity shortfall. Our preparations for possible liquidity difficulties also extend to the foreign bank branches and agencies in the U.S. that may be adversely affected directly by their own computer systems or through difficulties caused by the linkage and dependence on their parent bank. Such circumstances would necessitate coordination with the home country supervisor. Moreover  consistent with current policy  foreign central banks will be expected to provide liquidity support to any of their banking organizations that experience a funding shortfall. Closing Remarks As I indicated at the outset  the Federal Reserve views its Year 2000 preparations with great seriousness. As such  we have placed a high priority on the remediation of date problems in our systems and the development of action plans that will ensure business continuity for the critical financial systems we operate. While we have made significant progress and are on schedule in validating our internal systems and preparing for testing with depository institutions and others using Federal Reserve services  we must work to ensure that our efforts remain on schedule and that problems are addressed in a timely fashion. In particular  we will be paying special attention to the testing needs of depository institutions and the financial industry and are prepared to adjust our support for them as required by experience. We believe that we are well-positioned to meet our objectives and will remain vigilant throughout the process. As a bank supervisor  the Federal Reserve will continue to address the industry’s preparedness  monitor progress  and target for special supervisory attention those organizations that are most in need of assistance. Lastly  we will continue to participate in international forums with the expectation that these efforts will help foster an international awareness of Year 2000 issues and provide for the sharing of experiences  ideas  and best practices.

Phillips  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at Houston Baptist University  Houston  Texas on 30/10/97.,Ms. Phillips discusses trends and challenges in Federal Reserve bank supervision Remarks by Ms. Susan M. Phillips  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at Houston Baptist University  Houston  Texas on 30/10/97. Trends and Challenges in Federal Reserve Bank Supervision I am pleased to be here today to talk with you about some of the important  fundamental changes taking place within the U.S. banking system and the effects those changes are having on the Federal Reserve’s supervisory process. As you know  the U.S. economy and banking system have enjoyed more than half a decade of improving strength and prosperity in which U.S. banks have become better capitalized and more profitable than they have been in generations. Moreover  in the past 13 months not a single insured bank has failed  and the Bank Insurance Fund is now capitalized at a level requiring most banks to pay only nominal fees for their insurance. While this situation is a vast improvement over conditions in earlier years  experience has demonstrated that at times like these -- if we are not vigilant -- risks can occur that set the stage for future problems. That’s what makes supervising banks so interesting and such a challenge. When the economy and the banking industry are in difficulty  supervisors must identify and address immediate problems in an effort to protect the U.S. taxpayer and the federal safety net. When conditions are good  as they are today  supervisors have the opportunity to review their oversight process and promote sound practices for managing banking risks in an effort to avert or mitigate future problems. This and keeping up with the pace of financial innovation and industry change that has occurred in the past 5 to 10 years has been a challenge  indeed. As I begin my remarks  I would like to point out that no system of supervision or regulation can provide total assurance that banking problems will not occur or that banks will not fail. Nor should it. Any process that prevents all banking problems would be extremely invasive to banking organizations and would likely inhibit economic growth. As financial intermediaries  banks must take risks if they and their communities are to grow. As risk-takers  some banks will necessarily incur losses  and some will eventually fail. The objective is to contain the costs of risk-taking  both to Therefore  our goal as regulators is to help identify weak banking practices so that small or emerging problems can be addressed before they become large and costly. To do that in today’s markets  and in an environment in which technology and financial innovation can lead to rapid change  the Federal Reserve is pursuing a more risk-focused supervisory approach. We are well underway toward implementing this new supervisory framework  and initial indications about it -- from both examiners and bankers -- have been favorable. This risk-focused approach to supervision is seen as a necessary response to a variety of factors: the growing complexity and pace of change within the industry  the increasingly global nature of U.S. and world financial markets  and the methods available today for managing and controlling risk. As banking practices and markets continue to evolve  I believe this emphasis on risk-focused supervision will be even more necessary in the years to come. What is “Risk-Focused Supervision? With that introduction  let me clarify what I mean by risk-focused supervision. How does it differ from the way supervisors have traditionally done their job? What does it mean to the BIS Review 104/1997 - 2 - banking system? What is it? In short  risk-focused supervision simply means that in conducting bank examinations and other supervisory activities  we will seek to direct our attention and resources to the areas that we perceive pose the greatest risk to banks. In many respects  that would seem rather obvious and hardly earth shaking  and in many ways it is  indeed  nothing new. The Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies have long sought to identify exceptions and to prioritize examination activities. In the past  though  the business of bank supervision has focused on validating bank balance sheets  particularly the value of loan portfolios  which have been historically the principal source of problems for banks. Much of the prior emphasis was on determining the condition of a bank at a point in time. In the process  we would go through the balance sheet  assuring ourselves that a bank’s assets and liabilities were essentially as stated and that its reserves and net worth were real. As part of the process  there was a review of sound management practices  internal controls  and strong internal audit activities  but that review was not the initial or primary focus. In earlier times that approach was adequate  since bank balance sheets were generally slow to change. Banks held their loans to maturity; they acquired deposits locally and at a pace similar to local economic growth; their product lines were stable; and management turnover  itself  was typically low. By tracking the quality of loans and other assets  examiners could generally detect deterioration and other business problems through their periodic on-site examinations. If done often enough  those examinations typically gave authorities sufficient time to take action and to either close or sell a bank before the losses became significant to the deposit insurance fund. Developments Driving Change During the past decade  though  the U.S. banking system experienced a great deal of turmoil  stress  and change. Ten years ago  many of the country’s largest banks announced huge loan loss provisions  beginning the process of reducing the industry’s overhang of doubtful developing country loans. At the same time  many of these institutions and smaller regional banks were struggling with energy and agricultural sector difficulties or accumulating commercial real estate problems. I am sure that many of you here today can easily recall those times  and that these and other difficulties took a heavy toll -- if not in your own banks  in those of your competitors. By the end of the 1980s  more than 200 banks were failing annually  and there were more than 1 000 banks on the FDIC problem list. This experience provided important lessons and forced supervisors and bankers  alike  to reconsider the way they approached their jobs. For their part  bankers recognized the need to rebuild their capital and reserves  strengthen their internal controls  diversify their risks  and improve their practices for identifying  underwriting  and managing risk. Supervisors were also reminded of the need to remain vigilant and of the high costs that bank failures can bring  not only to the insurance fund but to local communities as well. The FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 emphasized that point  requiring frequent examinations and prompt regulatory actions when serious problems emerge. Beyond these mostly domestic events  banks and businesses throughout the world were dealing in the 1980s and 1990s with new technologies that were leading to a multitude of new and increasingly complex financial products that changed the nature of banking and financial markets. These technologies have brought about an endless variety of derivative instruments  increased securitization  ATMs  and a broader range of banking products. By lowering information costs  they have also led to dramatic improvements in risk management and have expanded the marketing and service capabilities of banks and their competitors. In large part  these changes and innovations are unequivocally good for society and have produced more efficient markets and  in turn  greater international trade and economic growth. BIS Review 104/1997 They have also  however  greatly increased the complexity of banking and bank supervision. In both cases  these developments have spurred the demand for highly trained and qualified personnel. Within the United States  our banking system has also experienced a dramatic consolidation in the number of banking institutions  due not only to technology and financial innovation  but also to legislative changes allowing interstate banking. The number of independent commercial banking organizations has declined 40 percent since 1980 to 7 400 in June of this year. While possibly stressful to many bankers and bank customers  this dramatic structural change has also contributed to industry earnings by providing banks with greater opportunities to reduce costs. A challenge now for many institutions may be to manage their growth and the continuing process of industry consolidation. This challenge may be greatest as banking organizations expand into more diverse or nontraditional banking activities  particularly through acquisitions. Growth into a wider array of activities is especially important if banks are to meet the wide-ranging needs of their business and household customers  while competing effectively with other regulated and unregulated firms. As you know  the Congress has been wrestling with the issue of banking powers for years and -- with the exception of interstate branching -- has yet to make much progress. The Federal Reserve has long believed that legislation is needed and that the industry can best move forward if this issue is resolved by lawmakers  rather than by regulators in a piecemeal fashion. Nevertheless  with or without legislation  we must all deal with changing markets and with the opportunities and pressures they present. Utilizing existing legislative authority  regulators have been able to approve new banking products that were not available a decade ago  as financial markets and products have evolved. However  whether future expansion comes through new laws or merely through new interpretations of current laws and regulations  it is important that the banking industry use its powers wisely and that its performance remain sound. Supervisory Challenges Ahead In supervising this “industry-in-transition”  the Federal Reserve has no shortage of tasks  despite the virtually unprecedented strong condition of the U.S. banking system today. We  too  must deal with the evolving financial markets and advances in technology. At the same time  we must ensure that our own supervisory practices  tools  and standards take advantage of improving technology and financial techniques so that our oversight is not only effective  but also as unobtrusive and as appropriate as possible. These tasks are wide ranging  extending from our own re-engineering of the supervisory process to the way supervisors approach such issues as measuring capital adequacy and international convergence of supervisory standards. Constructing a sound supervisory process while minimizing regulatory burden has been a long-standing and on-going effort at the Federal Reserve and an objective we have sought to advance with our emphasis on risk-focused examinations. Particularly in the past decade  the development of new financial products and the greater depth and liquidity of financial markets have enabled banking organizations to change their risk profiles more rapidly than ever before. That possibility requires that we strike an appropriate balance between evaluating the condition of an institution at a point in time and evaluating the soundness of the bank’s on-going process for managing risk. The risk-focused approach  by definition  entails a more formal planning phase that identifies those areas and activities at risk that warrant the most extensive review. This pre-planning process is supported by technology  for example  to download certain information about a bank’s BIS Review 104/1997 - 4 - loan portfolio to our own computer systems and then  through off-site analysis  target areas of the portfolio for review. This revised process should be less disruptive to the daily activities of banks than earlier examination procedures and has the further advantage of reducing our own travel costs and improving examiner morale. Once on-site  examiners analyze the bank’s loans and other assets to ascertain the organization’s current condition  and also to evaluate its internal control process and its own ability to identify and resolve problems. As a result  the Federal Reserve is placing greater reliance than before on a bank’s internal auditors and on the accuracy and adequacy of bank information systems. The review of a bank’s information flow extends from top to bottom  and with the expectation that bank senior management and boards of directors are actively involved in monitoring the bank’s activities and providing sufficient guidance regarding their appetite for risk. As in the past  performance of substantive checks on the reliability of a bank’s controls remains an important element of the examination process  albeit in a more automated and advanced form. For example  we are pursuing ways to make greater use of loan sampling in order to generate statistically valid conclusions about the accuracy of a bank’s internal loan review process. To the extent we can validate the integrity of a bank’s internal controls more efficiently  we can place more confidence in them at an earlier stage and can also take greater comfort that management is providing itself with an accurate indication of the bank’s condition. Moreover  as examiners are able to complete loan reviews more quickly  they will have more time to review other high priority aspects of the institution’s operations. A significant benefit of the risk-focused approach is its emphasis on ensuring that the bank’s internal oversight processes are sound and that communication between the bank and Federal Reserve examiners occurs between examinations. That approach is generally supported by institutions we supervise and provides a more comprehensive oversight process that complements our annual or 18-month examination cycle. It also strengthens our ability to respond promptly if conditions deteriorate. Importantly  the Federal Reserve’s examination staff indicates that this risk-focused process may be reducing on-site examination time by 15-30 percent in many cases and overall examination time of Reserve Bank personnel by perhaps 10 percent. While those results are tentative  partial  and unscientific  they are certainly encouraging in terms of resource implications. Complementing the risk-focused approach to supervision are enhancements to the tools we use to grade a bank’s condition and management. Since 1995  we have asked our examiners to provide a specific supervisory rating for a bank’s risk management process. This Fed initiative preceded  but is quite consistent with  the more recent interagency decision to add an “S” to the end of the CAMEL rating. That “S”  as you know  addresses sensitivity to market risk and reflects in large part a bank’s ability to manage that risk. Any managers in the audience who are with U.S. offices of foreign banks may appreciate that these rating changes simply highlight the importance of risk management that the Federal Reserve has for some time emphasized in its review of foreign banks. How effective is the risk-focused process? Since economic and industry conditions have been so favorable in recent years  there has not been a sufficiently stressful economic downturn to provide a robust test. The market volatility beginning in 1994 offered some insights about supervisory judgements of the risk management systems of large trading banks  but there have been few other indications. Even the rise to record levels of delinquencies and defaults on credit card debt may reflect factors other than the ability of supervisors to ensure that management has all the important bases covered. The real test  of course  BIS Review 104/1997 would come with a major economic downturn. Even then  though  it will be hard to know what might have occurred had our oversight procedures not changed. Nevertheless  there are indications that both banking and supervisory practices are materially better now than they were in the 1980s and early 1990s. Because of technology and lower computer and communications costs  information is much more readily available than in earlier decades  and sound management practices are more widespread. Risk measurement and portfolio management techniques that were largely theoretical when some of us were in college are now fully operational in many banks. Moreover  the costly experience with bank and thrift failures in the early 1990s has not been forgotten. As a result  most bankers and business managers today have a greater appreciation  I believe  for the value of risk management and internal controls. To that point  we are finding  with increased frequency  that banks are designing personnel compensation systems to provide managers with greater incentives to control risk. Implementing a risk-focused supervisory approach has not been an easy task. It has required significant revisions to our broad and specialized training programs  including expansion of capital markets  risk assessment information technology  and global trading activities as well as courses devoted exclusively to internal controls. These education programs will  of course  need to be continually updated as industry activities and conditions evolve. With the greater discretion examiners now have to focus their efforts on areas of highest risk  it has also become more important that we ensure the consistency and overall quality of our examinations. To address that point  we have developed automated examination tools  based on a decision-tree framework  that will help guide examiners through the procedures most relevant to individual banks  given their specific circumstances and risk profiles. Moreover  both domestically and abroad  the Federal Reserve is working with other bank supervisors and with the banking industry to develop sound practices for management for a variety of bank activities. Initiatives in recent years include guidance on disclosure and on managing interest rate risk and derivative activities. Such efforts  and the growing worldwide recognition of the value of market forces  should lead to clearer expectations of supervisors  greater reliance on market discipline  and less intrusive regulation. In that connection  the Federal Reserve in recent years has worked closely with the FDIC and with state banking departments to coordinate our examination procedures and supervisory practices. A prime example of these efforts is the adoption last year of the State and Federal Protocol  through which we all seek to achieve a relatively seamless supervisory process for banks operating across state lines. We are also working together on a variety of automation efforts  some of which I have referred to already. The Year 2000 Under the category of “problems we don’t need”  I find it difficult to talk with bankers these days without raising the “Year 2000” problem. Fortunately  most U.S. banks appear to be taking this matter seriously and are generally well underway toward identifying their individual needs and developing action plans. Nevertheless  the Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies are actively reviewing the efforts of banks to address this vital issue. Some banks  particularly large ones  have stated  themselves  that if an institution is not already well underway toward resolving this problem  then it is already too late. I hope that all of you are giving this matter adequate attention  and are taking the steps necessary to ensure that changes are being made within your banks  and also by your vendors and customers. BIS Review 104/1997 - 6 - A critical aspect of the year 2000 problem is that we are all so inter-linked. Not only are we exposed to our own internal computer problems  but also to those with whom we do business. This matter has far-reaching implications for banks  covering not only operating risk  but also credit risk  liquidity risk  reputational risk  and others if material problems emerge. This is yet another illustration of the many challenges faced by bankers today. Conclusion In conclusion  the history of banking and of bank supervision shows a long and rather close relationship between the health of the banking system and the economy  a connection that reflects the role of banks in the credit intermediation process. We can expect that relationship to continue and for bank earnings and asset quality to fluctuate as economic conditions change. In many ways  however  the banking and financial system has changed dramatically in the past decade both in terms of its structure and the diversity of its activities. Risk management practices have also advanced  helped by technological and financial innovations. I believe that both bank supervisors and the banking industry have learned important lessons from the experience of the past ten years  specifically about the need to actively monitor  manage  and control risks. Through its supervisory process  the Federal Reserve seeks to maintain a proper balance: permitting banks maximum freedom  while still protecting the safety net and maintaining financial stability. Maintaining responsible banking and responsible bank supervision is the key. We must all work to identify risks and to ensure they are adequately monitored and controlled. That result will lead to better banking practices  to more stable earnings and asset quality for the industry  and to less regulatory and legislative risk. These are goals we all share.

Phillips  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the Asset/Liability and Treasury Management Conference of the Bank Administration Institute  Chicago  on 4/11/97.,Remarks by Ms. Phillips at the Asset/Liability and Treasury Management Conference of the Bank Administration Institute Remarks by Ms. Susan M. Phillips  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the Asset/Liability and Treasury Management Conference of the Bank Administration Institute  Chicago  on 4/11/97. It is a pleasure to be here to discuss the Federal Reserve’s perspective on risk management. As you know  advances in the methods and techniques in this area are having wide-ranging effects on the corporate decision making process in all types of business. The effects on banking institutions have been especially profound. Clearly  financial engineering and improvements in risk management have helped banks to expand product lines  offer more efficient services  and control the risks of ever more complex financial instruments and the growing volume of financial transactions. For some institutions  the application of new risk management techniques to specific areas is leading the way to a broader  firm-wide risk consciousness that is completely  and appropriately  transforming the entire corporate culture. This is particularly important since the very essence of banking and financial intermediation is the acceptance and management of risk. Adopting a “risk-focused” corporate culture from the highest levels of senior management down through business line personnel represents the ultimate product quality assurance program for individual customers and the financial system more generally. From the Federal Reserve’s perspective  effective risk management at financial institutions plays a critical role in helping to achieve our central bank responsibilities of: 1. promoting an efficient and effective financial system that adequately finances economic growth  and 2. ensuring that financial institutions do not become a source of systemic risk  or pose a threat to the payment system or burden taxpayers with losses arising from the federal safety net. Advances in risk management clearly help reduce potential systemic disruptions. The Federal Reserve  along with other supervisors both here and abroad  has focused increasing resources on encouraging developments in this area. Indeed  just as financial engineering and advances in risk management are changing the operating methods and business cultures of financial institutions  they are also transforming both the operations and the corporate culture of bank supervisors. While ultimate goals and objectives remain the same  over the past several years  supervisors have been moving to more “incentive-compatible” approaches to 1) foster sound risk management within the institution rather than compliance with narrow rules and regulations  2) minimize burden through the use of new examination approaches and internal risk measurement systems  and 3) reinforce market discipline. Fostering Sound Risk Management Key to almost all of these initiatives has been an increasing effort by supervisors to avoid locking themselves into formulaic  one-size-fits-all approaches to supervision and regulation. Too often financial engineering has been targeted at regulatory arbitrage -- that is  the exploitation of loopholes in narrow regulatory policies are based on old traditional instruments  activities or business lines. Supervisors are increasingly recognizing that the underlying risk characteristics of a financial instrument  activity or business line are of primary importance and not what they are called or officially labelled. To be sure  financial engineering can create derivative instruments which can combine component risks (including market  credit  liquidity  operational and reputational risks) in complex ways. But seemingly simple traditional cash instruments can actually have higher risk profiles than many instruments that are formally labelled “derivatives.” In fact  the categorization of financial instruments and activities without regard to their underlying risk and economic functions can actually handicap sound management. BIS Review 105/1997 - 2 - Thus  Federal Reserve and other supervisors have increasingly issued supervisory guidance that emphasizes managing the risks involved in bank activities and de-emphasizes the supervisory focus on specific instruments or traditional products. Most recently  the FFIEC published for industry comment a new policy statement that would eliminate the 1992 interagency policy that instituted the FFIEC high risk test. The older policy statement placed significant constraints on a depository institution’s holding of certain “high-risk” mortgage securities that met specific market risk sensitivity tests. The new policy would replace the high risk test with broader guidance on sound practices for managing all investment and end-user activities. In essence  the new statement would allow an institution to hold any bank-eligible instrument as an investment as long as the institution had an adequate risk management process commensurate with the scope  complexity  and sophistication of its investment and end-user holdings. The old FFIEC high-risk tests offer an excellent case study of the potential pitfalls of narrow formulaic supervision in an age of dynamic financial engineering. By requiring a pre-purchase price sensitivity analysis  the high risk test successfully helped institutions better understand the interest rate risk of certain mortgage securities. It effectively constrained many smaller financial institutions from acquiring certain types of securities that subsequently created large losses for other investors. However  while protecting some institutions  the tests may also have distorted the investment decision making process at other depository institutions. Concerns about burden and heightened examiner review of all types of mortgage securities may have led institutions to blindly eliminate them as potential investments -- regardless of the merits of their risk/return profiles. Also  by focusing only on certain products  the test provided incentives for institutions to acquire other types of securities with embedded options that required no testing. Such instruments were thought to have a supervisory “stamp of approval”  but in fact often had risk characteristics similar to or greater than those designated as “high risk”. Assuming positive industry comments  the FFIEC hopes to implement the proposed new policy in early 1998. The comment period extends through November 17  and I encourage all of you to comment. I might mention that the new policy will apply to all investment and end-user derivatives activities. It illustrates that supervisors are increasingly emphasizing risk management on a portfolio rather than an instrument-specific basis. Although this is arguably the first principle of finance and is widely appreciated by bankers and regulators  putting this principle into practice in banking has not been easy. Past banking crises have  in part  reflected a failure to recognize or to prudently limit concentrations of risk. However  technology and financial innovation are now enabling financial theories and conceptual techniques that have been around for decades to be put into practice to manage market  credit and liquidity risks. Moreover  these risks are increasingly being managed across activities and in some cases on a global basis. This move to a broad portfolio or “macro” approach to managing risk has influenced bank supervisory efforts in several ways. All three of the U.S. banking agencies now take a more “risk-focused” approach to bank supervision. Bank exams are no longer exhaustive reviews of all of a bank’s specific activities. Instead  they now take a more targeted approach to identifying and reviewing the sources of risk within a bank’s “portfolio” of activities. Exam resources are now targeted at evaluating the soundness of a bank’s processes for managing risks and our supervisory tools have been enhanced in this direction. Increased Use of Internal Measurement and Management Systems In addition  supervisors increasingly are relying on internal risk management systems  including increasingly sophisticated risk measurement systems used by banks to manage their businesses. BIS Review 105/1997 - 3 - The objectives here are two-fold -- to help improve the effectiveness of our examinations and to reduce the burden on banking organizations. Examinations now involve significant off-site  pre-planning  analysis and fact finding. Then the on-site examination activities include spot checks to determine the reliability of the bank’s internal risk management system. To the extent examiners gain confidence in the bank’s risk management process  they will place greater emphasis on the findings of the bank’s internal auditors at an earlier stage in the examination process and focus resources in other areas. An area of bank risk management systems that has been particularly useful to supervisors is risk measurement. No better example exists than the banking agencies’ adoption of a risk assessment approach for evaluating capital adequacy for interest rate risk. Early on in that rulemaking process  supervisors recognized that a number of banking institutions had internal models for measuring interest rate risk that were much more sophisticated than any possible standardized regulatory model. However  at the same time  supervisors were acutely aware that many other institutions had limited capabilities in this area and that many banks may have been hesitant to develop more sophisticated internal measurement systems prior to the determination of a supervisory approach. Accordingly  in 1993  supervisors proposed to use the results of internal models for evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk exposure at individual institutions. While the rulemaking process was ultimately longer than desired  it did demonstrate the clear intent of supervisors to encourage and provide incentives for improvements in risk management and to take full advantage of such advances when possible. I think most banks would agree that the discovery process and comment periods supervisors convened from 1993 through 1995  and the ensuing dialogue  spurred significant industry development and refinement of interest rate risk models. A similar process evolved in developing the international capital standard for market risk in the trading activities of internationally active banks. Beginning next January  banks that meet certain qualitative and quantitative standards for risk management will calculate market risk capital charges for their trading activities on the basis of their own internal Value at Risk (VaR) measures. Here again  supervisors recognized early developments in the quantitative measurement of market risks  encouraged industry progress  and sought to build on the VaR concept when developing a supervisory approach. During the discovery and rulemaking process the supervisory attention paid to VaR techniques led to more robust modelling and has helped spread the use of VaR techniques worldwide. Moving forward  perhaps such supervisory/private sector synergies can be gained in other areas of risk management  as well. The quantification of credit risks  by far the most important risk in banking  may be a candidate. At present  some institutions are making significant strides on a number of fronts to better quantify and manage credit risk. In addition to major developments in credit scoring and the use of artificial intelligence in underwriting various types of consumer loans  a few banks are beginning to use historical data to estimate probability loss distributions for the credit risk of different quality commercial loans. In some banks  credit risk-adjusted returns to capital are being used to construct a portfolio management framework for credit risk. This  in turn  is providing a proving ground for a risk-adjusted pricing of loans as well as a myriad of new instruments such as credit derivatives. While industry efforts to quantify credit risks are still in the early stages of evolution  recent progress holds promise for reducing both institutional and systemic risks. Indeed  these efforts might eventually lead to new supervisory regimes for addressing credit risk. Better methods of quantifying credit risk have significant potential for reducing the time examiners spend in on-site examinations. Moreover  advances in credit risk measurement may ultimately allow supervisors to design regulatory capital standards around internal models. We recognize the inadequacy of the existing risk-based capital regime where such assets as loans are all treated as having the same risk. We are actively encouraging the development of more quantitative approaches to credit risk management. However  better regulatory tools are not yet available. While supervisors can prod BIS Review 105/1997 - 4 - developments in risk management  ultimately it will be up to the industry to find other ways to better measure and manage credit risk. Strengthening Market Discipline Harnessing market forces to reinforce supervisory objectives is another important goal in the changing culture of supervisors. Reliable financial information and adequate disclosure of risk exposures is an essential ingredient to achieving this goal. Market participants can benefit from enhanced disclosure by being in a better position to understand the financial condition of counterparties and competitors. Investors have an obvious interest in being able to make meaningful assessments of a firm’s performance  underlying trends  and income-producing potential. Sound  well-managed firms can benefit if better disclosure enables them to obtain funds at risk premiums that accurately reflect lower risk profiles. Inadequate financial disclosures  on the other hand  could penalize well-managed firms if market participants are unable to assess fundamental financial strength. It is this desire to see market discipline play a greater role in influencing banking activities that has prompted the Federal Reserve Board to join the debate about the derivative accounting standards that are being developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Everyone agrees that a critical function of financial statements is to reflect in a meaningful way underlying trends in the financial performance and condition of the firm as well as the economic substance of its activities. However  the Board believes that the application of market value accounting to business strategies where not appropriate  and particularly when applied on a piecemeal basis  or when market prices are not readily available  may lead to increased volatility or fluctuation in reported results. Such accounting practices may actually obscure underlying trends or developments affecting a firm’s condition and performance. Requiring companies to adopt market value accounting where it is not consistent with business strategies can cause them to incur significant costs to provide information that may not realistically reflect way underlying circumstances or trends in performance. Moreover  from the standpoint of financial statement analysts and other users  having to make adjustments to remove the effects of meaningless accounting volatility from income statements and balance sheets can also impose significant costs without offsetting benefits. The Board believes that these problems can be minimized by having large firms with active trading portfolios place market values in supplemental disclosures rather than by forcing their use in the primary financial statements. Such an approach would give analysts the information they need  without imposing costs on an unnecessarily wide range of firms and without imposing the broader costs of having to reverse or “back out” the distorting effects of the proposed accounting standard. Emerging Challenges to Risk Management Without a doubt  banking institutions have made significant progress in implementing new techniques and methods in risk management. To date  most work in this area has centered around the “science” of risk management -- that is  the quantitative measurement of risk. However  quantitative measurement is only one element of the overall process of financial risk management. Other elements such as board and senior management oversight  internal controls  and the role of internal and external audits are just as important. Given the pace of technological and financial innovation  inadequate internal controls can expose an institution to significant risk. Indeed  inadequate management oversight  combined with a lack of internal controls  has been the primary cause of the losses experienced by several high profile major international banking organizations. In some cases basic time-honored internal controls such as segmentation of duties and independent risk assessment had been ignored. In others  internal management processes have failed to keep pace with technological development  financial innovation  and global expansion. It is these “low tech” areas that pose continued challenges to risk management. BIS Review 105/1997 - 5 - Some institutions are beginning to address these challenges in their attempts to identify  monitor and control the operating risks of various business lines. Indeed  operating risk is quickly emerging as the next frontier of risk management. While no clear standardized definition of operating risk has yet emerged  several progressive institutions are expending significant resources to address the operating risks inherent in particular business lines. For some  this involves conducting extensive risk assessments throughout business and product lines to identify both the types of processing  information  and personnel risks that exist and the potential measures that can be taken to mitigate them. Others are buttressing these assessments with attempts actually to quantify and charge internal capital for operating risk exposures. Supervisors can also be expected to more closely monitor banks’ efforts to identify and manage operating risks. One very important operating risk that all banking institutions face is the challenge of addressing the Year 2000 issue. U.S. banks appear to be taking this matter seriously and are generally well underway toward identifying individual needs and developing action plans. The Federal Reserve and the other federal bank supervisors are reviewing the relevant efforts of every insured depository institution in order to determine whether adequate progress on this issue is being made. Meeting the demands of this review and ensuring proper remedies both before and after the Year 2000 will be a significant and costly task to both the industry and the banking agencies. However  even within the context of banking  the scope of the Year 2000 problem extends far beyond U.S. banks to foreign banks  bank borrowers  depositors  vendors  and other counterparties. Banks and others need to address Year 2000 system alterations  not only because of the potential effects on overall markets  but also as a threat to individual firm viability. At a minimum  banks should be concerned about their ability to provide uninterrupted service to their customers into the next millennium. If nothing else  it is simply good business. Summary In summary  advances in computerization and communications have created a paradigm shift for financial markets  the financial services industry  and the management of financial risks. In response  supervisors are also moving to a new  more “incentive-compatible” regime of greater reliance on banks’ own risk measures and internal controls. This transformation may be slow and will be challenging for all. Supervisors can encourage innovation  but the private sector must do much of the development work. As always  a transition to an improved framework will work best with cooperative  open dialogue between the financial industry and its regulators  so that compatible and efficient answers are found. In today’s markets  institutions and financial systems are linked as never before  and such connections are likely to grow in the years ahead. How effectively institutions manage their risks and allocate their capital will have substantial consequences for economic growth. We have seen significant progress in measuring market risk  and the groundwork is being laid for future gains in measuring credit risk  but those are only two risks. Operating risks such as fraud  human misjudgments  and the failure of information systems  processing operations and basic internal controls must be addressed comprehensively. At this point  we can take satisfaction in the risk management strides we have made. But I am confident that opportunities for even greater progress lie ahead. BIS Review 105/1997

Recent developments in world finance have highlighted growing interactions among national financial markets. The underlying technology-based structure of the international financial system has enabled us to improve materially the efficiency of the flows of capital and payment systems. That improvement  however  has also enhanced the ability of the financial system to transmit problems in one part of the globe to another quite rapidly. Doubtless  there is much to be learned from the recent experience in Asia that can be applied to better the workings of the international financial system and its support of international trade that has done so much to enhance living standards worldwide. While each of the Asian economies differs in many important respects  the sources of their spectacular growth in recent years  in some cases decades  and the problems that have emerged are relevant to a greater or lesser extent to nearly all of them. Following the early post-World War II period  policies generally fostering low levels of inflation and openness of their economies coupled with high savings and investment rates contributed to a sustained period of rapid growth  in some cases starting in 1960s and 1970s. By the 1980s most economies in the region were expanding vigorously. Foreign net capital inflows grew  but until recent years were relatively modest. The World Bank estimates that net inflows of long-term debt  foreign direct investment  and equity purchases to the Asia Pacific region were only about $25 billion in 1990  but exploded to more than $110 billion by 1996. A major impetus behind this rapid expansion was the global stock market boom of the 1990s. As that boom progressed  investors in many industrial countries found themselves more heavily concentrated in the recently higher valued securities of companies in the developed world  whose rates of return  in many instances  had fallen to levels perceived as uncompetitive with the earnings potential in emerging economies  especially in Asia. The resultant diversification induced a sharp increase in capital flows into those economies. To a large extent  they came from investors in the United States and Western Europe. A substantial amount came from Japan  as well  owing more to a search for higher yields than to rising stock prices and capital gains in that country. The rising yen through mid-1995 also encouraged a substantial increase in direct investment inflows from Japan. In retrospect  it is clear that more investment monies flowed into these economies than could be profitably employed at modest risk. I suspect that it was inevitable in those conditions of low inflation  rapid growth  andample liquidity that much investment moved into the real estate sector  with an emphasis by both the public and private sectors on conspicuous construction projects. This is an experience  of course  not unknown in the United States on occasion. These real estate assets  in turn  ended up as collateral for a significant proportion of the assets of domestic financial systems. In many instances  those financial systems were less than robust  beset with problems of lax lending standards  weak supervisory regimes  and inadequate capital. Moreover  in most cases  the currencies of these economies were closely tied to the U.S. dollar  and the dollar’s substantial recovery since mid-1995  especially relative to the yen  made their exports less competitive. In addition  in some cases  the glut of semiconductors in 1996 suppressed export growth  exerting further pressures on highly leveraged businesses. However  overall GDP growth rates generally edged off only slightly  and imports  fostered by rising real exchange rates  continued to expand  contributing to what became unsustainable current account deficits in a number of these economies. Moreover  with exchange rates seeming to be solidly tied to the dollar  and with dollar and yen interest rates lower than domestic currency rates  a significant part of the enlarged capital inflows into these economies  in particular short-term flows  was BIS Review 105/1997 - 2 - denominated by the ultimate borrowers in foreign currencies. This put additional pressure on companies to earn foreign exchange through exports. The pressures on fixed exchange rate regimes mounted as foreign investors slowed the pace of new capital inflows  and domestic businesses sought increasingly to convert domestic currencies into foreign currencies  or  equivalently  slowed the conversion of export earnings into domestic currencies. The shifts in perceived future investment risks led to sharp declines in stock markets across Asia  often on top of earlier declines or lackluster performances. To date  the direct impact of these developments on the American economy has been modest  but it can be expected not to be negligible. U.S. exports to Thailand  the Philippines  Indonesia  and Malaysia (the four countries initially affected) were about 4 percent of total U.S. exports in 1996. However  an additional 12 percent went to Hong Kong  Korea  Singapore and Taiwan (economies that have been affected more recently). Thus  depending on the extent of the inevitable slowdown in growth in this area of the world  the growth of our exports will tend to be muted. Our direct foreign investment in  and foreign affiliate earnings reported from  the economies in this region as a whole have been a smaller share of the respective totals than their share of our exports. The share is  nonetheless  large enough to expect some drop-off in those earnings in the period ahead. In addition  there will be indirect effects on the U.S. real economy from countries such as Japan that compete even more extensively with the economies in the Asian region. Particularly troublesome over the past several months has been the so-called contagion effect of weakness in one economy spreading to others as investors perceive  rightly or wrongly  similar vulnerabilities. Even economies  such as Hong Kong  with formidable stocks of international reserves  balanced external accounts  and relatively robust financial systems  have experienced severe pressures. One can debate whether the turbulence in Latin American asset values reflects contagion effects from Asia  the influence of developments in U.S. financial markets  or home-grown causes. Whatever the answer  and the answer may be all of the above  this phenomenon illustrates the interdependencies in today’s world economy and financial system. Perhaps it was inevitable that the impressive and rapid growth experienced by the economies in the Asian region would run into a temporary slowdown or pause. But there is no reason that above-average growth in countries that are still in a position to gain from catching up with the prevailing technology cannot persist for a very long time. Nevertheless  rapidly developing  free-market economies periodically can be expected to run into difficulties because investment mistakes are inevitable in any dynamic economy. Private capital flows may temporarily turn adverse. In these circumstances  companies should be allowed to default  private investors should take their losses  and government policies should be directed toward laying the macroeconomic and structural foundations for renewed expansion; new growth opportunities must be allowed to emerge. Similarly  in providing any international financial assistance  we need to be mindful of the desirability of minimizing the impression that international authorities stand ready to guarantee the external liabilities of sovereign governments or failed domestic businesses. To do otherwise could lead to distorted investments and could ultimately unbalance the world financial system. The recent experience in Asia underscores the importance of financially sound domestic banking and other associated financial institutions. While the current turmoil has significant interaction with the international financial system  the recent crises would arguably have been better contained if long-maturity property loans had not accentuated the usual mismatch between maturities of assets and liabilities of domestic financial systems that were far from robust to begin with. Our unlamented savings and loan crises come to mind. These are trying days for economic policymakers in Asia. They must fend off domestic pressures that seek disengagement from the world trading and financial system. The authorities in these countries are working hard  in some cases with substantial assistance from the IMF  the World Bank  and the Asian Development Bank  to stabilize their financial systems and economies. BIS Review 105/1997 - 3 - The financial disturbances that have afflicted a number of currencies in Asia do not at this point  as I indicated earlier  threaten prosperity in this country  but we need to work closely with their leaders and the international financial community to assure that their situations stabilize. It is in the interest of the United States and other nations around the world to encourage appropriate policy adjustments  and where required  provide temporary financial assistance.

The EMU will be the most important change in the international monetary system since the creation of the IMF at Bretton Woods. The creation of a new currency  the Euro  is in fact a historical event for the European Union (EU). It marks a new quality in the process of European unification because it is the final point and coronation of efforts since 1958 to create one big market in Europe. The success of the Euro area will  of course  depend on the future development of the value of the Euro. The Euro  as we all know  has to compete with two strong international currencies: the US dollar and the Japanese yen. According to one school of thought  the Euro will have a stable value. That is because the high stock of assets in Euro  held by official or private foreign holders and which were converted from national currencies  in particular from Deutsche Mark  will not be switched into other currencies. Besides  once the Euro is introduced  there could be a significant switch of foreign exchange reserves out of US dollars and into Euro. This could give a boost to the exchange rate of the Euro against the US dollar over time. The sheer size of the economy in the monetary union will encourage the use of the Euro instead of the US dollar in trade and foreign exchange transactions. This process would further be accelerated by the fact that the use of a single currency will remove the not negligible cost of transactions. According to a study conducted by the IFO Institute in Munich  “the transaction costs for the inter-European currency management may be in the order of nearly 60 billion ECUs  or nearly 1% the GNP of the European Union”. Also it is likely that central banks will use the Euro rather than the US dollar in foreign exchange interventions. In turn  this will encourage non-EU central banks to switch an increasing proportion of their reserves into the Euro. This process will take time and the Euro will not usurp the role of the US dollar in the short term. However  the trend is likely to be persistent and eventually the current importance of the US dollar in the foreign exchange markets should be replaced by the joint importance of the US dollar and the Euro. One factor which will affect the speed of this change is the outlook for the Euro based on the fundamentals of the monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB). Moreover  the creation of a monetary union will prevent exchange rate volatility within the united Europe  the reason being that the Euro area as a whole will be much less dependent on foreign trade. It is estimated that the share of foreign trade of the Euro area will be only about 10% of GNP in comparison to about 30% for Germany today. And over the long term  the Euro should become almost as widely used as the US dollar is today. One conclusion to be inferred from this is the following: since Turkey has close trade  service and financial links with Europe  and as the only country connected to Europe in a Customs Union (CU)  which I hope will evolve over time towards full membership  the EMU will create completely new conditions in Turkey’s international and European relations. Therefore what will happen in Europe will be decisive for Turkey in the years ahead. It will be a challenge for the Turkish authorities  as well as for bankers and businessmen. One of the most important prerequisites for a successful monetary union is a sufficient degree of economic convergence among the potential members. From that standpoint the degree of convergence among the EU countries is remarkable  particularly as regards the convergence criteria; stable prices  stable exchange rates  low long-term interest rates and healthy public finances. In addition to these criteria  the Maastricht Treaty requires that all member countries in the EU must grant independence to their central banks before the Monetary Union and the establishment of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). The reason behind the requirement of independent national central banks is that fixing exchange rates and unifying currencies requires a common monetary policy. BIS Review 105/1997 - 2 - For a currency union to function “smoothly and in a sustainable way  it is absolutely necessary that all participants agree on either a single common policy or closely coordinated policies”. All costs and benefits of the union must be shared equally. Any member acting with the “free-rider” mentality  and benefiting from the system at the expense of the others  will eventually cause the system to disintegrate. Therefore  a single common currency requires a single monetary policy with a clearly defined target  which is price stability. This basic principle of monetary policy has already been embedded in the Maastricht Treaty. And the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) has been made responsible for achieving it. In order for the ESCB to fulfil the task assigned to it  it must act in full independence from national governments or from European institutions. The ESCB Governing Council  which is composed of the Board of Management of the ESCB and the governors of the participating central banks  will not be representing respective national interests. Although there are some differences between the two systems  the ESCB is like the Federal Reserve System of the US. For the ESCB to act independently  individual national central banks must already be acting independently of their governments  because the ESCB will be built on individual national central banks. That is why the Maastricht Treaty made it obligatory for the national governments to grant independence to their central banks in the period leading to the formation of the ESCB. The EMU is an event with far-reaching consequences; in one way or the other all countries will be affected by it. Unlike the effect of a currency area  a customs union or a free trade area  a monetary union can affect in various degrees all countries  irrespective of whether they are in or out. This general fact  together with the signing a Customs Union (CU) Agreement with the EU  make EMU even more important for Turkey than for other countries outside the EMU. Therefore  I believe that the Turkish Central Bank has a predominant role to play in informing and educating all Turkish entities about the choices and implications of EMU. As you all know  Turkey is one of the potential countries to join the EU. I would say that our country’s ultimate aim is to become a full member of the EU; therefore first we need to adapt to European standards in many areas. The steps Turkey took on the way to the CU are also steps taken to ensure full integration in EMU. After these general remarks I would like to look at the issue from Turkey’s perspective. So far  the measures taken to support the independence of the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) are remarkable. Recently  the Central Bank Law was amended and now limits have been set on the so-called “short-term advances” which the Treasury is legally entitled to obtain from the Central Bank. Starting from 1994  the Treasury’s annual use of short-term advances is to be reduced gradually over five years from 15 to 3 percent of each year’s incremental budget appropriations. By 1998  the Treasury will be entitled to short-term advances totalling not more than 3 percent of that year’s incremental budget appropriations over the previous year. In addition to that  the Treasury and the Central Bank have signed a seven-point protocol to cooperate in fighting inflation. The official aim of this accord is also to give the Central Bank more independence. So  an important development towards the full independence of the Central Bank has been initiated  as required in the Maastricht Treaty. However  we have been in the process of preparing a new Central Bank law in parallel with the same institutions in the EU. The work has already been done and we are ready to submit it to the government if and when the political environment is appropriate. On the other hand  in addition to the already installed electronic payments clearing system  the CB has signed a contract to develop and install a modern national securities settlement system. The new system will allow the Bank to increase the efficiency with which government securities can be traded on the capital markets and ensure that the payments system will match the standards of those in the EU and other western nations. The new system will also be capable of being connected to the BIS Review 105/1997 - 3 - TARGET network. At the same time the system will strengthen Turkey’s links with the European member countries and will enable it to trade in the same currency as other members  a requirement for participation in the EMU. As far as the technical infrastructure is concerned  Turkey is ready to integrate itself into the EU. I would like to remind you that Turkey has been pursuing a series of liberalization policies since 1980 which are broadly in line with economic tendencies in the world. A wide range of policy measures were put into effect to achieve the restructuring of the economy. Changes in exchange rate and trade policies were the main instruments in this process. This program has brought a radical change in Turkey’s development strategy by increasing its dependence on market forces. In this context  the fixed exchange rate policy was replaced by the flexible one  restrictive control measures on imports were abolished and protection was reduced gradually. Similarly  foreign exchange transactions were thoroughly liberalized  free trade zones were established  foreign investment was further encouraged along with the privatization of public enterprises. As a result of these newly adopted policies  there have been spectacular changes in the Turkish economy  with exports and foreign investments having proved to be responsive to the structural adjustment process; within this process  the Turkish lira has become fully convertible and restrictions on capital movements have been effectively removed. Even though the liberalization policies were adopted independent of the EU perspective  they helped to facilitate Turkey’s attempt to apply for full membership  by providing a solid basis for lasting progress. On the other hand  member countries of the EU have tried to make some adaptations in their banking regulations to integrate financial systems. Competition among them has increased. A universal banking system is accepted. Banks either have increased their assets or have merged with other banks in order to be strong in a market where competition is intensified. New financial products are created every day. Technology is used intensively in order to reduce costs and serve customers better. In parallel to these developments many reforms have been made in order to develop the Turkish banking system. Some amendments were made to the Banking Law to harmonize it with European standards  and now we are in the process of preparing a new Banking Law. These changes will require some banks to strengthen their financial situation and bring their credit risk and equity participation ratios closer to the EU norms. Within the process of becoming more deeply integrated with the European financial markets  the Turkish banking system will now face new competition. The CU agreement has naturally affected Turkish banks and changed the dimensions of competition. But Turkish banks seem ready in many ways for this new and larger competitive environment. Today banks in Turkey are made more dynamic by a high-technology electronic infrastructure  high-quality services and well-trained manpower. What we need is to integrate the legal and institutional systems in parallel with the EU banks. With the introduction of the Euro there would arise a number of technical issues which must be immediately tackled. As of today  Turkish banks are allowed to maintain foreign exchange positions in 23 foreign currencies  of which 17  including the ECU  are European currencies. With the Euro the CB and the Turkish banks will no longer have to deal in these currencies  but only in Euro. Of course  initially there will be some currencies  like the British pound and a few others  which will continue to exist for a while. But within this process  all foreign assets and liabilities in the currencies of the countries participating in the monetary union will need to be converted into the Euro. Currently  Turkey follows an exchange rate policy based on a basket consisting of the US dollar and the Deutsche Mark. It is assumed that since other European currencies are related to the Deutsche Mark through the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM)  the basket also reflects the weight of other European currencies through the Deutsche Mark. With monetary union the share of the Euro area in Turkey’s overall trade in goods or services will be more than 50%. But this will not change the picture from the exchange rate policy point of view. Therefore the Euro could easily be substitute for Deutsche Mark in the present basket. BIS Review 105/1997 - 4 - Within the CB’s foreign reserves  some positions are being held in the currencies of the countries which are candidates for monetary union membership. These positions consist of securities and money market placements. It is expected that security investments will be converted to the Euro as of January 1st  1999. Money market placements on the other hand will continue to be transacted in their original currencies until July 1st  2002. The fixing of the Deutsche Mark rate against Euro  the Euro’s value against other currencies in the international money markets and the depth and performance of the Euro bond market will be important factors in terms of our reserve management policy. In the Euro market  there will no longer be any cross-currency risk and cross currency-induced interest rate differential. However  it is possible that the country risk-induced differential will become more pronounced. Therefore investors must pay attention to which country’s security they are buying when investing in Euro-denominated securities. There are also issues which should be considered by the real sector. In particular those firms which are very active in trades across borders are likely to adopt the value of the Euro in their dealings rather quickly  because firms competing in European markets  in order to make comparison possible  should set their prices in Euro. As I have already mentioned  the CB and the commercial banks have to convert the foreign exchange denominated accounts into the Euro. This is not an easy task and involves changes in accounting systems and data processing. Therefore due attention has to be paid to these infrastructural changes prior to the introduction of the Euro. The fact that the EU is Turkey’s most important trading partner increases the implications of EMU for the Turkish economy. On the other hand  the EU has the largest share in foreign investment in Turkey  and invisible earnings in the Turkish balance of payments have a significant European content. Furthermore  most of our correspondent banks are in the Euro zone. Turkey has close trade  service and financial links with Europe  as the only country connected to Europe in a CU which hopefully will evolve over time towards full membership. In conclusion  I would like to point out that time is getting short for launching the Euro. The time remaining must therefore be used efficiently. Those who have prepared and are ready will also be those who will also derive the greatest benefits. I do believe that we are heading in the right direction. BIS Review 105/1997

Introduction In the implementation of monetary policy the Reserve Bank should not be influenced by the fact that an election will take place in South Africa in May 1999. The reference to the “pre- and post-election period” in the title of this address should therefore be regarded as coincidental. As always  monetary policy should be guided by developments in financial aggregates such as the money supply and In contemporary monetary policy  central banks are normally also not guided by the objective of “stabilising the business cycle”. It is the task of monetary policy to promote a stable financial environment at all times  irrespective of the current phase of the business cycle. There is  however  a definite relationship between developments in real economic activity (“the business cycle”) and in the financial aggregates relevant for monetary policy. By concentrating on the trends in the financial aggregates  and not in real economic activity  monetary policy  however  has a better chance of maintaining financial stability that will  in the longer term  be conducive for sustainable economic growth at a higher level. A former Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia once said the following: “There was a recognition that (monetary) policy had to do more than stabilise the cycle: the problem with an exclusive focus on the business cycle was that we may well stabilise the real side of the economy without stabilising the price side of the economy”. (Governor M.J. Phillips  When the Music Stops  Reserve Bank of Australia Bulletin  July 1990). A slowdown in the business cycle will normally also include a slowdown in real gross domestic expenditure  incorporating declines in the growth rates of both consumption and investment expenditure. Such slowdowns  however  may not yet at the time of the decline in expenditure justify the relaxation of monetary policy. The slowdown in real expenditure will after some normal time-lags be followed by a decrease in the demand for bank credit  which will also lead to a decline in the rate of growth in the money supply. Timing monetary policy decisions to coincide rather with changes in the monetary aggregates and not with changes in real economic activity reduces the danger of a premature re-stimulation of the demand for bank credit  and a too early injection of excessive amounts of additional money. A monetary policy linked to changes in the business cycle could easily lead to the re-emergence of the harmful stop-go policies so often pursued by central banks in the 1960s. 2. 1997 - A year of macroeconomic consolidation Developments in the South African economy in the early months of 1996  and particularly the currency crisis of February last year  exposed certain weaknesses that were developing in the South African economy at that time  and that needed early correction. The signs were already there in the first half of 1996 that the calendar year of 1997 would turn out to be a year of macroeconomic consolidation. Now  eighteen months later  we can look back with some satisfaction on the progress that has been made in restoring overall economic equilibrium. Firstly  in the area of real economic activity  equilibrium has been restored not only in the growth rates but also in the absolute levels of total gross BIS Review 106/1997 - 2 - domestic product and total gross domestic expenditure. After increases of about 6 per cent per year in 1994 and 1995  the growth in gross domestic expenditure slowed down to 3 per cent in 1996  and to almost zero so far in 1997. The rate of growth in total production also slowed down marginally  but was still maintained at a positive level of about 2 per cent in the first nine months of 1997. These developments in real economic activity over the past eighteen months were reflected in an improvement in the overall balance of payments. The seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of the current account deficit declined from R13 billion in the second quarter of 1996 to R3½ billion in the second quarter of 1997. This improvement contributed to the adoption of a more positive attitude by foreign investors and the net capital inflow increased from less than R4 billion in the full year of 1996 to more than R16 billion in the first half of 1997. In light of the surplus that emerged on the overall balance of payments  the total gross gold and foreign exchange reserves held by the banking sector increased by R14 billion from about R17 billion at the end of December 1996 to about R31 billion at the end of June 1997. Thirdly  the excessive rates of increase in the money supply and in bank credit extension in 1995 and 1996 also marginally slowed down in 1997. In the third quarter of 1997  the seasonally adjusted amount of the money supply increased at an annual rate of 12.2 per cent  and that of total domestic credit extension by the banking sector by only 6.3 per cent. Finally  in the consolidation process  South Africa succeeded in absorbing the unavoidable increase in inflation in the aftermath of the depreciation of last year. As was expected  the rate of increase in consumer prices accelerated from 5.5 per cent in April 1996 to 9.9 per cent in April 1997 but then declined again to 8 per cent in September 1997. In the third quarter of 1997  inflation was indeed running at an annualised rate of 6.6 per cent  back on track again towards the medium-term objective of bringing the rate of inflation in South Africa more in line with the average rate of inflation in the economies of our major international trading partners and competitors. The parts played by changes in the exchange rate of the rand  and in interest rates  in bringing about better equilibrium should not be underestimated. The average weighted value of the rand against a basket of currencies first depreciated by about 23 per cent during the first ten months of last year  before it appreciated again by 11 per cent from 31 October 1996 to 13 March 1997. Since then it followed a more steady path and depreciated by about 10 per cent in the next seven months. At the end of October 1997  the average weighted value of the rand was only marginally down from its level of 31 December 1996. Liquidity was initially drained from the money market after the foreign capital inflows subsided in February 1996  and the money market shortage gradually increased to reach a peak of more than R10 billion in March 1997. Since then  the situation eased again to an average daily shortage of only about R5 billion in October 1997. Interest rates obviously followed these trends and increased quite sharply during the course of 1996 but then declined again in 1997. The rate on three months bankers’ acceptances for example reached a peak of almost 17 per cent at the end of November 1996  before declining to 14.9 per cent at the end of October 1997. The macroeconomic consolidation process therefore without any doubt created a sounder and better balanced overall economic basis on which a next phase of more rapid economic expansion can now develop. 3. The role of monetary policy After the exchange rate crash of February 1996  the monetary policy approach was to let market forces work with some intervention by the Reserve Bank in the foreign exchange and in the money markets  but mainly with the intention of supporting an orderly adjustment in market prices. It BIS Review 106/1997 - 3 - was never the intention to try and fix the exchange rate of the rand at any predetermined artificial level  neither did the Bank try to keep interest rates unrealistically low. It was furthermore accepted that  after the relatively large depreciation in the exchange rate and taking account also of the “openness” of the South African economy  the rate of inflation would rise. The challenge for monetary policy was  however  to constrain the rate of increase in inflation to a first round effect only  and to prevent prices from going into an uncontrollable and perpetuating inflationary spiral. In retrospect  the policy seemed to have worked quite well. The restrictive monetary policy  and particularly the rise in interest rates  were not received with unanimous support by all sectors of the South African community. Interest rates  however  remain one of the main disciplines of the market economy and countries that are not prepared to bear the effects of this discipline from time to time will be punished by the markets. This basic lesson is now being learned again by a number of countries in the East Asia region where interest rates recently soared to a much higher level than ever experienced by South Africa. Now that the overall macroeconomic consolidation process has made good progress  there are some impatient pressures building up on the Reserve Bank to relax monetary policy quickly and decisively. Some of these pressures are still based on the now defunct Phillips curve or an assumed trade-off between inflation and growth -- an argument that was buried in most countries of the world already in the 1980s when macroeconomic policy switched the emphasis from a demand-management approach to a supply-side solution. The rapid expansion of communications and the increase in electronically driven capacity for economic analyses further contributed to the more effective implementation of pre-empting expectations  and reduced the opportunity for central bankers to stimulate economies in the short term by applying over-expansionary monetary policies. The South African Reserve Bank now follows the lead of many other central banks in the world to base monetary policy decisions on developments in financial or monetary aggregates  and not on changes in real economic activity. Indeed  the latest fashion is for central banks  together with governments  to target inflation more directly. Taking account of typical time-lags that exist between the implementation of monetary policies and their eventual effect on prices  monetary policy adjustments are based on the expectation of what the rate of inflation may turn out to be twelve to eighteen months downstream. Reliable forecasting therefore has become as important for the monetary authorities as they are for private sector operators in the markets. For this purpose  the familiar monetary aggregates such as the money supply  bank credit extension  the level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve and changes in the exchange rate provide the best indicators available in the short term to guide monetary policy decisions. What will be important for the stance of monetary policy over the next year will not be the approaching election in 1999  but rather current developments in these well-known basic financial aggregates. Apart from contending with the after-effects of the depreciation of the rand last year  the major concern for the Reserve Bank recently has been the continuous increase at a high rate in the total amount of bank credit extended to the private sector. Over the past few months there has been a significant slowdown in the annualised rate of increase in bank credit extended to the private sector which amounted to 21.2 per cent in the second quarter of 1997  before declining to 9.5 per cent in the third quarter. After the recent downward adjustment in the financial markets in South Africa  we may find some further slowdown in the rate of increase in bank credit extension  to reflect more truly the slowdown which already occurred in real economic activity. Recent events in the international currency markets proved once again that the forecasting of possible future developments in financial aggregates can be very perilous. As South Africa liberalises its financial markets further and as the South African financial system gets more integrated into an extremely volatile international environment  the hazards of forecasting will increase. For the central bank  this unfortunately reduces the value of strictly defined monetary policy models  and makes BIS Review 106/1997 - 4 - the task of implementing policies more discretionary. Market participants prefer a monetary policy based on pre-announced rules and want to be in a position where they can pre-empt important changes in monetary policy for their own advantage  and for the sake of giving good advice to their clients. This  however  is not possible in the present environment where unpredictable events in far-away places such as Thailand can have profound influences on monetary developments in South Africa. Forecasting possible developments in the exchange rate of the rand  for example  must not only take account of developments in South Africa  but also of possible changes in the cross exchange rates of major currencies  developments in international capital markets  economic and political developments in a number of emerging economies and a multitude of other possible global developments. As illustrated over the past year  changes in the effective exchange rate of the rand in turn can have many effects on monetary policy decisions in South Africa. In this multi-complex environment it is just unreasonable to expect of any governor of any central bank anywhere in the world to signal to markets in advance what adjustments in interest rates or other monetary policies could be expected over the next year. 4. A greater reliance on markets In the situation  it is advisable to rely more on market forces for the necessary correction of imbalances that may develop from time to time in the macro economy. Markets must therefore be encouraged to become more flexible  more efficient and more responsive to changes in underlying supply and demand conditions. In the case of South Africa  three important changes will be introduced in the structure of financial markets over the next few months: Firstly  the existing national payment  clearing and settlement system will be upgraded in March 1998 to pave the way for real-time on-line settlement of large transactions on a gross basis  and for the daily settlement on a net basis of other (smaller) transactions between banking institutions. This versatile new system will provide challenging opportunities for the development of a more active interbank funds market. Secondly  the Reserve Bank will introduce a new system for providing liquidity to banking institutions through daily repurchase transactions that will establish a floating interest rate for central bank accommodation. Thirdly  the Department of Finance intends to introduce a new system for the primary sale of and secondary market making in government bonds by the appointment of a number of securities dealers from the private banking sector to operate as authorised dealers on behalf of the Treasury. These changes are all intended to serve the needs of more liberalised and free financial markets in South Africa. At the same time  they should open up the way for further exchange control relaxations and encourage greater integration of the South African financial markets in the global financial system. 5. Concluding remarks Next year holds the prospects for being an interesting one for the South African economy. Firstly  there is the prospect for better economic growth in South Africa  following upon the macroeconomic consolidation of the past year. BIS Review 106/1997 - 5 - Secondly  important structural adjustments  particularly in the financial markets  will introduce interesting new challenges for all participants in the markets. Thirdly  we shall have to contend with the continuing turmoil in the international currency markets  and possibly also with the adverse effects of the El Nino phenomenon. BIS Review 106/1997

Prospects for the City -- in or out of EMU Mr. Chairman  you have asked me to speak specifically about “the prospects for the City - or out of EMU”. You -- very kindly in recent circumstances -- did not ask me to discuss the wider pros and cons  either of the project as a whole  or of UK membership. But perhaps I might nevertheless begin by making a more general point. Perfectly reasonable people can legitimately disagree about EMU  both in principle and about the appropriate timing and pace of monetary integration. On the project as a whole  most analysts would acknowledge that there are real potential benefits  but that there are also real risks to be set against them; and most would acknowledge that those risks will increase if the politics of EMU are allowed to run ahead of the economics  so that countries are allowed  or even encouraged  to participate  without first having achieved genuine  and sustainable  economic convergence -- in substance and not just some technical accounting form. On the question of British membership the new Labour Government has spoken of ‘formidable obstacles’ to this country joining EMU in the first wave. But one thing is clear: everyone  in or out  has an unambiguous interest  if EMU does go ahead  in doing everything we can to make it a success. And it is equally clear that those countries that participate in Monetary Union have a similar unambiguous interest in the economic prosperity of countries remaining  at least for the time being  on the outside. Larry Summers  the Deputy Secretary of the US Treasury  writing about EMU in the “The US is well served when Europe is vibrant economically and working to open its markets and strengthen its ties with the global economy.” He might have been speaking for all of us here in Europe  in or out  recognising that we have a mutual  and reciprocal  self-interest in each other’s economic well-being. So my general point is this. Whatever the outcome on EMU  it is vitally important that we continue to maintain  and strengthen  positive and constructive relationships throughout the European Union area -- and indeed beyond -- in For the UK  in particular  if we were to opt out of the first wave  that certainly means that during our EU Presidency  over the critical first half of next year  we must -- as I am quite confident we will -- do everything we possibly can to ensure that the procedures leading up to the historic decisions run smoothly and that the decisions themselves are timely and  hopefully  harmonious. But beyond that it certainly means  too  that “outs”  or potential “pre-ins”  should not attempt to exploit any perceived -- and certainly short-term -- advantage from the additional policy freedoms they might have on the outside  but should  for example  persist in macro-economic  fiscal and monetary  discipline in parallel with the EMU countries. But it also means that the “in” countries  for their part  have an identical self-interest in maintaining an open and constructive relationship with the “outs”/“pre-ins”. Otherwise we would all be cutting off our nose to spite our face. I make this general point  Mr. Chairman  because this context seems to me to be relevant to any assessment of the economic prospect  of the economy as a whole or of any particular sector  within or without the euro-area. In the rest of my remarks I assume that  in or out  we will be operating within a constructive  co-operative  environment throughout the EU  for the powerful reason that that is in everyone’s interest. BIS Review 106/1997 - 2 - Against that background let me turn to the prospects for the City. I will  in fact  concentrate on the case in which the UK does not participate in EMU in the first wave  because in the alternative case  the UK in scenario  while there may be uncertainty about the overall macro-economic implications  there is little reason to suppose that there would be any adverse implications for the City in particular. The only possible disadvantage I see would result from the imposition of onerous regulatory or financial burdens -- for example onerous minimum reserve requirements -- which might act to distort activity within the financial sector and/or drive it outside the euro-area altogether. So what then are the prospects for the City if the UK is  initially  out? The current strengths of the City -- as a uniquely international  rather than simply a national or regional European financial centre -- will be familiar to you. They include a vast  critical mass of markets and financial services in commercial and investment banking  securities and derivatives activity  investment and fund management  insurance and commodities and so on  involving an extraordinary concentration of the strongest financial businesses from all around the world. To give just one example  uniquely among the major countries we have more banks which are incorporated abroad operating in the City than domestic banks  and over half of the total deposits of the UK banking system is denominated twelve noughts -- notwithstanding the current strength of sterling. in foreign currencies  worth over £1 that’s a one and trillion -- The particular strengths that have contributed to this massive concentration of international business are many and various. They include: the English language; the convenient time zone; the ready availability of the relevant trading and other financial skills as well as professional support services -- in law  accountancy  tax  property  communications and so on. They include effective infrastructure. And they include importantly  too  an adaptive regulatory framework which has in fact been remarkably successful in maintaining confidence in financial institutions and markets without stifling innovation and risk-taking. All of these factors -- and no doubt others -- help to explain why some 600 000 people are estimated to be employed in finance and other business services in Greater London -- a number which I believe is roughly equal to the total population of Frankfurt. Now you will have noticed that none of these factors has anything to do with the question of the national currency used either here in the UK or in Continental Europe. The main impact of the advent of the euro on financial activity  as I see it  is that it will encourage the development of broader and deeper and more liquid markets  in financial instruments of all kinds  where they are currently fragmented because they are denominated in the various individual national European currencies. The City of London thrives on liquid markets regardless of the currency -- and it will thrive on the euro  whether the UK is “in” or “out”. Measured in these terms the introduction of the euro represents an opportunity for London rather than a threat. I have no doubt whatever that there will be a vigorous euro-euro market in London  come what may  just as there is a vigorous market in euro-DM or euro-francs as well as euro-$ and euro-yen at present. The reality is that the location of financial activity does not depend upon the local currency. It will continue to be carried on wherever it can most conveniently  efficiently and profitably be carried on. And the fact that foreign-owned institutions -- from Europe itself and from around the world -- continue to build their presence here  despite the near universal assumption that the UK will not in fact participate in EMU from the beginning  suggests that they share this perception. I would hope that the rest of Europe would positively welcome the contribution that the City can  and I am confident will  make to the development of markets and other financial activity in the euro  because it is in their interest too. International or intra-regional trade and investment activity is not  at the macro-economic level  a zero-sum game. It is a positive sum game. And this is true of financial  just as much as of any other kind of economic activity. The prosperity of the City -- whether the UK is “in” or “out” -- is simply a particular case of the general point which I made at the outset. I welcome the BIS Review 106/1997 - 3 - prospect of increasing financial activity in Frankfurt  Paris  Milan or Amsterdam or wherever because it will result in increased activity here too in London. And the converse is equally true. It is in this sense that the City is a major European  not simply a national asset. Now some people may argue that “offshore” markets in national or regional currencies complicate the conduct of national or regional monetary policy  with the implication that national or regional currencies should somehow be confined to their national or regional space. I must confess that this view seems to ignore the fact that it has in practice over the past twenty or thirty years proved perfectly possible for monetary policy to be conducted successfully despite the existence of the euro-markets. And I do not see how one could realistically expect to contain the use of a major currency  which the euro will certainly be  within territorial borders in any event. But as I have made clear  the UK’s interest -- “in” or “out” -- lies unambiguously in doing all that we can to ensure that the single currency succeeds. And in this context we would  of course  co-operate with the ECB in any way we could  to avoid potential disturbance to European monetary policy  were it shown to exist. Mr Chairman  London does not hold its pre-eminent position as Europe’s major financial centre as of right. We must continue to earn it. If we are to take advantage -- “in” or “out” -- of the opportunity that the euro will bring  then we must be technically well prepared. We will be. There is increasing evidence that financial institutions in the UK are now taking the steps necessary to ensure that they are ready for the introduction of the euro  whether or not the UK joins EMU. In the early summer  we invited a representative sample of firms to confirm whether their preparations were on track. The response we received was broadly reassuring  though some of their preparations are dependent on decisions about the euro markets which have yet to be taken  as I shall explain in a moment. But the key point is that the urgency of the need to prepare is now widely recognised. The Bank of England is playing a substantive role in the preparations in two complementary ways. Through our very active participation in the work of the EMI  we aim to make sure that the design of EMU  at least so far as the operations of the ECB are concerned  is capable of being delivered in a technical sense. That is the test that we have applied  for example  to the work of the EMI on the implementation of monetary policy and on the so-called changeover scenario. John Townend talked about this yesterday. Our other role is to co-ordinate the preparations for the introduction of the euro in the City of London  to the extent that co-ordination is required. The Bank’s role in helping the financial sector to prepare for the euro was recognised and reconfirmed by the Chancellor this summer when he launched his complementary initiative to begin preparing the business community for the euro. In addition to making our own internal preparations at the Bank  we play a co-ordinating role in the financial community in three main ways: First  our job is to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is developed in the UK to allow anyone who wishes to do so to use the euro in wholesale payments and across the financial markets in London from the first day of EMU. Second  we aim to promote discussion between the EMI  national central banks and market participants across Europe about practical issues on which the market is seeking a degree of co-ordination. And third  we provide information: for example  through our quarterly series of editions on Practical Issues Arising from the Introduction of the Euro  which is distributed to around 32 000 BIS Review 106/1997 - 4 - recipients across the City and beyond  including 4 000 directly abroad. And following the successful symposium we held early this year  we are planning to hold a further symposium  next January at the Bank  on London as the international financial centre for the euro. Our theme will be: ‘London will be ready’. I shall now turn to the steps that we are taking to ensure that London will be ready for the euro  whether the UK is “in” or “out”. (i) Payments and settlement infrastructure for the euro First of all  the payments and settlement infrastructure. We are constructing payments arrangements in euro in London which we intend to be at least as efficient and cheap as anywhere else in Europe  even if the UK stays “out”. In the UK  the real-time gross settlement system which came into operation in the spring of last year is being developed so that it will operate in euro. If the UK joins  the UK sterling system will effectively become a euro system. And  in case the UK is “out”  a parallel euro system is under construction to sit alongside the sterling system: it will enable the members of CHAPS to process euro payments as a foreign currency within the UK and across borders within the EU  through its link to the pan-European RTGS system -- TARGET -- which is being developed. The idea behind TARGET is to link together in euro the national RTGS systems of EU Member States so that large-value payments can be made or received between Member States throughout the EU area  with finality in real time  in exactly the same way as they can at present be made and received within Member States with national RTGS systems denominated in their own national currencies. One of the main purposes of TARGET is to support closer European economic and financial integration by reducing the risks in pan-European payments -- just as national RTGS systems reduce the risk in national payment systems. The other main purpose of TARGET is to integrate the euro money market so as to ensure that the same short term euro interest rate -- determined by the single monetary policy of the ECB -- prevails throughout the euro area. TARGET is a project which we strongly support. It has been agreed that all EU Member States may connect their national RTGS systems to TARGET  whether or not they join EMU. The main policy issue outstanding concerns the terms on which the European Central Bank will grant intraday credit to the “outs”. We see no monetary -- or other -- grounds for any discrimination against the “outs”. If intraday liquidity to the “outs” were to be restricted the effect would be to increase the cost of using TARGET  and to damage the efficiency of the system for both “ins” and “outs”. That would simply divert euro payments to alternative mechanisms  including correspondent banking and the EBA’s net end-of-day settlement system. It would be unlikely significantly to deter the international use of the euro -- if that were the objective -- any more than lack of direct access to national RTGS systems deters the international use of the dollar or yen or Deutsche Mark now. Its main impact would be to make intra-European payments less secure. We would regret that. Besides payments systems  the preparation of securities settlement systems for the introduction of the euro is a complex task in its own right. One of the reasons for this is that there are different approaches to securities settlement between different Member States and financial institutions. Another is that different approaches may be required to meet issuers’ requirements for re-denomination. Even in one market in one country  the introduction of major changes in securities settlement systems can lead to teething problems  both in the central IT infrastructure and for individual institutions as they learn how to apply the changes. Yet in the case of EMU  a number of Member States will switch to the euro more or less simultaneously at the start. That carries considerable risks of confusion and error  unless there is an extensive programme across Europe to explain the changes required in detail first. This is not of course  a particular problem for the UK. (ii) Market framework for the use of the euro BIS Review 106/1997 - 5 - The second important aspect of preparation is the development of a comprehensive market framework for the use of the euro in London. The euro regulations help to provide the legal part of the framework as I understand you discussed yesterday. To make sure that the euro market in London  as elsewhere in Europe  is as deep and liquid as possible  we also need to harmonise market conventions on new issues of securities in the euro money and bond markets  and conventions in the foreign exchange markets. Market associations now agree on the basis on which conventions in these markets should be harmonised  and the Bank has encouraged their initiative. The problem has been to see how EU-wide decisions will be taken. Harmonised practices may develop spontaneously in the markets  but there is no guarantee of this. So it is very helpful that the EMI Council decided with our encouragement in September to ‘welcome and support’ harmonised market conventions on the basis proposed by the market associations. We also welcome the EMI Council’s decision in September to prepare for the computation by the ESCB of an effective overnight reference rate for the euro area. There remains however a good deal to be done everywhere -- in co-ordinating price sources  for example  as methods of redenomination. But in all of these respects London is well up with the game. Conclusion Mr. Chairman  it is sometimes suggested that a perceived threat to its activity if we were “out” will cause the City to press for early UK membership of EMU  and that this will be an important factor in the Government’s decision. I am bound to say that I see very little sign of this. Certainly there are those in the City who advocate our early participation  but there are equally those who are more hesitant -- just as opinions are divided elsewhere within the country. But for the most part  my impression is that City attitudes to EMU  whether for or against  reflect a broader assessment of the respective pros and cons for the country as a whole rather than strong views about the implications for the City in particular. On the whole I find that City opinion is relatively optimistic about its future prospects  “in” or “out”. And  provided we do indeed operate within a co-operative framework  and provided we are indeed well prepared  the City has good reason to be optimistic. BIS Review 106/1997

The remarkable progress that has been made by virtually all of the major industrial countries in achieving low rates of inflation in recent years has brought into sharper focus the issue of price measurement. As we move closer to price stability  the necessity of measuring prices accurately has become an especial challenge. Biases of a few tenths in annual inflation rates do not matter when inflation is high. They do matter when  as now  a debate has emerged over whether our economies are moving toward price deflation. In today’s advanced economies  allocative decisions are primarily made not by governments but by markets  and the central guide to the efficient allocation of resources in a market economy is prices. Prices are the signals through which tastes and technology affect the decisions of consumers and producers  directing resources toward their highest valued use. Of course  this signaling process would work with or without government statistical agencies that measure individual and aggregate price levels  and in this sense  price measurement probably is not fundamental for the overall efficiency of the market economy. Indeed  vibrant market economies existed long before government agencies were established to measure prices. Nonetheless  in a modern monetary economy  accurate price measurement is of considerable importance  increasingly so for central banks whose mandate is to maintain financial stability. Accurate price measures are necessary for understanding economic developments  not only involving inflation but also involving real output and productivity. If the general price level is estimated to be rising more rapidly than is in fact the case  then we are simultaneously understating growth in real output and productivity. Real incomes and living standards are rising faster than our published data suggest. Under these circumstances  policymakers must be cognizant of the shortcomings of our published price indexes to avoid misguided actions that will provoke unintended consequences. Clearly  central bankers need to be conscious of the problems of price measurement as we gauge policies designed to promote price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth. Moreover  many economic transactions  both private and public  are explicitly tied to movements in some published price index  most commonly a consumer price index; and some transactions that are not explicitly tied to a published price index may nevertheless take such an index into account less formally. If the price index is not accurately measuring what the participants in such transactions believe it is measuring  then economic transactions will be skewed. The measured price indexes have played an especially prominent role in Germany  both in terms of public perceptions of inflation performance and as a guide for policymakers. The Bundesbank’s long-standing commitment to price stability and the public’s support for that commitment derive at least to some extent from Germany’s experiences with hyperinflation earlier this century. Given this experience with the devastation that such inflation can bring to the economy and to people’s lives  it comes as no surprise that your public and your policymakers give such careful scrutiny to the available measures of inflation. Germany has a reputation for special vigilance in guarding the stability of the price level and has achieved an admirable record of success in maintaining low inflation over the postwar period. From the standpoint of monetary policy  this very success makes accurate price measurement all the more important. When measured inflation is high  we can be confident that the proper direction of monetary policy is to bring inflation lower. But when measured inflation is low  the proper direction of monetary policy  as I indicated  could depend crucially on the accuracy of those measurements. The importance of accurate price measurement was particularly apparent during unification  when it became necessary to gauge productivity in East and West Germany on a comparable basis. Initial estimates of East German productivity relative to that of the West were considerably higher than later  more accurate estimates showed to be the case. These differences  we are told  owed largely to BIS Review 106/1997 - 2 - the difficulties in adjusting the prices of East German products to take into account that they were  on average  of lower quality than the equivalent items produced in the West. In thinking about the problems of price measurement  a distinction must be made between the measurement of individual prices  on the one hand  and the aggregation of those prices into indexes of the overall price level  on the other. The notion of what we mean by a general price level -- or more relevantly  its change -- is never unambiguously defined. Moreover  in practice  aggregation can be complicated because standard price indexes frequently assume that individuals and businesses purchase the same basket of goods and services over time -- whereas  in fact  people substitute some goods for others when relative prices change and as new goods are introduced. How one aggregates individual prices  of course  depends on the purpose of the measure. Still  the problems of aggregation are well understood by economists  and workable solutions are within reach. Many countries have made progress in utilizing aggregation formulas that do take into account product substitutions  and further progress in this area seems likely in the years ahead. It is the measurement of individual prices  not the aggregation of those prices  that is so difficult conceptually. At first glance  observing and measuring prices might not appear especially daunting. After all  prices are at the center of virtually all economic transactions. But  in fact  the problem is extraordinarily complex. To be sure  the nominal value -- in dollars or Deutsche Marks  for example -- of most transactions is unambiguously exact and  at least in principle  is amenable to highly accurate estimation by our statistical agencies. But dividing that nominal value change into components representing changes in real quantity versus price requires that one define a unit of output that is to remain constant over time. Defining such a constant-quality unit of output is the central conceptual difficulty in price measurement. Such a definition may be clear for unalloyed aluminium ingot of 99.7 percent purity for the vast proportion of transactions; consequently  its price can be compared over time with a degree of precision adequate for virtually all producers and consumers of aluminium ingot. Similarly  the prices of a ton of cold rolled steel sheet  or of a linear meter of cotton broad woven fabric  can be reasonably compared over a period of years. But when the characteristics of products and services are changing rapidly  defining the unit of output  and thereby adjusting an item’s price for improvements in quality  can be exceptionally difficult. These problems are becoming pervasive in modern economies as service prices  which are generally more difficult to measure  become more prominent in aggregate price measures. One does not have to look to the most advanced technology to recognize the difficulties that are faced. To take just a few examples  automobile tires  refrigerators  winter jackets  and tennis rackets have all changed in ways that make them surprisingly hard to compare to their counterparts of twenty or thirty years ago. The continual introduction of new goods and services onto the markets creates special challenges for price measurement. In some cases  a new good may best be viewed as an improved version of an old good. But  in many cases  new products may deliver services that simply were not available before. When personal computers were first introduced  the benefits they brought households in terms of word processing services  financial calculations  organizational assistance  and the like  were truly unique. The introduction of heart bypass operations literally prolonged many lives by decades. And  further in the past  think of the revolutionary changes that automobile ownership  or jet travel  brought to people’s lives. In theory  economists understand how to value such innovations; in practice  it is an enormous challenge to construct such an estimate with any precision. The area of medical care  where technology is changing in ways that make techniques of only a decade ago seem archaic  provides some particularly striking illustrations of the difficulties involved in measuring quality-adjusted prices. Cures and preventive treatments have become available for previously untreatable diseases. Medical advances have led to new treatments that are more effective and that have increased the speed and comfort of recovery. In an area with such rapid technological change  what is the appropriate unit of output? Is it a procedure  a treatment  or a cure? How does one BIS Review 106/1997 - 3 - value the benefit to the patient when a condition that once required a complicated operation and a lengthy stay in the hospital now can be easily treated on an outpatient basis? Although there is considerable uncertainty  the pace of change and the shift toward output that is difficult to measure are more likely to quicken than to slow down. How  then  will we measure inflation in the future if our measurement techniques become increasingly obsolete? We must keep in mind that  difficult as the problem seems  consistently measured prices do exist in principle. Embodied in all products is some unit of output  and hence of price  that is recognizable to those who buy and sell the product if not to the outside observer. A company that pays a sum of money for computer software knows what it is buying  and at least has an idea about its value relative to software it has purchased in the past  and relative to other possible uses for that sum of money in the present. Furthermore  so long as people continue to exchange nominal interest rate debt instruments and contract for future payments in terms of dollars or other currencies  there must be a presumption about the future purchasing power of money no matter how complex individual products become. Market participants do have a sense of the aggregate price level and how they expect it to change over time  and these views must be embedded in the value of financial assets. The emergence of inflation-indexed bonds  while providing us with useful information  does not solve the problem of ascertaining an economically meaningful measure of the general price level. By necessity  the total return on indexed bonds must be tied to forecasts of specific published price indexes  which may or may not reflect the market’s judgement of the future purchasing power of money. To the extent they do not  of course  the implicit real interest rate is biased in the opposite direction. Moreover  we are  as yet  unable to separate compensation for inflation risk from compensation for expected inflation. Eventually  financial markets may develop the instruments and associated analytical techniques for unearthing these implicit changes in the price level with some precision. In those circumstances  then -- at least for purposes of monetary policy -- these measures could obviate the more traditional approaches to aggregate price measurement now employed. They may help us understand  for example  whether markets perceive the true change in aggregate prices to reflect fixed or variable weight indexes of the components or whether arithmetic or logarithmic weighting of the components is more appropriate. But  for the foreseeable future  we shall have to rely on our statistical agencies to produce the price data necessary to assess economic performance and to make economic policy. In that regard  assuming further advances in economic science and provided that our statistical agencies receive adequate resources  procedures should continue to improve. To be sure  progress will not be easy for estimating the value of quality improvements is a painstaking process. It must be done methodically  item by item. But progress can be made. One improvement that has been made in recent years is a better ability to capture quality differences by pricing the underlying characteristics of complex products. With an increasingly wide range of product variants available to the public  product characteristics are now bundled together in an enormous variety of combinations. A “personal computer” is  in actuality  an amalgamation of computing speed  memory  networking capability  graphics capability  and so on. Computer manufacturers are moving toward build-to-order systems  in which any combination of these specifications and peripheral equipment is available to each individual buyer. Other examples abound. Advancements in computer-assisted design have reduced the costs of producing multiple varieties of small machine tools. The variety of commercial aircraft is much larger now than it was twenty years ago. And in services  witness the plethora of products now available from financial institutions  which have allowed a more complete disentangling and exchange of economic risks across participants around the world. Although hard data are scarce  there can be little doubt that products are tailor-made for the buyer to a larger extent than ever. Gone are the days when Henry Ford could say he would sell a car of any color “so long as it’s black”. BIS Review 106/1997 - 4 - In such an environment  when product characteristics are bundled together in so many different combinations  defining the unit of output means unbundling these characteristics and pricing each of them separately. The so-called hedonic technique is designed to do precisely that. This technique associates changes in a product’s price with changes in product characteristics. It therefore allows a quality comparison when new products with improved characteristics are introduced. Not surprisingly  one area in which this approach has been especially useful is in computer technology. In the United States  prior to the mid-1980s  computer prices simply were held constant in the national accounts. Now  with the introduction of hedonic techniques  the accounts show computer prices declining at double-digit rates  surely a more accurate estimate of the true quality-adjusted price change. The few other countries that have introduced these techniques -- France being the most recent -- show computer prices declining much more rapidly than in the majority of countries that have not yet done so. But hedonics are by no means a panacea. First of all  this technique obviously will be of no use in valuing the quality of an entirely new product that has fundamentally different characteristics from its predecessors. The benefits of cellular telephones  and the value they provide in terms of making calls from any location  cannot be measured from an examination of the attributes of standard telephones. In addition  the measured characteristics may only be proxies for the overall performance that consumers ultimately value. In the case of computers  the buyer ultimately cares about the quality of services that computer will provide -- word processing capabilities  database services  high-speed calculations  and so on. But  in many cases  the number of message instructions per second and the other easily measured characteristics may not be a wholly adequate proxy for the computer services that the buyer values. In these circumstances  the right approach  ultimately  may be to move toward directly pricing the services we obtain from our computers -- that is  word processing services  database management services  and so on -- rather than pricing separately the hardware and software. The issues surrounding the appropriate measurement of computer prices also illustrate some of the difficulties of valuing goods and services when there are significant interactions among users of the products. New generations of computers sometimes require software that is incompatible with previous generations  and some users who have no need for the improved computing power nevertheless may feel compelled to purchase the new technology because they need to remain compatible with the bulk of users who are at the frontier. Even if our techniques allow us to accurately measure consumers’ valuation of the increased speed and power of the new generation of computer  we may miss the negative influence on some consumers of this incompatibility. Therefore  even in the case of personal computers  where we have made such great strides in measuring quality changes  I suspect that important phenomena still may not be adequately captured by our published price indexes. Despite the advances in price measurement that have been made over the years  there remains considerable room for improvement. In the United States  a group of experts empanelled by the Senate Finance Committee -- the Boskin commission -- concluded that the consumer price index has overstated changes in the cost of living by roughly one percentage point per annum in recent years. About half of this bias owed to inadequate adjustment for quality improvement and the introduction of new goods  and about half reflected the manner in which the individual prices were aggregated. Researchers at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere have come up with similar figures. Although the estimates of bias owing to inadequate adjustment for quality improvements surely are the most uncertain aspect of this calculation  the preponderance of evidence is that  on average  such a bias in quality adjustment does exist. The Boskin commission  along with most other estimates of bias in the U.S. CPI  have taken a micro-statistical approach  estimating separately the magnitude of each category of potential bias. Recent work by staff economists at the Federal Reserve Board has added corroborating evidence of price mis-measurement  using a macroeconomic approach the independent of is essentially that BIS Review 106/1997 - 5 - micro-statistical exercises. Specifically  employing disaggregated data from the national income and product accounts  this research finds that the measured growth of real output and productivity in the service sector is implausibly weak  given that the return to owners of businesses in that sector apparently has been well-maintained. Indeed  the published data indicate that the level of output per hour in a number of service-producing industries has been falling for more than two decades. It is simply not credible that firms in these industries have been becoming less and less efficient for more than twenty years. Much more reasonable is the view that prices have been mis-measured and that the true quality-adjusted prices have been rising more slowly than the published price indexes. Properly measured  output and productivity trends in these service industries might be considerably stronger than suggested by the published data. Assuming  for example  no change in productivity for these industries would imply a price bias consistent with the Boskin commission findings. Of course  the United States is not the only country that faces challenges in constructing an accurate measure of inflation. Other countries -- Germany among them -- confront similar issues. In a recent survey of consumer price indexes in its member countries  the OECD found that most countries felt that measurement bias was smaller in magnitude in their own countries than in the United States. Certainly regarding quality adjustment  however  I doubt that this is generally the case. Many countries’ responses were prepared by the countries’ statistical agencies  which tend to take a somewhat more sanguine view of the adequacy of the existing price statistics than do outside economists. But  in any case  the OECD survey did indicate that many countries reported that measurement bias was a concern and that most countries do not adequately adjust their statistics for quality improvements. Indeed  as I noted previously  most European countries still have yet to adopt the most up-to-date techniques for measuring computer prices in their national accounts. As the OECD survey recognized  the challenges presented by rapid technological advances have affected all of us -- not just the United States. Thus  potential sources of measurement bias should be seriously examined in all countries. Indeed  issues of price measurement may be especially important for the European countries entering into monetary union. For a region with a single monetary policy  a single  consistently estimated measure of inflation is necessary to gauge the region’s economic performance. Toward that end  as you know  Eurostat publishes harmonized indexes of consumer prices that are constructed using a common basket of goods and services for each EU member state and using similar statistical methodology. These measures should go a long way toward providing a conceptually sound basis for judging convergence of EU member states in the selection of countries to participate in monetary union. Subsequent to monetary union  harmonized consumer prices can be used as the best available measure of inflation in the Euro area. However  as it now stands  the harmonized measures do not contain a broad coverage of consumer services. Most notably  the costs of owner-occupied housing -- a sizable share of consumer expenditures -- are excluded from the harmonized indexes. In the United States  for example  the CPI calculated on this harmonized basis would have increased three or four tenths of a percentage point more slowly than the published CPI  on average  over the past few years  largely because prices of owner-occupied housing have been rising more rapidly than the other components. Arguably  the published index  with broader coverage  is more relevant to assessing inflation trends in the United States than would be the harmonized index. As long as relative prices can and do diverge across countries  the harmonized indexes need to contain as broad a range of items as is practical. As monetary union proceeds  then  it would be to the advantage of monetary authorities in the Euro area to have a consistent measure of inflation defined over a broad basket of goods and services that is measured according to established statistical methods. Most useful would be for the member countries to continue the harmonization process until the national statistical agencies are truly working on a consistent basis. Indeed  measuring prices consistently across countries could be an important step toward making price measurement more accurate everywhere  if harmonization results in each country’s best practices being adopted throughout the monetary union. Moreover  different prices of the same tradable good across the community might signal inefficiencies of distribution which were not evident from other sources. BIS Review 106/1997 - 6 - Harmonization of CPIs in Europe is just one of many examples demonstrating why price measurement techniques cannot be static. With innovation constantly leading to new products  greater variety  and higher quality  the statistical agencies must work ever harder just to stay in place. A government official in the United States once compared a nation’s statistical system to a tailor  measuring the economy much as a tailor measures a person for a suit of clothes -- with the difference that  unlike the tailor  the person we are measuring is running while we try to measure him. The only way the system can succeed  he said  is to be just as fast and twice as agile. That is the challenge that lies ahead  and it is  indeed  a large one. There are  however  reasons for optimism. The information revolution  which lies behind so much of the rapid technological change that makes prices difficult to measure  may also play an important role in helping our statistical agencies acquire the necessary speed and agility to better capture the changes taking place in our economies. For example  computers might some day allow our statistical agencies to tap into a great many economic transactions on a nearly real-time basis. Utilizing data from store checkout scanners  which the United States is now investigating  may be an important first step in that direction. But the possibilities offered by information technology for the improvement of price measurement may turn out to be much broader in scope. Just as it is difficult to predict the ways in which technology will change our consumption over time  so is it difficult to predict how economic and statistical science will make creative use of the improved technology. Such advances must be taken to ensure that our economic statistics remain adequate to support the public policy decisions that must be made. If the challenge for our statistical agencies is not to lose in their race against technology  the challenge for policymakers is to make our best judgements about the limitations of the existing statistics  as we design policies to promote the economic well-being of our nations.

Introduction: competitiveness and productivity I have been asked to discuss the New Zealand economy in a medium-term context  with particular reference to the place of forestry. I am conscious also of the overall theme of this conference -- The Competition Gap. I applaud the Association for choosing to focus on that theme  because while that is clearly a very relevant issue for the forestry sector to be debating  it is equally relevant to the broader economy. We all wish to raise living standards in New Zealand. The reform effort of the past 13 years has been focused on precisely that goal. To achieve it  we require a sustained lift in productivity  across the New Zealand economy. Improved productivity and “meeting the competition gap” are one and the same thing. It is not my intention to provide a substantive projection of New Zealand’s economic prospects over the growth cycle of a GF17 pine tree. Nor do I intend to discuss the likely prospects of the forestry sector. Rather  I will try to lay out a few of the very broad factors that will shape the development of the New Zealand economy over the medium term  and to reflect a little on the factors that influence interest rates and exchange rates over longer time horizons. The determinants of economic growth Last month  Governor Don Brash delivered a speech to the Auckland Rotary Club under the topic “How Fast Can the New Zealand Economy Grow?” The key theme of that speech was that our growth potential is determined ultimately by quantities and quality. The quantity of people and the quantity of capital -- in the form of factories  forests  trucks  roads  computers and all the tools of a modern economy. And the quality of those same inputs -- how well they work  and how efficiently they are deployed. As Dr. Brash went on to say  the Reserve Bank believes that New Zealand’s longer-term growth potential is probably of the order of 3 percent annually at present -- a result of a trend growth in the working age population of around 1.5 percent and trend growth in output per person  or productivity  also of around 1.5 percent. Lifting that growth potential requires bigger quantities or better qualities -- of people  attitudes  and equipment. On the quantities side  we can’t do a great deal in the short term about the size of the working age population. After centuries of diligent practice  it still takes around 9 months to produce a new Kiwi and  only a little quicker than Pinus Radiata -- around 20 years -- to get that new Kiwi into the work force. Of course  we can import new workers “ready built up”. But even then  as we have discovered in recent years  there are limitations on how quickly new immigrants can be absorbed. In any event  while increasing the size of the labour force may enable us to boost overall economic growth  what really matters for living standards is per capita growth. And that BIS Review 107/1997 - 2 - means we need to focus on output per person  or the productivity of our work force  not just its raw quantity. In the longer term  and at the risk of doing some violence to the wealth of economic research on the subject  productivity is heavily dependent on one key factor -- the quality of our human resources. Living standards rise on the back of overall educational attainment and attitudes. That implies a continuing need to raise the quality of our general educational effort. It means raising the numbers participating in higher education. It means improved on-the-job training. It means better-trained managers able to make smarter decisions and provide improved management of our work force -- in the forest  on the factory floor  in the research laboratories  within both the public and private sectors. And it means smarter governance from within the nation’s boardrooms. The role of capital investment Intertwined with the quality of our work force and how well it is managed is the issue of the quality and quantity of physical capital available to each person. By teaming better-trained people with better technology and working with more and better physical capital we can provide a recipe for making serious progress in raising productivity. And through that  we can make serious advances in our living standards. New Zealand’s history provides some useful insights into the role of capital investment. During our slow growth phase -- through the 1970s and 1980s -- our investment levels were quite respectable by the standards of other developed economies -- somewhere around 25 percent of GDP per annum. What was impeding growth was not so much an inadequate quantity of investment  but poor quality investment -- a persistent tendency to direct capital into low-yielding activities. The sources of that misdirection of capital are not hard to find. They lie with government-led investment decisions -- for example  “Think Big” projects -- and with investment encouraged into sectors or activities sheltered by protections of various kinds. It is those protections -- the import quotas  licensing arrangements  or tax incentives -- that produce situations in which the returns to private investors become disconnected from the underlying market realities. The individual investor may be profiting as a consequence of those protections  but only at the cost of overall national efficiency and income. Raising productivity means allowing change It is with those considerations in mind that countries seeking to boost their growth performance look to micro-economic reforms -- to reduced protection  to deregulation  to flatter and broader tax structures  to increased market flexibility -- in order to encourage available resources of labour and capital to move into those areas where private financial returns and national economic returns are similarly high. Of course  encouraging the flow of resources into higher-yielding activities also implies that those same resources  labour and capital  are permitted to move away from activities in which returns are low. So when we see sheep and beef farms being converted into either dairy units  on the one hand  or pine forests on the other  we need to check if there are particular regulatory or taxation reasons encouraging that shift. If there are none  we are entitled to conclude that rational investors are making a judgement that the future returns on investment in dairying or forestry are likely to be superior to the future returns on sheep and beef farming. Moreover  we are entitled to BIS Review 107/1997 - 3 - presume that  as a result of that changed land use  our national growth potential will be higher. The efficiency of our capital stock will have increased. Of course  rational investors may be wrong in their judgements. Only time will tell. But so long as those investors are risking their own money  in an efficient regulatory and tax environment  we stand the best possible chance of maximising the performance of the economy overall. One message should be very clear. We cannot lift our economic performance by locking land  labour or capital into low-yielding activities. Lifting our growth performance will inevitably mean continuing change  including the decline of some sectors  in order to free resources for movement to expanding  higher-yielding activities. And in a world of ever-faster innovation  the high performance economies are likely to be the more flexible ones -- the ones most able to quickly take up emerging technologies and production processes and to encourage the shift of resources from one industry or production technique to another. Monetary policy has a background role in facilitating faster growth You will note that so far I have managed to avoid any mention of monetary policy or the role of the Reserve Bank in all of this. Interest rates and exchange rates haven’t entered the equation. That’s because monetary policy and the Reserve Bank have an important  but essentially “background”  role in allowing the economy to achieve its longer-term growth potential. A couple of points are relevant here. What I have discussed so far are the “real” contributors to economic growth -- the quantity and quality of inputs. These are the “supply side” factors. Monetary policy and the Reserve Bank operate on the demand side. The task of monetary policy is to maintain price stability. That involves ensuring that demand in the economy grows roughly in line with the capacity of the economy to meet that demand. The Reserve Bank’s Policy Targets Agreement (PTA)  signed by the Minister of Finance and the Governor  sets a 0 to 3 percent inflation target as the Governor’s sole objective. The PTA establishes that single objective of price stability “... so that monetary policy can make its maximum contribution to sustainable economic growth  employment and development opportunities within the New Zealand economy”. The rationale for that position is quite straightforward  and is particularly relevant to a sector such as forestry  which involves such long investment horizons. In an inflation-free environment  investors and the public generally get their best shot at reading accurately the signals that markets are delivering -- which goods and services represent best value  where the best returns on investment may be found  how much to consume and how much to save. Simply adopting an easy monetary policy does nothing to increase the supply of labour or its skill level. It does nothing to improve the availability of better technologies. But most importantly  an easy monetary policy that gives rise to a risk of future inflation is likely to divert investment and the flow of resources away from sectors with longer-term investment horizons -- such as forestry -- towards quick-return real estate and similar investments that exploit the tax and other distortions which emerge in an inflationary environment. BIS Review 107/1997 - 4 - Once price stability has been achieved  monetary policy is essentially an exercise in smoothing economic cycles -- slowing the economy when it looks likely to overheat  stimulating it as activity slows. That is not a straightforward exercise. Even if we get it right  (and we won’t always) there will still be economic cycles. But we should be able to avoid the boom/bust cycles of old. If our longer-term growth potential is around 3 percent  it is probably the case that growth outturns in the 1 percent to 5 percent range will be the norm. Occasional external shocks and surprises -- climate  international events  and so on -- may take us outside that range. But surprises of that sort should be rare. However  a sustained growth performance within a range of that sort would represent a substantial step up from our experience through the 1960s and 1970s  and would place us somewhere near the top end of the OECD growth league. Interest rates are determined by international conditions and local risk factors So what does that mean for interest rates and exchange rates in New Zealand over the longer term? Essentially  in our world of open capital markets  interest rates in New Zealand will tend to settle at some margin above or below a benchmark set in US financial markets. How large that margin is (and whether it is positive or negative) will depend on the risks and returns that savers  both domestic and foreign  associate with New Zealand. There are  of course  many different risks that enter that assessment. But a key one is the risk of future inflation. A firm commitment to the maintenance of price stability is already resulting in substantially lower interest rates in New Zealand. The rate paid by the New Zealand Government on its New Zealand dollar 10-year bonds has fallen from around 10 percentage points above that paid by the US Government on 10-year US dollar bonds in the mid 1980s  to little more than half of one percent above the US rate. Our shorter-term interest rates have also fallen sharply relative to those in other countries over the past decade or so  but they remain high by OECD standards  and high in real terms. That will remain the case so long as the strong demand for borrowing that we have seen over the past several years continues. On that note  it is worth reminding ourselves that the route to consistently lower interest rates lies in allowing both savers and borrowers to become confident that the risk of future inflation is slight. We can’t look to the exchange rate to boost international competitiveness A conference examining competitiveness may find it tempting to look to the exchange rate for salvation at some point. Don’t bother. The forestry industry  like every other export industry in New Zealand  is going to have to live with an exchange rate that varies. There is nothing you can do about that  and there is nothing the government or the Reserve Bank can do about that. We live in a world of floating exchange rates. BIS Review 107/1997 - 5 - While it is conceivable that we could fix our exchange rate to the US dollar  or the Australian dollar  or even the TWI (as we once did) we can’t fix to all simultaneously. Inevitably we have to learn to cope with exchange rate variability. In fact  on measures of shorter-term exchange rate volatility  the New Zealand dollar is a surprisingly good performer. Day-to-day volatility of our currency is modest when measured alongside the experience of other developed countries -- even those much larger than New Zealand. To assess the impact of longer-term exchange rate trends  we need to look to measures of the “real” or inflation-adjusted exchange rate -- because that is what matters for exporters. On that basis  we find that the New Zealand dollar moves through the inevitable cycles  but will typically be found within about 15 percent to 20 percent of its longer-term average. Our recent experience has been consistent with that. The real TWI was around 10 percent below its long-term average at its last trough in 1992. At its recent peak  in April of this year  it was around 17 percent above that same longer-term average. While cycles in the real exchange rate of that amplitude can certainly create discomfort for exporters  it is clear that they are well within the range experienced by other currencies. In essence  exporters should be factoring cycles of that sort into their business planning. It is clearly relevant to the variability of their future earnings stream  and therefore  to the value of their assets and to the nature of the capital structure they require to stay in business. Of course  it is also relevant to their balance sheet management and to risk-hedging strategies they may need to adopt. The best contribution that governments and central banks can make to moderating real exchange rate cycles is to embrace policy consistency and transparency -- in monetary policy  fiscal policy  and in tax and regulatory policies. The decline in exchange rate volatility in recent years provides some evidence to support that. One point we should all be clear on. There is no future in thinking we can pursue competitiveness  in forestry or any other sector  through attempts to use monetary policy to engineer a weaker exchange rate. I say that for several reasons: • Competitiveness and the productivity improvements that ensure competitiveness are products of “real” advances in efficiency  technology and management. Lowering the exchange rate makes no one more efficient. • The focus of monetary policy on the single objective of price stability is key to convincing savers and investors that  in taking their decisions  they do not need to factor in a large inflation risk. It is only in that way that we can get sustainably lower interest rates. • As our own history well demonstrates  any short-term gains that may be available to exporters as a result of a one-off depreciation of the exchange rate are quickly eroded as future inflation increases. As a fix for competitiveness problems  exchange rate depreciations are both addictive and ultimately destructive. • Central banks do not determine real exchange rates in the long term. Markets and relative economic efficiency/productivity trends determine real exchange rates. What of the balance of payments deficit? Let me touch on one other issue that is relevant to the longer-term behaviour of the New Zealand dollar and New Zealand interest rates -- the balance of payments. BIS Review 107/1997 - 6 - We are currently running a current account deficit of the order of 6 percent of GDP. That puts us amongst the largest external deficits in the OECD. Note also that New Zealand’s net foreign debt currently amounts to around 80 percent of GDP -- which puts us at the top end of international experience. To prevent that external debt ratio from increasing further  it is necessary for the current account deficit to decrease to less than the annual growth of GDP -- ie  to something less than about 3 percent. The key issue here is domestic savings behaviour. To the extent that domestic savings are insufficient to fund the nation’s investment needs  we must rely on foreign savings. And if we are reliant on foreign savings  we must  by definition  continue to run a current account deficit. That is a simple accounting identity. I note with interest the estimates of some commentators who suggest that the forestry industry alone will require substantial volumes of foreign investment over the next few years. They may be correct in their estimates of investment needs. But if those needs are met from foreign investment  we must accept that that is equivalent to saying that New Zealand must continue to run a current account deficit. Will New Zealand generally  and the forestry sector in particular  have difficulty attracting the investment capital it requires? Probably not. So long as investors have confidence in the quality of our industries  the reliability of future earning streams  and the quality of our future macro and micro economic policies  it is unlikely that we will have difficulty in attracting the necessary investment. We compete in a global market to sell our products. Equally  we compete in a global market to attract savings for investment. The pool of savings available globally is enormous  and New Zealand’s needs represent just a minute fraction of that available. New Zealand need not  therefore  regard itself as investment constrained. But to the extent that our domestic savings fall short of the levels required to fund our investment needs  our external debt ratios continue to rise  then the risks perceived by potential investors will also rise. With higher risks come increased interest rate margins. It is probably also the case that those high external debt ratios leave New Zealand a little more vulnerable to shifts in international market sentiment  which may reveal themselves in sharp and sometimes disruptive movements in interest rates and exchange rates. For those reasons  it is our belief that New Zealand would face a more secure future if our dependence on the savings of others were reduced. BIS Review 107/1997

Meyer  a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the Conference on Small Business Finance held at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business  Berkley Center for Entrepreneurial Studies and New York University Salomon Center in New York on 23/5/97. It is a pleasure to be here to meet with you at New York University for this Conference on Small Business Finance. It is clear from the conference program that there is an excellent mix of academics  government representatives  and practitioners here to study how small business is financed. Indeed  I am glad to see so much attention being paid to this important topic. Small business is a vital and energetic part of our economy that plays a key role in the generation of jobs  new ideas  and the encouragement of entrepreneurial activity. Without doubt  a thriving small business sector contributes to the well-being of our nation. Today  I would like to share with you some thoughts about the role of banks in supplying credit to small business. The part played by banks in small business finance is not a new topic for the Federal Reserve. In fact  for many years we have been devoting substantial resources to collecting and analyzing data on small business finance generally  and the credit supplied by banks in particular. We collect data from small businesses on how they obtain financing -- or in some cases fail to obtain financing -- using the National Survey of Small Business Finance and the Survey of Consumer Finances. We also gather information directly on the small business credit extended by individual commercial banks. We have collected information on the contract terms of bank loans to both small and large businesses since 1977 through the Survey of Terms of Bank Lending to Business. Since 1993  the banking agencies have required all commercial banks to report their quantities of loans to businesses by size of loan on the June Call Reports. Lastly  as part of revised Community Reinvestment Act procedures  the banking agencies have just this year begun to collect data on small business loans by local geographic area. When these data become available  they should prove to be a rich source of new information. A number of economists have used the existing data in research that has helped us to better understand the potential effects on the supply of small business credit of public policies regarding bank mergers and acquisitions  financial modernization  and prudential supervision may be reducing the supply of credit to small business  since larger banking institutions tend to devote smaller proportions of their assets to small business lending. Solid economic research applying modern econometric techniques to accurate data is needed to evaluate such claims and to determine the likely effects of policy actions in order to improve future policy decisions. The Importance of the Bank-Small Business Relationship According to our survey information  commercial banks are the single most important source of external credit to small firms. Small businesses rely on banks not just for a reliable supply of credit  but for transactions and deposit services as well. Because of their needs for banking services on both the asset and liability sides of their balance sheets  small businesses typically enter into relationships with nearby banks. The data show  for example  that 85 percent of small businesses use the services of a commercial bank within 30 miles of their firm  and that small businesses typically obtain multiple different services from their local bank. The 30 miles actually overstates the distance that small businesses are willing to travel for most of their basic financial services. For example  the median distances from a small business’ offices to the BIS Review 57/1997 - 2 - institutions where it obtains deposit  credit  or financial management services are all 5 miles or less. One of the reasons why the banking relationship is so important to small business finance is that banks can efficiently gain valuable information on a small business over the course of their relationship  and then use this information to help make pricing and credit decisions. The financial conditions of small firms are usually rather opaque to investors  and the costs of issuing securities directly to the public are prohibitive for most small firms. Thus  without financial intermediaries like banks it would simply be too costly for most investors to learn the information needed to provide the credit  and too costly for the small firm to issue the credit itself. Banks  performing the classic functions of financial intermediaries  solve these problems by producing information about borrowers and monitoring them over time  by setting loan contract terms to improve borrower incentives  by renegotiating the terms if and when the borrower is in financial difficulty  and by diversifying the risks across many small business credits. Some recent empirical research suggests that this characterization of the bank-small business borrower relationship is accurate. For example  as the relationship matures  banks typically reduce the interest rates charged and often drop the collateral requirements on small business loans. In short  the bank-borrower relationship appears to be an efficient means for overcoming information and cost problems in small firm finance  and for allowing fundamentally creditworthy small firms to finance sound projects that might otherwise go unfunded. One implication of the importance of the bank-small business relationship is that it may impose limits on the migration of small business finance out of the banking sector. Over the last two decades  many large business loans left the banking sector as improvements in information technology  increased use of statistical techniques in applied finance  and the globalization of financial markets have allowed nonbank and foreign bank competitors to gain market share over U.S. banks. For example  over the 1980s and first half of the 1990s  the share of total U.S. nonfarm  nonfinancial corporate debt held by U.S. banks fell by about one-quarter from 19.6 percent to 14.5 percent. Banks compensated somewhat for these on-balance sheet reductions in a variety of ways. Many banks expanded their participation in off-balance sheet back-up lines of credit  standby letters of credit  and the securitization and sale of some large loans. Other adaptations included a shift in focus toward fee-based services and derivatives activities. The types of developments that might similarly reduce bank market share in small business lending are proceeding rather slowly at present  but may accelerate in the future. Improvements in analytical and information technologies such as credit scoring may decrease the cost of lending to small businesses and make it easier for nonbank lenders to enter this market. These developments are already contributing to more competition for small business loans within the banking industry and between bank and nonbank lenders. Similarly  a significant secondary market for securitization of loans to some small businesses may develop in the future. Those small businesses among current bank borrowers whose information problems are the least severe -- that is  those that are the least informationally opaque -- would presumably be the most likely to be funded outside of the banking system. Nevertheless  no matter how many advances there are in information processing and no matter how sophisticated financial markets may become  there will likely remain a significant role for bank-borrower relationship lending to solve the information and other BIS Review 57/1997 - 3 - financing problems of small businesses. That is  in the foreseeable future it seems very likely that there will remain many small business borrowers with sufficient problems that only bank information gathering  monitoring  and financing can overcome  although this group of borrowers will almost surely differ somewhat from current relationship borrowers. As technology and markets improve to the point that some relatively transparent small business borrowers can be financed outside the bank  other  more opaque potential borrowers that previously had information and other problems too serious for even a bank loan will enter the bank intermediation process. Put another way  the relationship lending process will fund small business borrowers with increasingly difficult information problems as the technology for resolving these problems improves. In my view  this should only increase the efficiency and the competitiveness of small business finance. For example  the improved ability of banks to lend to more opaque borrowers should provide some increased competition for the venture capitalists and angel financiers that were discussed at the conference yesterday. The value of gathering information through the relationship between banks and small businesses also bodes well for the survival of small community-based banks that tend to specialize in these relationships. Most forecasts of the future of the U.S. banking industry predict that thousands of small banks will survive. I hasten to point out that these are not my personal forecasts. I stick to predicting interest rates  GDP growth  and inflation -- items over which I have more control and inside information -- and I leave the banking forecasts to others! But the forecast of thousands of small banks continuing to operate and do well makes sense to me. They have information advantages  knowhow  and local community orientations that are hard to duplicate in large organizations. The importance of relationship lending to small business also raises prudential concerns about bank risk taking. When a bank fails  the losses to society exceed the book values involved because of the loss of the value of the bank’s customer relationships. Even if small business borrowers are able to find financing after their bank fails  it may be at a higher interest rate and with additional collateral requirements until the new bank has had a chance to learn about the borrower’s condition and prospects. When many banks fail during a crisis  this can create a credit crunch or significant reduction in the supply of credit to bank-dependent small business borrowers. For example  research on the Great Depression suggests that the loss of bank-borrower relationships in the 1930s may have deepened and prolonged the economic downturn. More recently  it appears that the weak capital positions of many banks in the late 1980s and early 1990s  not to mention the outright failure of over 1 100 banks during this period  contributed importantly to the sharp slowdown in bank commercial lending during the early 1990s. While the ability of small businesses to find alternative sources of funds is considerably greater today than in the 1930s  and will likely be even greater in the future than it was in the early 1990s  such arguments do reinforce the importance of the connection between macroeconomic and bank supervisory policy. Financial Modernization and Bank Small Business Lending In the remainder of my remarks  I will touch on three additional concerns about the potential effects of financial modernization on the supply of bank credit to small business. I will first discuss the effects of increases in market concentration created by bank mergers and acquisitions within a local market; second  the effects of consolidation of the banking industry as a whole; and third  the possible impacts of the increased complexity of financial service firms in which banking and other organizations may provide a multitude of traditional banking and nonbanking services. BIS Review 57/1997 - 4 - At the outset  I would emphasize that the overriding public policy concern regarding these issues is not the quantity of small business lending  but rather economic efficiency. If some banks are issuing loans to finance negative net present value projects  then such loans should be discouraged. If consolidation of the banking industry or the increased complexity of financial services firms reduces such lending  then economic efficiency is promoted by freeing up those resources to be invested elsewhere  even though the supply of small business credit to these borrowers is reduced. Similarly  a lack of competition or poor corporate control may currently be keeping some positive net present value loans from being made. If modernization increases the supply of loans to creditworthy small business borrowers to pursue financially sound projects  then economic efficiency is also raised as the supply of credit to these small businesses rises. Antitrust analysis in banking has typically been based on the concentration of bank deposits in local markets like Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) or non-MSA rural counties. Under the traditional “cluster approach ” small business loans and other products are assumed to be competitive on approximately the same basis as bank deposits in local markets. While on-going technological and institutional changes seem likely to erode the usefulness of this assumption over time  evidence continues to generally support this assumption. As I noted earlier  small businesses typically get their loans and other financial services from a local bank. Additional research finds that the concentration of the local banking market is a key determinant of the rates that are charged on small business loans. For example  it is estimated that small business borrowers in the most concentrated markets pay rates about 50 to 150 basis points higher than those in the least concentrated markets. This exceeds estimates of the effects of local market concentration on retail deposit rates of about 50 basis points. Research has also suggested that high local-market deposit concentration may lead to reduced managerial efficiency  as the price cushion provided by market power allows a “quiet life” for managers in which relatively little effort is required to be profitable. Managers in these concentrated markets may choose to work less hard or pursue their own personal interests because the lower rates on deposits and higher rates on small business loans raise profits enough to cover for inefficient or self-serving practices. These findings support the need to maintain competition in local banking markets to deter the exercise of market power in pricing consumer deposits and small business loans  and to ensure that the local banks are under sufficient competitive pressure that they are operated in a reasonably efficient way. When bank mergers and acquisitions involve banks operating in different local markets  the issues raised are typically quite different from those I have just discussed. Since the late 1970s  states have been liberalizing laws that previously restricted mergers and acquisitions between banks in different local markets  including allowing holding company acquisitions across state lines. The U.S. banking industry has responded strongly and has been consolidating at a rapid rate over the last 15 years. Consolidation has picked up even more in the first half of the 1990s -- each year bank mergers have involved about 20 percent of industry assets. This trend is likely to continue or accelerate under the Riegle-Neal Act  which has already allowed increased interstate banking  and which will allow interstate branching into almost all states this summer. Importantly  an increase in local market concentration is not a major issue in most of these mergers and acquisitions  as they are primarily of the market-extension type. As such  these consolidations  and sometimes merely the threat of such actions  may be pro-competitive BIS Review 57/1997 - 5 - and reduce the market power of local banks over depositors and small business borrowers in the markets that are invaded. They may also improve the diversification and efficiency of the consolidating institutions. Research generally suggests that most mergers and acquisitions  by improving diversification  allow the consolidating institutions to make more loans and improve their profit efficiency. Mostly as a result of these mergers and acquisitions  the mean size of banking organizations has approximately doubled in real terms in the last 15 years. As I mentioned earlier  a frequently voiced concern about this consolidation is whether the supply of credit to small business may be decreased  since larger banking institutions tend to devote smaller proportions of their assets to small business lending. To illustrate  banks with under $100 million in assets devote about 9 percent of their assets to small business lending on average  whereas banks with over $10 billion in assets invest only about 2 percent of assets in these loans. While such a simplistic analysis may sound appealing on the surface  it is clearly incomplete. It neglects the fundamental nature of mergers and acquisitions as dynamic events that may involve significant changes in the business focus of the consolidating institutions. That is  banks get involved in mergers and acquisitions because they want to do something different  not simply behave like a larger bank. The simplistic comparison of the lending patterns of large and small banks also ignores the reactions of other lenders in the same local markets. Other existing or even new local banks or nonbank lenders might pick up any profitable loans that are no longer supplied by the consolidated banking institutions. These other institutions may also react to M&As with their own dynamic changes in focus that could either increase or decrease their supplies of small business loans. Thus  even if merging institutions reduce their own supplies of small business loans substantially  the total supply of these loans in the local market need not decline. There have been a number of recent studies of these dynamic effects of bank mergers and acquisitions  some of which we heard about this morning. The results suggest that the dynamic effects of mergers and acquisitions are much more complex and heterogenous than would be suggested by the increased sizes of the consolidating institutions alone. For example  mergers of small and medium-sized banks appear to be associated with increases in small business lending by the merging banks  whereas mergers of large banks may be associated with decreases in small business lending by the participants. On average  mergers appear to reduce small business lending by the participants  but this decline appears to be offset in part or in whole by an increase in lending by other banks in the same local market. These other banks may pick up profitable loans that are dropped by merging institutions  or otherwise have dynamic reactions that increase their supplies of small business lending. Moreover  these results do not include the potential for increased lending by nonbank firms. The bottom line is that small business loan markets seem to work quite well. Creditworthy borrowers with financially sound projects seem to receive financing  although they sometimes have to bear the short-term switching costs  such as temporarily higher loan rates and collateral requirements  of changing banks after their institutions merge. On-going technological change in small business lending should only help to improve the efficiency of this process. Again  I would emphasize that it is not the quantity of small business loans supplied that is most important  but rather the economic efficiency with which the market chooses which small businesses receive credit. To the extent that mergers and acquisitions are pro-competitive and improve corporate control and efficiency  the supply of credit to some BIS Review 57/1997 - 6 - borrowers with negative net present value projects may be reduced  as it should be. That is  the protection from competition provided by interstate and intrastate barriers may have allowed some firms with market power to be inefficient or make uneconomic loans. Similarly  any improvement in competition and efficiency may increase the supply of credit to borrowers with positive net present value projects that inefficient lenders previously did not fund. In either of these cases  economic efficiency is improved. As promised  the final issue I will discuss is that aspect of the modernization of financial markets in which financial service firms are likely to become more complex  providing more types of financial services within the same organization. At the present time  we do not know if and when the Glass-Steagall Act will be repealed  whether nontraditional activities will be provided by bank subsidiaries or bank holding company affiliates  and in which activities banking organizations will be allowed to engage or choose to engage. However  similar to the arguments regarding consolidation of the banking industry  concern is sometimes expressed that small business borrowers may receive less credit from these larger  more complex financial institutions. There is much less research evidence available regarding the potential effects on small business lending of this type of financial modernization than there is about the consolidation of the banking industry  so my remarks here are substantially more speculative. However  I believe there are several reasons for optimism regarding adequate supplies of services to creditworthy small businesses. First  a limited amount of research suggests that there is little if any effect of the current organizational complexity of U.S. banks on their treatment of small businesses  other things equal. In particular  banking organizations with multiple layers of management  those that operate in multiple states  those with Section 20 securities affiliates  and those with other organizational complexities tend to charge about as much for small business credit as other banks of their same size. Second  the research results for the consolidation of banks alone suggest that if profitable loans are dropped by the newer universal-like banks  other small banks or nonbank firms will be standing by to pick up these loans. Finally  the additional insurance  securities underwriting  or other financial services provided by the new institutions should provide greater opportunities for small businesses to have access to these nontraditional services. I want to leave time for questions  so let me conclude with a few summary comments. It is gratifying to see all of this attention being paid to the financing of small business  which is a vital part of our economy  and the Federal Reserve is working actively to stay abreast of the issues with its data collection and research efforts. Small businesses tend to rely on banks for their credit needs and other financial services  and relationships between banks and small businesses are important and efficient means of distributing these services. While technological and institutional changes are and undoubtedly will in the future affect these relationships  it seems unlikely that the core bank-small business relationship will be replaced. The continued heavy dependence of small businesses on local banks also suggests an on-going need for bank supervisors to be sensitive to antitrust issues when considering mergers and acquisitions of banks in the same local market. In contrast  cross-market mergers rarely raise antitrust concerns; indeed  such mergers can be quite pro-competitive. Finally  while some observers have argued that banking consolidation and other aspects of the modernization of the banking industry and financial markets raise concerns about the supply of credit to small business  the market for small business loans in fact seems to work rather well. If there is a merger or other event that reduces the supply of profitable loans to small businesses  other banks seem to step in and provide this credit  and there is every reason to expect that such responses will continue in the future.

Challenge number one - to find consensus on what the objective of monetary policy should be in South Africa In the international community of central bankers  there is widespread consensus that the primary goal of monetary policy must be domestic price stability. Price stability  however  is only a means to an end  and not a final goal of overall macroeconomic policy. The ultimate goal is determined by governments and is normally linked to the objective of maximum economic growth  development and the creation of more employment opportunities. Contemporary economic theory supports the view  however  that financial stability  as measured by a low rate of inflation  is a precondition for the attainment of optimum economic development. Furthermore  monetary policy  being only one of the sub-elements of overall macroeconomic policy  is tasked with the responsibility to create and maintain such a stable financial environment that will be conducive for sustainable economic growth at an optimum rate in the medium and longer term. In South Africa  however  confusion remains on what the task and the functions of the central bank should be. The most important delusion  supported by certain business people  politicians and even some academics  is linked to the now defunct Phillips curve approach in terms of which the assumption is made that a higher inflation rate can produce a sustained lift in growth and employment. World-wide experience  as long back as in the 1970s  provided sufficient evidence that the assumed trade-off of higher inflation for lower unemployment could only be exploited over the limited period in which inflation expectations did not fully adjust to the new higher rate of inflation. With a more effective implementation of the theory of rational expectations within modern communities  this limited period has indeed become very short. Another reason why the conventional theory of demand management through the application of monetary policy is no longer appropriate is the major shift that took place in recent years in macroeconomic management  away from conventional Keynesian demand management to contemporary supply-side economics. The Phillips curve approach is based on the theory of demand-driven inflationary or deflationary conditions. The world-wide situation in the 1970s  when there was a simultaneous rise in inflation and in unemployment in many of the industrial countries  refuted the theory of the trade-off and forced new thinking on particularly the implementation of monetary policy. The present universal approach on monetary policy therefore takes account of the new electronic environment of instant communication leading to a more swift dissection of policy actions and immediate reaction by markets  and of the more general need in most countries to raise production capacity  and not to stimulate demand. In this environment  the appropriate role for monetary policy has been redefined as a responsibility for the creation and maintenance of stable financial conditions that will be reflected in low inflation. This is what central banks can do best to support governmental programmes for overall economic growth and development. BIS Review 108/1997 - 2 - In South Africa  considering the many attacks made on Reserve Bank policy during this past year  there is still a major lack of consensus on what the prime objective of monetary policy should be. Unless we can get consensus and support for the almost global approach of contemporary central bank policy  and unless we can agree to pursue these policies also in South Africa  the road to the internationalisation of the South African economy will be rough and difficult. 2. Challenge number two -- deciding on an appropriate framework for monetary policy Given the objective of price stability  each central bank must design a framework or a consistent model within which monetary policy can be implemented  taking account of the structure of the financial system and of the economy of the country. Various models are available to choose from  but whatever model is preferred  the final objective of monetary policy should always be the protection of the value of the currency. In the Bretton Woods system of fixed par values  the main intermediate objective of monetary policy was the protection of exchange rates  or the external value of the currency. By linking global exchange rates through fixed gold parities  there was a convergence of inflation  at a relatively low level  at least for the many countries that succeeded in maintaining fixed exchange rates over relatively long periods of time. Needless to say  the system broke down in the late 1960s and early 1970s when more expansionary monetary policies were followed by some of the major industrial countries  and inflation escalated. Today  some smaller countries still attach their exchange rates to a selected major international currency  and then accept the unavoidable consequence that the rate of inflation in the smaller country must converge with the rate of inflation in the economy of the anchor currency. A good example of this approach is provided by Argentina with its convertibility law of 1 Peso = 1 US dollar. A second widely-used model is the one of monetary targeting where an important monetary aggregate such as the money supply or the amount of bank credit extension is used as an anchor for monetary policy. Within the context of the prime monetary policy objective of maintaining low inflation  a monetary target (or exchange rate target) represents but an intermediate objective of the policy. South Africa is one of the many countries that introduced money supply targeting as an anchor for monetary policy during the course of the 1980s. Initially  the policy served the country well. It made an important contribution to a better understanding of policy decisions  and also made a major contribution towards the successful reduction in the level of the rate of inflation from an average of about 15 per cent over the twenty years from 1973 to 1992  to about 8½ per cent over the past four years. The South African experience with money supply targeting is not very different from those of other comparable countries such as Canada and Australia -- with the difference that the process in South Africa is a slower and lagged one  mainly because of the economic isolation of this country from the rest of the world up to 1993. Australia introduced money supply targets in 1976  and then abandoned them “with reluctance” in February 1985. At the time  Australia tendered two reasons for ending the M3-targeting stage: “The first was the problem of controllability. The fact that targets were often missed was an indication that close control was either not possible  or would have required undesirable movements in the policy instruments. The second was the instability of the BIS Review 108/1997 relationship between money supply and the ultimate objective of policy such as inflation ...”. (Address by Governor Macfarlane at a Conference of Economists in Hobart  29 September 1997.) It was Governor Gerald Bouey of Canada at the time who made the famous statement: “In Canada  we did not abandon money supply targets  they abandoned us”. In view of the liberalisation of the South African financial markets in recent years  the integration of the South African economy in the world financial markets and the increasing importance of large and volatile international capital flows  South Africa may have reached the same stage now where the usefulness of the M3-money supply as a target for monetary policy has been diluted to a point where some alternative anchor should be considered. Following the demise of money supply targeting during the mid 1980s  both Canada and Australia went through a transitional period which lasted until the early 1990s. During this transitional period a policy of “monetary pragmatism” was followed. There was indeed no formal or strictly defined framework to guide monetary policy. A “check-list” of an ad hoc mixture of intermediate objectives was introduced and the central bank was allowed a wide degree of discretion in the implementation of monetary policy. After the “rule” of monetary targeting broke down  the policy was “to look at everything”. Although such a pragmatic approach may have some advantages  particularly in an environment of major structural changes and volatile international shocks  it has the major disadvantage of not being transparent. As Charles Goodhart put it: “Supporters would describe it as sensible pragmatism  detractors as a reversion to a muddled discretion which  once again  allows the authorities more rope than is good for them  or us”. (The Conduct of Monetary Policy  Economic Journal 1989.) Both Australia and Canada  and a growing number of other countries  have recently moved to direct targeting of inflation. In all these countries  however  not only central banks but also governments commit themselves jointly with the central banks to a predetermined target for inflation. In the United Kingdom  the Chancellor of the Exchequer indeed sets the target for inflation in his Annual Budget  and then instructs the Bank of England to pursue the goal with its monetary policy instruments. Nowhere does the central bank on its own decide on an inflation target. For an inflation target to be credible  there must be a commitment at least of the central bank and the government  and  if possible  also of the business community and labour  to the achievement of the goal. Furthermore  it will do more harm than good for a country to introduce a formal inflation target that is much out of line with the rest of the world. Of the seven countries reported in the BIS Annual Report for 1996 with formal inflation targets  no one has set a goal for inflation of more than 3 per cent per annum. The central bank must be given sufficient operational autonomy to pursue the inflation target with vigour and without the fear of intimidation by politicians or other pressure groups. And  finally  markets must be free  flexible and responsive to underlying changes. Inflation is often a symptom of malfunctioning markets and the cure lies not with monetary policy  but with a restructuring of the markets. It is a big challenge for South Africa to prepare itself for this new age of direct inflation targeting as an anchor for monetary policy. The proposals made by the Reserve Bank last week for the introduction in March next year of a more flexible system of providing BIS Review 108/1997 - 4 - accommodation to banking institutions  represents an important further step on this road towards a more effective monetary policy system that will be compatible with global policies. 3. Challenge number three - establishing an effective institutional framework for monetary policy There is a lot of misunderstanding in South Africa about what is meant with the independence of the Reserve Bank. The Bank can never be made responsible for determining the overall macroeconomic policy objectives of the country. This is a prerogative of government. The central bank must  however  be given a clear mandate from government on what its policy objective should be  but should then be given the necessary autonomy to pursue and achieve this objective. Taking account of the powers and influences of central banks  the obvious directive by government to the monetary authority should be to protect the value of the currency in the interest of sustainable optimum economic growth and development in the longer term. To achieve this objective  a central bank must at times apply financial disciplines that are unpopular  will be opposed by pressure groups and are perceived to be against the interests of private sector profiteers  and political popularity. It is inter alia for this reason  and only in respect of the implementation of measures that may at times prove to be unpopular  that central banks should be given “independence” from governments. To quote once more from what a former Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia once said: “The Reserve Bank must be given all the freedom of the prison exercise yard”. (R.A. Johnston - “Comments on Professor Schedvin - Economic Papers - 1992.) Although this autonomy has been given to the South African Reserve Bank in terms of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa  the disciplinary actions applied by the Bank in the pursuance of its mandate are often challenged by economists  business people and politicians whenever they believe their vested interests are impeded by the actions. Many South Africans must still learn to be more tolerable towards the need of painful financial disciplines  when justified by adverse macroeconomic situations. These may often be forced on us by international developments over which we have no control. Apart from an effective institutional framework for the Reserve Bank  South Africa also needs well-managed private sector banking institutions  well-functioning financial markets and an effective clearing  settlement and payment arrangement for inter-bank transactions. The challenge is therefore not only to liberalise the South African financial sector further  but also to ensure good and prudent financial regulation  and to provide the country with a modern electronically-based national payment system. The new system to be introduced by the Reserve Bank in March 1998 for an improved clearing and settlement system will provide a further step on the road of preparing for an effective integration of the South African financial system in the global economy. The challenge for South Africa is not to isolate itself from the adverse effects of the globalisation process  but to continue to participate in the programme of gradual international integration. 4. The overriding challenge for monetary policy is to keep inflation low BIS Review 108/1997 Financial stability in South Africa is threatened from time to time by new and more intensive inflationary pressures. We have not yet succeeded in suppressing the prevailing inflation psychosis in this country. Expectations at this juncture may have settled around the 8 per cent per annum level  which is about half of what it used to be at the beginning of this decade. But this is still about three times the amount of actual inflation in the economies of our major trading partners. The process of globalisation unavoidably leads to a convergence of the major financial aggregates such as inflation  real rates of interest and budget deficits. South Africa will either continue to be part of the globalisation process  together with its inevitable convergence effects  or will be marginalised and excluded from the advantages of being part of the world-wide process. In this period of transition from monetary policy targeting to the introduction of a national inflation objective  monetary policy must continue to maintain overall financial stability. This is essential in order to buy time while other policies (as proposed in GEAR) are put in place to handle the more deep-seated structural deficiencies that must be corrected before South Africa will be able to experience optimum economic growth with financial stability. 5. Conclusion and summary The challenges facing monetary policy in South Africa at this stage can be summarised as follows: We must convince more South Africans that the one and only task for monetary policy must be to protect the value of the currency. We must adapt monetary policy to the changing environment in which we now have to operate. This may require of us to move away from money supply targeting and to adopt a more direct focus on inflation developments. We must guard against growing pressures in our country for the curtailment of the autonomy of the central bank. The Reserve Bank must continue to guide the South African financial markets into the world financial system. This will require further progress in the gradual elimination of exchange control  the modernisation of the payments system  the encouragement of the development of more efficient markets and  in the context of Africa  support for co-operation and the Southern Africa Development Community. integration of financial markets within The overriding challenge remains to bring inflation in South Africa to a lower level that will be more in line with the average rate of inflation of our major trading partners. This will require a sound monetary policy approach  based on realistic (but not necessarily low) interest rates; a stable (but not necessarily fixed) exchange rate; a sound (but not necessarily protected) banking sector  and effective and well-functioning financial markets.

Introduction It’s a great pleasure to be here today to share some thoughts with you on the global financial marketplace  and its implications for New Zealand. We have recently had a dramatic example of how events in one country can spread rapidly. The recent share market collapse that began in Hong Kong and spread to equity markets around the world  including New Zealand  illustrates just how integrated global financial markets have become. Designing and implementing an effective financial policy in pursuit of national goals  in a world of highly integrated capital markets  is one of the most topical and challenging tasks in central banking today. To keep my presentation today within manageable bounds  and reflecting my professional interest  I will constrain my comments to one of the important functions of a central bank  namely  the preservation of stability in the financial system. Our focus at the Reserve Bank is on promoting the maintenance of a sound and efficient financial system in New Zealand. This focus involves establishing a policy environment to counteract the possibility of contagious spread of financial distress  and in particular is aimed at encouraging prudent bank behaviour. I will begin by sketching out some of the key trends in global finance  and will then describe the international regulatory response to these developments. Along the way  I will tease out the implications for New Zealand  and test our approach to banking supervision against these global developments. I will conclude with some crystal ball gazing. Trends in the global financial marketplace Let me begin then with some observations on the rapidly changing global financial marketplace. It is now a commonplace that barriers between countries and financial markets  at least in developed countries  have largely disappeared  and this fact  together with new technologies  new financial instruments and new funding techniques  means that financial intermediation is increasingly global. Fundamental to this trend has been the way in which advances in computer and communications technology have reduced the costs of cross-border transactions by lowering the costs of collecting and analysing data  undertaking transactions  clearing and settling payments and monitoring financial flows. And the cost reductions have been very dramatic. A recent article in The Economist noted that “the cost of a three-minute telephone call between London and New York has fallen from US$300 (in 1996 dollars) in 1930 to US$1 today”. The same article stated that “the cost of computer processing power has been falling by an average of 30 percent a year in real terms over the past couple of decades”. Such trends allow both the users of financial services and financial institutions themselves to look to global solutions to meet their financial needs. Funds can now be raised and invested  currencies exchanged  and financial risk positions changed around the world at almost anytime. BIS Review 108/1997 - 2 - Contributing to the globalisation of finance has been the rapid trend towards financial market liberalisation. This has seen country after country freeing up their financial system. In that process  exchange controls (that had been intended to isolate domestic markets from global influences) have been dismantled. In the increasingly integrated global capital market that has resulted  global financial firms with often complex financial and corporate structures have emerged as dominant players. These firms are to be found operating around the globe -- relatively low transaction costs and the application of new technologies allow such firms to be active players in whichever of the world’s financial markets they want to participate in. Distinctions between different types of financial institutions are breaking down as a result of the growth of these conglomerate structures  the relaxation in regulatory constraints  and the way in which derivatives can be used to transform the risk characteristics of institutions’ portfolios. A related development is that the risk management practices of global financial increasingly centralised as competitive pressures drive financial firms are becoming organisations seeking the highest risk-adjusted returns for shareholders. With the processing power of modern computers  it is now possible for the risk and return characteristics of large and complex portfolios to be managed centrally and  if not real time  at least on an intra-day basis. Virtually all large bank holding companies are now operated and managed as integrated units. This trend towards centralised risk management raises some fundamental policy issues as to how best to regulate and supervise such large and complex banking organisations. Product innovation has gone hand in hand with liberalisation. One of the more significant developments has been the emergence of derivatives such as financial futures  swaps and options. The total risk of more traditional financial products has been broken into component parts and repackaged into synthetic products that have risk profiles similar to other financial instruments. The synthetic products can then be sold to those domestic and global investors willing and able to bear the associated risks. Such products are now used extensively throughout the world to help firms manage the exposure to interest rate and exchange rate movements that occur in liberalised financial markets. And innovation is ongoing  as is evident with the increasing application of derivatives to credit risk. The rapid globalisation of finance is well illustrated by the phenomenal growth in cross-border financial activity. An April 1995 survey by the Bank for International Settlements estimated that an average of US$1.2 trillion flowed through the world’s foreign exchange markets each day  up 45% on three years earlier. Estimated turnover of over-the-counter derivatives on an average day was US$880 billion  70% of which involved transactions with counterparties in different countries. An article in Institutional Investor in August 1997 provides another illustration of the magnitude of cross-border finance -- “nearly US$150 billion of net new private capital poured into the main Latin American and Asian economies in 1996  almost double the 1995 level”. These numbers are enormous however you want to look at them. New sources of systemic risk The globalisation of finance  the liberalisation of financial markets and rapid technological change have opened up new opportunities in commerce for achieving economies of scale  and facilitating the international rationalisation of production and distribution. The resulting benefits include productivity growth and improving living standards. Innovations like derivatives improve the efficiency of financial markets. New technology allows sophisticated BIS Review 108/1997 management information and control systems  and the application of complex analytical models to help institutions manage risks more effectively. But while considerable benefits flow from such developments  they also inevitably bring with them new risks. One of the most important from a central banker’s perspective is the introduction of new sources of risk to the stability of the financial system: • Liberalisation and globalisation bring competition  which squeezes out the rents created by previously protected markets. This produces efficiency gains but it also means that financial institutions in the new environment have less of a buffer of protected profits and are therefore more vulnerable to distress caused by either mismanagement or misfortune. • Derivatives bring new risks in that they can expose financial institutions to greater leverage  thereby allowing for shocks to be amplified. In addition  they increase the linkages between national financial markets  which means that adverse events are quickly transmitted from one market to another. • Furthermore  market participants can now react very rapidly to a problem in a particular country  or even a perceived problem. Capital can move rapidly and in large volumes. Again  a disturbance in one country can now flow rapidly to other countries with the result that other countries’ financial systems  and the international financial system more generally  are arguably more exposed to disturbance than before globalisation. In the light of these increased risks  it is worth recalling that there have been relatively frequent episodes of national financial instability over the past couple of decades. Since 1980  over two-thirds of IMF member countries have experienced at least one serious banking-sector difficulty. And  in more than 65 emerging country cases  bank losses nearly or completely exhausted the banking system’s capital. In more than a dozen countries in the emerging markets of Asia  Latin America and Eastern Europe  financial collapses have required budgetary expenditure of more than 10% of GDP to resolve. Some industrial countries have also experienced major financial problems over the same period. The list includes the United States  Japan  France  Sweden  Finland  Norway and Spain. In Sweden  for example  18% of bank loans were lost between 1990 and 1993 with two of the largest banks being bailed out by the state. These and more recent episodes of bank distress  such as Mexico and Thailand  suggest that there is no evidence that financial sector fragility is reducing with time. While New Zealand has not experienced bank problems of the magnitude that I have just described  there have nevertheless been occasions of serious bank distress. In 1989-90  the Bank of New Zealand (which was government-owned at the time) had to be re-capitalised twice by the Government  at a total cost of about 3% of government expenditure. NZI Bank would certainly have failed had it not been re-capitalised by its parent in Scotland. A very significant non-bank financial institution  the DFC  was placed in statutory management in 1989 when it became insolvent. A national financial crisis can not only have a severely adverse impact on the economy of the country directly concerned  it may also threaten the stability of the international financial system. A recent example was Mexico in early 1995. A build up of short-term US dollar-linked debt  combined with the devaluation of the peso and a sharp rise in interest rates  undermined the solvency of most of the Mexican banking system and resulted in a liquidity crisis. International investors shifted their claims away not just from Mexico  but also from other countries where similar weaknesses were suspected. BIS Review 108/1997 - 4 - Instability in the international financial system can arise not only from the transmission of a national problem but also from a breakdown in the normal functioning of critical financial interconnections between countries. What I have in mind here are the payments and settlements processes that link national financial systems. This is not a new source of risk  and the best known illustration of the problem was the failure of Bankhaus Herstatt in 1974. This small German bank was active in the foreign exchange market. It defaulted after receiving Deutsche Marks from international banks but before the matching US dollar leg was processed later in the day. This left its counterparties exposed to the full value of the Deutsche Marks delivered. This event severely disrupted CHIPS  the main clearing system for US dollars  led to a collapse in trading in the US dollar/Deutsche Mark market and even resulted in disorder in the inter-bank money markets. The circumstance that led to Herstatt risk is still present today  namely the time lapse between the payment and receipt of currencies in foreign exchange transactions. What is different now is the exponential growth that has occurred in foreign exchange transactions since 1974. In the late 1990s  if a major international bank were unable to meet its obligations in settling an average day’s foreign exchange transactions  it would have serious ramifications for the stability of the international financial system  as well for domestic financial markets. Globalisation of finance to date has been most marked in wholesale business. But technology in the form of the Internet is now beginning to allow for retail products to be advertised and sold from anywhere in the world  and paid for electronically by anyone in any other country. There seems little doubt that  when our next conference on financial services is held  this trend to the globalisation of retail financial services will be an important theme. In any event  there is no doubt that finance is now global. Nor is there any doubt that new sources of systemic risk have emerged from the liberalisation of financial markets  from the increased size and greater complexity of institutions  from the greater complexity of some of the new financial instruments  from the greater volume and speed of transactions  and from the increased involvement in the global financial system of national banking systems which are themselves suffering considerable strains. It is probably fair to conclude that  while the threat of serious disruption to the international financial system remains relatively small  should serious disruption occur it could have disastrous consequences for living standards around the world. Regulatory response Faced with these new sources of risk  the objective of safeguarding the soundness of financial systems has become a top policy priority both nationally and internationally. Most obviously  the trend towards large and complex global financial institutions  centralised risk management and the blurring of boundaries between different types of financial institutions is leading to a change in regulatory structures. Generalising somewhat  the traditional approach to regulating the financial industry was for there to be a bank regulator  a securities industry regulator  an insurance industry regulator and so on. This decentralised approach to regulation was seen as being appropriate when institutions were clearly delineated and decision-making was decentralised. However  in today’s world of conglomerate financial institutions where decision-making and risk management are centralised  the traditional regulatory approach is seen as being inadequate BIS Review 108/1997 by many countries. Exposure of a bank to potential risk  for instance  cannot be evaluated independently of the condition and management policies of any conglomerate to which the bank belongs. Whereas efforts have been made in some countries to co-ordinate and exchange information between different kinds of supervisors  in other countries the supervisory structure has been changed so that all financial institutions are supervised by one “umbrella-type” supervisory body. Recent developments in this direction have been seen in Australia  with the Australian Government adopting the recommendations of the Wallis Inquiry. This will see the establishment of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to oversee all financial institutions in Australia. Similarly  the new United Kingdom Government has decided to establish a new “super-regulator” that will bring together nine financial regulators in one organisation. New Zealand’s regulatory approach Given that the banking industry in New Zealand has always been dominated by foreign-owned banks  particularly from Australia and the United Kingdom  any development that makes supervision of the parent bank more effective is welcomed by us. From the Reserve Bank’s perspective  though  we have not seen a pressing need to change our regulatory structures in a similar way. The reasons for this are two-fold. First  we take a rather different approach to promoting financial system stability  an approach which relies less on direct regulation and more on the use of market disciplines and the internal incentives for banks to behave prudently (I will return to this shortly). Secondly  we see our present regulatory structure as being effective. Over recent years  our regulatory structure has been closely aligned to a public policy approach that recognises that open and competitive financial markets are desirable. Within this  all of the key areas where private sector failure may occur have been covered in a way that meets our circumstances. Hence  the Reserve Bank is responsible for the maintenance of the financial system’s soundness and efficiency  with our attention focused on the banking sector  where any systemic problems  if they were to occur  would arise. The Commerce Commission has responsibility for protecting the consumer against exploitation and unfair trading. And the Securities Commission is focused on improving the efficiency and fairness of the markets for securities (widely defined) of entities that raise funds in New Zealand. This approach recognises that in New Zealand systemic issues are central in the supervision of banks  whereas in non-bank financial services consumer-protection issues are more important. There has been a strong presumption in economic policy development in New Zealand over the last decade or so that market forces generally produce better outcomes than those arising from bureaucratic rules and regulations. Our approach to banking supervision reflects this. We start with the presumption that financial markets contain powerful and flexible disciplinary mechanisms for rewarding good bank performance and penalising imprudent bank behaviour. Given the widespread public belief in most countries that “governments never allow banks to fail”  we do not argue that market forces alone will do the job  but we do see the disciplines of the market as being the dominant and most effective means BIS Review 108/1997 - 6 - for promoting a robust financial system. There are three key elements in our market-based approach to banking supervision. • The first is to ensure that the marketplace has sufficient and reliable information on banks on which to base financial assessments and decisions. This is achieved through a public disclosure regime which requires banks to publish a comprehensive range of financial  corporate and risk-related information for the bank and its banking group at quarterly intervals. • The second important element is to promote market discipline by ensuring that government policy supports  or at least does not impede  the development of active inter-bank markets  the diversification of funding instruments and sources  the development of institutional investors and the entry of sophisticated foreign players to the financial market. The rationale is that professional players are the market’s strongest disciplinary force. • The third key element has been to strengthen the incentives for the directors and management of banks to manage their banks’ affairs in a sound and responsible manner. An important aspect of this is a requirement for the directors of banks to attest to the accuracy of the information in the quarterly disclosure statements  to the fact that their banks have satisfactory risk management policies and to the fact that these are being properly applied. This approach  of harnessing market forces and using improved internal governance to promote financial system soundness  is gaining some support in the international supervisory community  and among academics. This can be highlighted by recent comments from three prominent and highly respected individuals. “As financial transactions become increasingly rapid and complex  I believe we have no choice but to harness market forces  as best we can  to reinforce our supervisory objectives. The appeal of market-led discipline lies not only in its cost effectiveness and flexibility  but also in its limited intrusiveness and its greater adaptability to changing financial environments. Measures to enhance market discipline involve providing private investors the incentives and the means to reward good bank performance and penalise poor performance. Expanded risk management disclosures by financial institutions is a significant step in this direction.” Alan Greenspan  May 1997.1 “For major banks in industrial countries ..... there needs to be a shift of emphasis towards the re-inforcement of internal managerial risk-control mechanisms  and a recasting of the nature and functions of external regulation  away from generalised rule-setting and towards establishing incentives/sanctions which reinforce such internal control mechanisms.” Charles Goodhart  June 1997.2 “Much recent thinking has focused on incentive-compatible regulation -- using the market’s own internal forces -- as the promising next step for strengthening the financial system. It is 1 Remarks by the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  Mr Alan Greenspan  at the Conference on Bank Structure and Competition of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago on 1 May 1997. 2 From “Financial Regulation: Why  How and Where Now?” Charles A.E. Goodhart et al  6 June 1997. (Charles Goodhart was for many years at the Bank of England and is now Deputy Director and Norman Sosnow Professor of Banking and Finance at the London School of Economics.) BIS Review 108/1997 banks’ shareholders and management that have the strongest interest to measure risk accurately.” Andrew Crockett  September 1997.3 To illustrate the evolution that is taking place in supervision  let me cite one example. In a recent initiative by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision to amend the Capital Accord to include market risk  a greater role has been given to banks’ own internal models in the measurement of market risk. This reflects a move away from regulation that relies on detailed rules to an approach that places more emphasis on the adequacy of internal risk control mechanisms. Such an approach recognises that it is bank directors and management that have the strongest interest and ability to measure risk accurately  and that an internally-generated measure of risk should be better than one derived from that imposed by supervisors. The ongoing challenge to regulators is to ensure that incentive structures are conducive to this outcome. My own perspective is that a paradigm shift in supervision towards harnessing market forces will make a more significant contribution to promoting sound and efficient financial systems than simply changing regulatory structures within the same external regulation paradigm. Although it is far too early to make conclusive assessments of the success or otherwise of our new supervisory approach (which has now been in operation for nearly two years)  I am satisfied that it is encouraging prudent behaviour by banks in New Zealand  and thereby is reducing the likelihood of financial system instability in the future. Moreover  I am confident that it is doing this at lower efficiency  compliance and taxpayer costs than other supervisory options might be expected to achieve. Payments system reform So far  I have discussed the regulatory response to the globalisation of finance in terms of the health of the individual institutions that make up the financial system. Of equal significance to financial stability in this new environment is how resilient payment and settlement systems are  both domestically and internationally. In common with most central banks around the world  we have been devoting considerable attention to payments system reform. Our main focus to date has been developing a real time gross settlement system for large-value transactions between banks. Until quite recently  the standard form of settlement was end-of-day net settlement: all payments and receipts between banks were allowed to accumulate during the day  to be settled by transfer of the very much smaller net amount at the end of the day. The risk of this form of settlement is that it usually requires participants to grant unsecured and unlimited credit to other participants during the period until final settlement occurs. Credit extended to a single counterparty can in some cases exceed a bank’s entire capital. One important solution which has been implemented in some countries  and which we have as a high priority to implement within the next few months in New Zealand  is the replacement of this traditional end-of-day settlement arrangement with an RTGS system. Individual transactions under RTGS are settled one-by-one during the day rather than being allowed to accumulate  thereby removing the very large exposures that can 3 Speech by the General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements  Mr Andrew Crockett  at the Money  Macro and Finance Conference held in Durham on 11 September 1997. BIS Review 108/1997 - 8 - build up between banks. Once implemented  RTGS will be a significant milestone in the reduction of domestic payment system risks. Another important initiative that we are promoting to reduce systemic risk is to make bilateral and multilateral netting arrangements for certain transactions legally binding. With legally enforceable netting arrangements in place  the various “gross” obligations to make payments can be offset against one another  and it is only the net amounts due which are called into question in the event of a bank failure. Our attention is also being actively focused on dealing with settlement risk in cross-border foreign exchange transactions. As already noted  the value of foreign exchange deals that are now being settled is so substantial that the resulting settlement risks can be of a size to cause systemic concern for both national and international financial systems. This risk  mentioned earlier in my presentation  is often referred to as Herstatt risk. As in New Zealand  much international attention is currently being focused on this problem. Co-operation amongst supervisors My final comments on the response of regulators to global financial trends concern the co-operation among supervisors and international agencies to address the potential for systemic disruption. These efforts have gained momentum over the last decade as the inherent tension between nationally-based regulatory structures and an increasingly globalised financial sector has become apparent. Co-operation among bank supervisors under the auspices of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision has produced a number of important agreements on the supervision of banks  including minimum capital standards and minimum standards governing the supervision of banks’ cross-border establishments. Similarly other supervisors  such as the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS)  have pursued co-operation in their areas of responsibility. And in the early 1990s  in recognition of the emergence and growth of financial conglomerates  banking  securities and insurance supervisors from G-10 countries began to work together to identify problems that conglomerates can cause and to consider ways to overcome them. The Mexican crisis in 1995 in particular  and the widespread incidence and high cost of banking problems more generally  have prompted calls for concerted international action to promote the soundness of financial systems. These calls have strengthened over the last couple of years with the G-7 countries calling for “the adoption of strong prudential standards in emerging countries” and encouraging the international financial institutions to “increase their efforts to promote effective supervisory structures in these economies”. The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision has been at the forefront of this effort over the past year with the release of its Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. These principles have quickly become the focal point for the increased efforts to strengthen financial sectors around the world. Also aiming at more effective bank supervision  the IMF is making the evaluation of financial supervision and regulation part of its annual country reviews  and the World Bank is emphasising the strengthening of financial infrastructure as an important part of its structural assistance programmes. BIS Review 108/1997 A comment on the international supervisory response While the international regulatory response has many positive elements  to me it has not always been appropriately focused. Often following a crisis  there are calls to “strengthen supervision”. For various reasons  I feel that these calls  or the ways in which they have been answered  have not always been well directed. Let me briefly elaborate on why I think this. At both the national and the international levels  the nature of the policy response to a crisis needs to be based on a careful analysis of the “problem”. It is certainly clear from the record that there have been significant weaknesses in some countries’ banking systems  and that these weaknesses have both contributed to the emergence and severity of financial crises and complicated the task of resolving them. However  I am somewhat sceptical of the general proposition that “poor supervision” has been the primary cause of these weaknesses. There has been a tendency to give supervision the “blame” for problems which have originated elsewhere  and/or to seek supervisory remedies for problems which might well be better solved in other ways. I would note further that “supervision” (in its general sense) has sometimes been part of the “problem” rather than part of the “solution” -- particularly when it has involved excessive forbearance by the regulatory authorities  and/or excessive reliance on the public safety net. I think it important that we supervisors should be appropriately modest about what we can achieve  and supervision should not be seen as an assured remedy for all potential problems. Establishing price stability and a sustainable fiscal position are also critical elements in the pursuit of sound financial systems. While weakness in the financial system can have macroeconomic true -- unsound macroeconomic policies can have long-lasting effects that lead to weakness in financial systems. Excessive credit creation and inflation are obvious examples. Some observers have suggested that virtually every major financial system problem in the last two or three decades was caused  directly or indirectly  by unsound macroeconomic policies. is also undoubtedly implications  the reverse Some of the international regulatory responses also do not sufficiently recognise that the objectives of bank supervision  and the infrastructure within which supervision takes place (for example  the quality of company law  accounting standards  and external auditors)  are not the same in all countries. To have any chance of being successful  international initiatives will need to be flexible enough to suit this wide variety of national circumstances. For emerging countries where the banking infrastructure may not be well developed  it may well be sensible to actively pursue financial stability through improving the quality of prescriptive rules. In this regard  the initiative by the Basle Committee to establish an international standard of core principles for effective supervision may be helpful. But regulators in many developed countries are finding that the complexity of banking  the blurring of functional dividing lines amongst financial institutions  globalisation  and the speed of portfolio adjustment are making external regulation based on standard rules less effective and less feasible. This is resulting in an increasing emphasis being placed on internal risk management processes and in harnessing market disciplines to promote prudent banking behaviour. What this suggests to me is that the regulatory approach followed by a particular country will need to fully reflect its own circumstances. Attempting to apply a “one-size-fits-all” approach to all countries is likely to be ineffective  and may even be counterproductive. BIS Review 108/1997 - 10 - The Future So  what do I see as being the likely issues of the future? What is certain is that the future will surprise us! But some things seem likely. Innovation in the financial sector will continue  as will the integration of the world’s financial markets. Using market disciplines to strengthen the financial system also seems likely to grow in relative importance. New Zealand’s approach to promoting financial system stability is entirely consistent with the global trends that I have described and  in particular  with the “incentive-compatible” approach to regulation. It seems absolutely appropriate for our circumstances. There will inevitably need to be refinements made to our regulatory approach from time to time  but I believe that the principles on which it has been established  and its basic design  are soundly based and will remain so for the foreseeable future. At some point in the future the “special” status of banks in the New Zealand supervisory approach may need to be reassessed. This might be prompted by the continued gradual breaking down of the traditional distinction between banks and non-banks in financial intermediation  or perhaps by banking services being provided in New Zealand by institutions not physically located here. It may also be prompted by a risk-proofing of payments and settlements systems that effectively prevents the problems of one bank contagiously spreading to others. Concerns about financial system stability might ultimately be best addressed by designing a supervisory framework that is focused on those systems themselves rather than on the main institutions. For the foreseeable future  though  concerns about financial system soundness in New Zealand are likely to continue to be focused on the banking system  as it is here that systemic risks are likely to remain concentrated.

I am very honoured to be invited today to address this distinguished Conference. The title of my paper is “Asset Prices  Capital Flows and Risk Management”. All these factors have been the main players in the recent market turbulence in the region. I will therefore focus my discussion today on the lessons from the recent Asian market turmoil and also the impact on Hong Kong. The Surge in Capital Flows 2. In the past decade  capital flows surged within the Asian region and globally. According to IMF statistics  average annual net capital inflows to developing countries exceeded US$150 billion in 1990-96  and more than 40% of which actually came to Asia. In the last two years we saw even more capital inflows to the region  recording a net total of US$107 billion in 1996 and a similar growth rate in the first half of 1997. In some Asian economies  net inflows have averaged 5-8% of GDP over long periods  with over half of such capital flows in the form of foreign direct investment. 3. The growth in international capital flows is the result of greater financial liberalization and sophistication in markets around the world  the rise of institutional investors such as mutual and pension funds  and growing financial innovation and intermediation  especially in derivative products. We all know that capital movements help growth through a more global efficient allocation of resources and bring new knowledge and technology to emerging economies. 4. On the other hand  international capital flows can be very volatile in nature  with the tendency of reversing direction when there is the slightest hint of risk  whether it is in the conduct of macroeconomic policies or concerns over the fragility of the financial sector. Capital flows now drive the balance of payments more than trade flows. Portfolio shifts operate on the basis of market expectations of risk  return and liquidity. A high level of arbitraging  such as the borrowing of funds from one market to invest in another market  leads to contagion effects. Losses in one market therefore result in sales in another. This is a risk that should be addressed not only by those who are now under the process of capital liberalization  but also by the whole international community. Global markets mean global contagion. This is no longer a uniquely Asian problem. 5. Let us now consider the recent Asian market turbulence in the global context. Until recently  Asia enjoyed the benefits of the high global liquidity  and recorded admirable levels of capital inflows  as driven by the high global liquidity in G-3 economies. Indeed  high global liquidity is also the consequence of strong productivity growth  low inflation and improved government savings  especially in the United States  which has resulted in the strongest growth in world trade in decades. 6. With well-behaved inflation  the ample international liquidity has resulted in a global stock market boom in the 1990s  in both Europe and the US  as well as emerging markets in Latin America and Eastern Europe. But this has also caused a global compression of interest rate spreads and record levels of new issuance in both domestic and international bond markets. Such narrowing of spreads did not reflect the potential credit and market risks associated with the emerging markets. So when investors finally realize that the emerging markets are carrying more risks than they have assumed  the risk premium as measured by the yield spreads will widen sharply to reflect this. BIS Review 109/1997 - 2 - 7. This scenario was complicated by the fact that the flood of global liquidity has been largely channelled to the bond  equity and property markets of East Asia. Buoyed by optimism about the Asian miracle growth of the last decade  both domestic and foreign investors committed the classic “fallacy of composition”. Initially  each individual may perceive a high return and increase their investments in assets  leading in aggregate to excess demand and a market overshoot. A reversal of perception leads to a sharp market correction  which is exactly what is happening not only in Asia  but globally. As Chairman Greenspan said recently  ""in retrospect  it is clear that more investment monies flowed into these economies than could be profitably employed at modest risk"". 8. The strong Asian growth would have continued but for the fact that global competition in external trade has emerged with newly industrialized and export-oriented economies with cheap labour  such as China  India  Latin American and Eastern Europe. The failure of central planning has brought at least three billion new workers and consumers into the global market. These new markets began to benefit from the growing trade liberalization and inflows of foreign investments  thus putting greater pressure on the markets of the earlier “tigers” of East Asia  leading to a widening of their current account deficits as they continued their investments in infrastructure and real estate. Issues in Asia 9. If we look more closely at the situation in Asia  the economic fundamentals remain intact. Asia has been the fastest-growing region in the world  recording growth rates of around 5%-9%. Asian economies have low inflation rates and exchange rates were stable until recently. Current account for the region as a whole is broadly in balance  while the fiscal account  excluding Japan  is in surplus. Asia has exceptionally high savings rates of above 30% of GDP. Official savings  in terms of foreign currency reserves  were even higher. In Asia  70% of the inflows contributed to reserve accumulation. As a result  Asian central banks are now holding about 40% of the world’s foreign exchange reserves. Five of the top six foreign exchange holders in the world are now Asians. 10. The strong fundamentals -- a young  educated  flexible workforce  stable government  good natural resources and communications infrastructure  openness to trade and innovation  and high savings and investment rates -- these have not basically changed. Asia is still outward-looking  with open markets and openness to technology and innovation. The aspirations of Asia are also real: an entrepreneurial approach to innovation  competition and better standards of living for the rising urban population. Where Asians have perhaps kept their eyes off the ball is the need to develop the services sector in complementary step with the manufacturing or export sectors. Delays in opening the financial sectors to global competition make them vulnerable to real sector excesses or imbalances  such as the overconcentration of risks in certain areas  including the asset markets. 11. The momentum of growth depends critically on continued vigorous trade reform  fiscal prudence and improvements in finance  health and education policies. Increasingly  exports are changing from labour-intensive industrial production  and more toward higher value-added industries and services. This poses the challenge of sustaining productivity growth. 12. The Asian turmoil being a financial turmoil on the surface  let me focus on the interesting way Asia recycles its surplus savings. As my colleague Joseph Yam has consistently pointed out  a large portion of Asian foreign exchange reserves is invested in assets of the OECD countries  which provides safe and liquid instruments. These funds return to the region in the form of foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment. This global recycling also exposes Asian economies to volatile portfolio adjustments due to policy mistakes or shifts in the international economic environment. Currently  there are no deep  liquid and mature debt markets in Asia for the BIS Review 109/1997 intermediation process to function more efficiently. The process has begun in the last few years  and with the building of better financial infrastructure  this round of turmoil should add greater impetus to greater cooperation in building better regional financial intermediation. 13. As we all can see in hindsight  the risks involved in international capital flows are exacerbated when short-term capital flows are all attracted to the asset markets. This has led to asset bubbles  with all the painful consequences of asset price deflation. 14. But what is much more evident in Asia is that the process of hedging  arbitrage and “carry trade”  whereby arbitrageurs borrow in one market and invest in another market that offers higher interest rates  has created both regional and global contagion. Portfolio shifts mean that when asset prices change (and in this I would include: consumer prices  interest rates  exchange rates  debt and equity prices and property prices) funds will flow in and out to follow the “law of one price”. This suggests that open economies must adjust to global prices. The speed of such adjustments is only determined by the degree of openness of the domestic economy and financial markets. In other words  whether we like it or not  we are being priced globally by the market. 15. Many of us have not fully appreciated the full logic of this. The financial turmoil suggests that while the real sector causes of the stress is global competition  the financial effect is stress on domestic banking systems  as the banks intermediate the global portfolio adjustments. In an open economy  capital inflows will increase the deposit base of domestic banks which may be channelled through credit mistakes into fuelling domestic asset price bubbles. There are two implications. First  asset price inflation eventually feeds into domestic inflation and erodes external competitiveness. Second  excessive lending concentration into less productive assets  either real estate or over-investment in infrastructure and production capacity  exposes the financial institutions to huge risks. 16. From the viewpoint of financial intermediation  there are three major risks in Asia that underlie the shocks there: • First  maturity mismatch -- Asian markets made the mistake of borrowing short-term capital flows to finance illiquid non-tradables  such as property  thus exposing themselves to huge liquidity needs when capital flows reversed. • Second  currency mismatch -- corporations who borrowed foreign currency funds to finance investments that do not generate sufficient foreign exchange to repay the debt run a currency mismatch. • Third  credit risk -- lending or investments ultimately must be against sound profits that generate long-term returns higher than the borrowing rate or prospective dividends. Undue exuberance on the part of investors  when price-earning ratios grow beyond fundamentals  or on the part of bankers who failed to assess the impact of high interest rates on collateral or cash flows  would expose both the investor and the lender to asset losses. 17. Specifically  banks in Asia  having easier access to funds as a result of high global liquidity  were able to expand lending much more quickly and  thereby  incurred higher risks in their portfolios that they need to manage more soundly. Ironically  domestic banks may have been induced to move into more risky lending due to increased competition in the form of new entrants and financial intermediation. There is no question that they need to manage these new risks better. 18. There is also one distinguishing feature of the Asian turmoil. The debt problems have not been those of the public sector. On the contrary  the fiscal positions of Asian governments have by and large been quite sound. East Asia  excluding Japan  ran a fiscal surplus of US$5.4 billion BIS Review 109/1997 - 4 - or 0.1% of GDP in 1996. The debt burden  in fact  has been largely one of private sector overborrowing. The resolution of the debt of the private sector makes the Asian problems quite different from the experience of the sovereign debt issues of the 1980s. 19. In essence  the Asian problem is the age-old question of efficient resource allocation. Asia has no shortage of funds  only that its high level of savings are invested in less liquid long-term investments. Thus  one of the more pressing issues in Asia is to build a more competitive  stable financial system and a robust infrastructure to facilitate efficient financial intermediation. The better risk management of the financial system would also assist both corporations and investors to manage also their risks better. Ultimately  a balanced and flexible economy with sound risk management will then be in a better position to withstand global shocks and avoid crisis. The need for national risk management 20. We are all aware of the complexities of risks in financial markets. Aside from credit risks  market risks such as interest rate  exchange rate  legal risks  operational risks and systemic risks all have to be managed  both at the micro level and at the macro level. All markets suffer from the “fallacy of composition”. Mistakes at the corporate or bank level will add up to national mistakes  which now may add up to regional or international crisis through contagion. Traditional risk management at corporate or sectoral level simply shift risks from one sector to another. Risks still remain in the economy as a whole. Thus  increasingly in the 1980s  there emerged the awareness that financial sector regulation was all about national risk management. 21. National risk management covers six major aspects: • Credible policies  with monetary and fiscal policies consistent with each other  and applied consistently. • Capital account liberalization should be phased appropriately. • Sound fundamentals include a high domestic savings rate  sustainable fiscal and balance of payments positions  high foreign exchange reserves and prudent debt management. • Good supervision involves the maintenance of solid capital adequacy and liquidity requirements for the financial sector  as well as regular examination and monitoring of financial institutions and markets. The banking system must have the capacity to avoid excessive credit concentrations and risks  and to manage market risks well. • A robust financial infrastructure would encompass an efficient payments and settlements system for domestic and international transactions. In essence  the world is moving towards Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system  which support Delivery vs. Payment (DvP) and Payment vs. Payment (PvP). RTGS reduces payment risks and allows central banks to monitor flows in domestic currency as well as exposure of banks on a real time basis. • A non-distortive incentive structure  such as taxation or regulatory restrictions that would not encourage risk concentrations or excessive leverage in any economic sectors. 22. Put simply  managing national risks is equivalent to achieving three objectives. First  lower national gearing  because leveraging adds risks  especially if this is leveraged from external borrowing. The more you borrow abroad  the more you become vulnerable to external shocks. Second  the higher the level of domestic savings  which should be reflected in higher bank capital  lower credit/GDP ratio  and higher fiscal surpluses  the greater the resilience to the pain of adjustment to external or internal shocks. Third  irrespective of the exchange rate regime  there must BIS Review 109/1997 be a commitment to a stable currency  and this means strong external reserves  low inflation and a sound banking system. Asset prices and the exchange rate regime 23. The Asian market turmoil also raises the question as to whether the exchange rate regime matters. I believe the debate about whether the nominal exchange rate should be floating or fixed misses the point in Asia. The real issue is the real effective exchange rate of the economy  namely  its underlying productivity and global competitiveness. 24. For example  there is a mistaken perception that fixed exchange rates give rise to asset bubbles. But if you look at the recent evidence of asset price bubbles in advanced economies  asset price bubbles also occurred in the 1980s in countries with flexible exchange rates  such as Japan  Scandinavia and the United Kingdom. Asset price appreciation cannot be tackled alone by interest rates  since there are multiple reasons for such appreciation 25. In Asia  we can perhaps identify four main reasons: • First  the Asian household has always looked upon house ownership not only as a social necessity  but also as the best hedge against inflation. • Second  Asia is a young market  experiencing a high rate of urbanization. The strong demand for housing arising from demographics alone will fairly quickly eliminate excess capacity in many economies. • Third  housing supply constraints also gave rise to high housing costs. Examples are inadequate supply of land  excessive tax burden on housing and construction  and inefficient urban planning and approval procedures that delay market responses to the rising demand for housing. Over-rapid liberalization of supply constraints were also one reason for the emergence of excess supply. • Fourth  the high global liquidity that appeared has improved access to funds  which resulted in excessive exuberance on asset price inflation. The Impact on Hong Kong 26. Amidst the recent attacks to the regional currency markets  no economy in Asia has been totally immune  not least Hong Kong  despite the strong fundamentals. 27. If we identify the real issues in Asia as one of structural competitiveness in the global economy  caused by shifts in global resources and rising productivity outside the region  then structural adjustment must come through changes in either the internal price or the external price. With a fixed exchange rate regime and therefore a fixed external price  such as in Hong Kong  the adjustment comes through changes in the internal prices  especially the asset markets. In those economies with floating exchange rates  there may be adjustment in both the internal and external prices. This is exactly what is happening right now. Using the US dollar still as the benchmark currency  it is very interesting to see that since the beginning of the year  the Hang Seng Index has declined by 26% as of last Friday  Singapore Strait Times Index by 32%  the Nikkei 225 by 28% and the other ASEAN indices by between 50-60%. Thus  markets adjust irrespective of the exchange rate regime and the unit of account. 28. Is there any easy way of avoiding the pain of adjustment in Asia due to rising global competition? The answer is clearly no. As a general rule  the faster we adjust  the less the pain. BIS Review 109/1997 - 6 - There have been different approaches to this issue. There are some who think that a floating exchange rate regime would cushion the pain  but many forget that Hong Kong has tried the floating exchange rate regime before  in 1974-83. During that period  growth was more volatile and inflation much higher than what we are experiencing now. As an open economy with trade accounting for 285% of GDP  any inflation would be immediately imported under exchange rate volatility. The recent experience in Asia actually shows that contrary to the theory  floating exchange rates requires even higher interest rates  because of the higher risks associated with exchange rate volatility. 29. Here I would like to correct the common image that the Hong Kong’s exchange rate regime is a peg. The Hong Kong dollar is a fixed exchange rate  not a peg which can be adjusted from time to time. The linked exchange rate system in Hong Kong operates as a currency board system whereby the issue of Hong Kong dollar notes is fully backed by the US dollar at the fixed rate of US$1 to HK$7.80. Such a note-issuing mechanism ensures that currency issued is fully backed by foreign exchange. With the sustained budget surplus and accumulated surplus on the Exchange Fund and Land Fund assets  the actual amount of foreign reserves in Hong Kong amounted to US$88.1 billion at the end of September  the third largest in the world. This is more than seven times Hong Kong dollar cash in circulation or over three times HK$ M1. 30. The currency board system has an automatic adjustment mechanism to maintain exchange rate stability. When there are outflows of funds from the Hong Kong dollar  the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will sell US dollars to banks for Hong Kong dollar. On settlement day  the HKMA will debit the clearing accounts of the banks for the necessary amounts of Hong Kong dollars in return for the US dollar that will be credited to the New York accounts of the same banks. Since banks may have sold more Hong Kong dollars than they have in their clearing accounts with the HKMA  they can only obtain Hong Kong dollars by borrowing from other banks  by bidding up the interbank rates  or selling back the US dollars to the HKMA  that is  by reversing their short position. In fact  the banks do not hold excess Hong Kong dollars because they are generally long in foreign currency. The latest data at the end of July shows that the Hong Kong banking system is short roughly HK$33 billion or US$4 billion. 31. In addition to the robust currency board mechanism  the linked exchange rate system is underpinned by some of the strongest fundamentals in Asia  if not the world: • Growth is strong  at 5.5%. • Fiscal position has been consistently strong  with an average fiscal surplus averaging 2% of GDP for the past decade. Fiscal surplus in 1997 so far is 4.4% of GDP and is expected to exceed 5% of GDP. • The government has no external debt. • Exchange Fund and Land Fund together have more than US$100 billion in assets. • Corporate debt ratios are amongst the lowest in Asia. • The external account is broadly in balance. 32. The free markets and strong fundamentals mean that the nature of the shock is absorbable. Hong Kong does have a strong competitive edge  since we are a service economy with 83% in the services sector. As a major investor and integrator of production in the region  with manufacturing concerns in China and Southeast Asia  Hong Kong companies could adjust production to areas which have the greatest export competitiveness. In addition  the mainland Chinese economy is still growing at 8-9% per annum  with low inflation  a balanced external account and strong BIS Review 109/1997 commitment to reforms in the enterprise and financial sectors. All these auger well for Hong Kong as the main gateway to the Chinese market. 33. The current higher interest rates reflect somewhat a slightly higher risk premium in Asia due to the currency turmoil. We do admit that the higher interest rates affected the stock market and property market. But we should also remember that high interest rates are necessary to cool the overheating in the asset markets that prevailed until recently. Given the excess demand situation in Hong Kong as the economy grew by 6.4% in the second quarter  a correction was expected. A moderation in property prices will help bring houses to more affordable levels to homebuyers. 34. Higher interest rates will also bring down inflation  by encouraging savings. Once inflation and the asset markets correct under the free market regime  Hong Kong will become much more competitive. In real effective exchange rate terms  the competitive effect of neighbouring depreciation will be offset somewhat by a rise in domestic inflation. Higher interest rates will also bring the external account more in line with the fundamentals and improve the trade balance. Hong Kong  as a free market economy  is adjusting exactly according to the textbook. 35. Moreover  our banking sector is very robust and strongly capitalized to withstand any shocks. Operating profits of the local banks grew by about 18% in the first half of 1997 and the bad debt charged fell in the first half of 1997 as the level of classified loans was 2.08%  down from 2.91% a year earlier. The capital adequacy ratios of local banks as a whole exceeds 17%. The average loan-to-value ratio is 70%  with the actual measured loan-to-value ratio being 53.3%  according to our survey at end September 1994. Therefore  HKMA’s efforts to build a strong banking sector  including the distribution of maturity risks through the mortgage corporation and the creation of an efficient RTGS payment system are all necessary efforts to prevent an external shock from affecting the banking system. In particular  the RTGS system allows the HKMA to monitor closely banks’ settlement transactions on a real time basis. Banks would also have to fund their settlements and provide ample liquidity on a more prudent basis. All these are in line with our objective of making the markets more efficient to enable the free market to clear aggregate supply and demand at an equilibrium price quickly. 36. But we should always remember that there is no free lunch. The fixed exchange rate regime implies a flexible economy to adjust to the exchange rate. Hong Kong has high flexibility  attributable to a high savings rate  entrepreneurial spirit and high labour productivity. A fixed exchange rate is a discipline on both the private and public sectors: the economy adjusts to the exchange rate  not the other way around. We do not pretend to say that a fixed exchange rate is the perfect system  because even the IMF admits that there is no perfect system. But it is the best system for Hong Kong. The linked exchange rate system is here to stay. Conclusion 37. As one of the contributors to the World Bank study on the Asian Miracle  I have never considered the Asian growth story as a miracle. Paul Krugman called it perspiration  not inspiration. Yes  it was the result of hard work  high savings  stable governments and good aspirations. But no one can deny that Asian corporations rank amongst some of the most productive and efficient in the world. Perhaps we were victims of our own success. Global capital inflows were the most sincere form of flattery  and those of us who succumbed to the easy money have now wakened to new challenges and risks. 38. Asia is now in a new growth league  with greater global competition. The adjustments will not be easy  especially building stronger and more robust financial systems to handle the new risks of globalization. There is a new realism in Asia  that however painful the adjustment  BIS Review 109/1997 - 8 - we have to make the necessary changes. As competition intensifies at all levels  there can be no reversal to the globalization  and we simply have to recognize that we live in one globe and we share the same growing pains. I am confident that Asia’s basic strength of flexibility  realism and pragmatic policies will see the region through  with a little bit of help from the IMF. In the words of Mr. Michel Camdessus  IMF Managing Director  what has happened is a blessing in disguise. Asia will emerge stronger and more resilient  and it will continue to be a pillar of growth in the new global economy. BIS Review 109/1997"

McDonough  before the Association of German Mortgage Banks in Frankfurt  on 17/11/97.,Mr. McDonough gives a US perspective on Economic and Monetary Union in Europe Remarks by the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  Mr. William J. McDonough  before the Association of German Mortgage Banks in Frankfurt  on 17/11/97. I am honored to be invited by the German Mortgage Banks to be the keynote speaker tonight at the Association’s annual Pfandbrief Forum. It is a great pleasure to be here in Frankfurt among so many distinguished representatives of the German banking and financial community and members of the Bundesbank Council. In my remarks to you this evening  I would like to offer a few thoughts on the implications of Economic and Monetary Union in Europe from my perspective as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Many in the United States today are following developments in Europe’s move toward monetary union with considerable interest. I am certainly among them. There can be no doubt about the magnitude and economic importance of the historic event that will take place on January 1  1999  when the currencies of up to 15 member countries of the European Union are scheduled to be unified. It is a goal toward which Europe has been working ever since the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 creating the European Economic Community. While some might claim that this historic development will have little impact on the U.S. economy  nothing could be further from the truth. The United States will be directly affected in several important ways by the start of Economic and Monetary Union in Europe  or EMU. I would like to review some of the main channels through which EMU is likely to affect American business and policymaking over the next several years. Further  I think it may be useful to highlight some of the important similarities and differences between the currency union that exists in the United States today and the currency union that you are in the process of creating in Europe. The most obvious implication of the start of EMU for the United States -- as well as for the world community -- is the coming into existence of a new currency  the euro  which is intended to function as a major international currency alongside the U.S. dollar. I should make clear at the outset that it would be a mistake to think that the United States looks at this prospect with concern  as if the introduction of the euro could somehow compromise the ability of the United States to continue to conduct trade and financial transactions with the rest of the world. As you well know  the dollar is currently used in roughly 50 percent of world trade transactions and in at least one side of 80 percent of world financial transactions. The introduction of another major international currency will neither harm the depth and liquidity of the dollar market nor hinder the ability of the United States to conduct its external transactions smoothly. On the contrary  to the extent that the birth of the euro fosters deeper trade and financial markets globally and a more efficient international monetary system  all countries stand to benefit  particularly an active participant such as the United States. Let me be more specific. In my view  for the United States and the international monetary system  the implication of a growing international role for the euro over the foreseeable future will be most significant with respect to financial rather than trade transactions. It is quite true that the euro may quickly become the currency of choice in the invoicing of trade between companies in the European Union and their foreign counterparts. Companies in regions with strong links to the European Union  such as those in eastern and central Europe  North Africa  and the CFA French franc zone  may also choose to invoice trade in euros. BIS Review 109/1997 - 2 - More generally  the euro may well expand its importance in world trade beyond the relative trade weight of the European Union countries  following a path similar to that taken by the U.S. dollar and -- before that -- by the pound sterling. Nevertheless  I would argue that the economic effects of these potential changes in invoicing practices are likely to be limited. Why do I say this? First  to a large extent  the re-denomination of a significant share of world trade into euros will mainly represent a shift in invoicing practices from the use of former European currencies to euros. Moreover  third-country effects are unlikely to be major  because the European currencies as a whole are already somewhat over-represented in their share of world trade transactions relative to their countries’ weights in world trade -- not as much so as the dollar  but certainly more so than the yen. Finally  changes in trade invoicing practices have a direct economic impact only on the two parties involved in the transaction  and these effects are limited to determining who ultimately bears the exchange rate risk. In fact  because of the wide variety of risk-hedging instruments that are available to traders exposed to exchange rate fluctuations  the impact of exchange rate risk on trade patterns is likely to be secondary. This conjecture is confirmed by a substantial amount of empirical research. In short  the economic impact of the euro in international trade transactions is likely to be limited. The same cannot be said of the euro’s potential role in international financial transactions. Partly because of their sheer magnitude -- some estimates place the volume of international capital transactions at more than 40 times the volume of international trade transactions -- growth in the use of the euro as the currency of choice in global capital markets will have much more significant repercussions for the United States than will increasing use of the euro in global product markets. To a large extent  these repercussions reflect the well-known gains that stem from increasing returns in the use of a currency as a store of value. As the market for a currency becomes more liquid  the costs of carrying wealth denominated in that currency fall  raising investors’ preferences for denominating their portfolios in that currency. These increased preferences in turn lead to a further deepening and broadening of the market for that currency  costs of holdings are reduced further  and the process continues. As in trade transactions  the dollar is the predominant means of exchange in international financial transactions. Its predominance is especially apparent with respect to large issues of international bonds -- a clear reflection of the low cost of covering exchange rate and interest rate risk for long-term dollar instruments. I would suggest  however  that the current role of the dollar should not be taken for granted. Once the euro comes into existence  the simple conversion of the EMU countries’ outstanding securities into euros will contribute to the immediate creation of a major securities market. This development alone will create a critical mass for a market in euro-denominated securities. It will give the market depth and liquidity  and  in so doing  bring down the costs of conducting transactions  issuing loans  and trading securities below those currently seen for European national currencies -- possibly to levels comparable to those for dollars. The development of such a virtuous cycle could well feed upon itself and lead to the continuous growth of the market for euros. In this context  I would like to suggest that the experience the United States has had with a large  unified capital market may point to ways in which a unified European capital market BIS Review 109/1997 may evolve after the advent of EMU. If the U.S. experience is of any relevance  we may expect to see a decreasing use of bank loans in favor of a growing use of securities in Europe after 1999. Repo markets would also likely grow  potentially along the lines we have seen in the United States  where institutional investors such as mutual funds and pension funds  state and local governments  and insurance companies have become the largest providers of capital under repo arrangements -- in contrast with Europe’s experience  where these types of investors tend to hold bank deposits. A growing role for repurchase arrangements is already apparent in Europe  and this growth may be expected to accelerate once the European central bank starts to operate in this market  accepting -- and fostering -- the use of a wide range of government paper as collateral. It is useful to keep in mind that the move to a single-currency  highly securitized European capital market cannot be expected to be completely painless. Clearly  since banks are the main intermediaries of cross-border transactions  the banking sector will bear the brunt of the costs associated with the changeover to a common currency. For example  it will suffer losses from reduced foreign exchange trading and transfer revenues. It will also have to pay for the retooling of information management and delivery systems  as well as face increased uncertainties in its core deposits. At the same time  however  the larger single market will create new opportunities for banks  particularly in the areas of investment banking and the cross-border sale of deposits  mutual funds  and other savings products. On balance  it seems fair to conclude that the commercial position and earnings of many European banks are likely to come under pressure. This may accelerate the ongoing restructuring of Europe’s banking industry  a process that has been confined  to date  primarily to developments within each country. More broadly  there can be no doubt that the implications of the growth of a more efficient and cost-effective market for euro-denominated capital would extend well beyond Europe. The availability of a new  low-cost channel for portfolio investment  for example  could help reverse the traditional reluctance of households and many institutional investors worldwide to invest internationally -- a reluctance that has long puzzled academics and policymakers. Moreover  a well-developed market for euro-denominated capital would encourage institutional investors from the United States and elsewhere to acquire diversified European portfolios offered in a single currency. In fact  this development could be accelerated if member governments chose to deepen the euro market by increasing the available range of bond maturities  which in some countries is somewhat limited at the short and long ends. In addition  capital might also flow the euro-denominated capital market as an efficient source of funds  in the same way as European businesses and governments have chosen to borrow dollars in recent decades. the opposite direction  as non-European firms and governments tap in While the potential benefits of a more integrated European capital market in the long run are apparent  a number of observers have suggested that the economics of EMU -- as well as its plain mechanics -- may have unwelcome consequences for the dollar and world trade. More specifically  some have argued  EMU may cause a short-run glut of dollars in the international capital markets  leading the dollar to depreciate and the euro to appreciate  with resulting undesirable effects on trade flows. The reason there could be a dollar glut  these observers maintain  is that EMU would eliminate the need for intra-European intervention  reduce the importance of exchange rate management  and allow national central banks to pool reserves for external intervention  thus generally reducing the European central banks’ need for dollar reserves. Moreover  if the euro were BIS Review 109/1997 - 4 - to become an attractive reserve currency for non-European central banks  the dollar glut could become even more severe. While some decline in the reserve role of the dollar is certainly plausible over time with the creation of EMU  I believe that the risk of a dramatic shift in official dollar reserve holdings both in and outside Europe in the wake of EMU has been exaggerated in terms of both its potential scope and effects. I would suggest that it will take some time before the objectives and operating procedures of the European central bank become clearly understood by market participants. Although low inflation will be the ultimate objective of the new European central bank  markets will have to understand precisely how that objective will be pursued: What price aggregate will be the focus of monetary policy? How will intermediate instruments such as monetary aggregates be used to achieve the ultimate objective? What channels will the central bank choose to signal and implement changes in its policy stance? As these longer-term questions are addressed  the policy importance of the external value of the euro  particularly the euro/dollar exchange rate  will certainly be watched carefully. Both market participants and foreign central banks are likely to focus on the euro exchange rate as a high-frequency and widely available -- if somewhat noisy -- indicator of the current and likely future stance of European monetary policy. Given its need to instil confidence in the markets and to ensure the stability of the euro exchange rate  the European central bank is likely to want to be perceived as ready and able to operate effectively in the dollar market  for which substantial dollar reserves may be required. In the short term  the response of non-European central banks to the introduction of the euro is also likely to be cautious. Ultimately  the desired euro holdings of these central banks will largely depend on the decisions they make about their exchange rate regime. A number of countries -- including the central European countries that have applied for membership in the European Union and other countries in Africa -- may decide to peg their currency to the euro. Yet these countries may well wait for the newly-formed European central bank to establish its policy record and clarify its operating procedures before they commit their currencies to a euro peg. Indeed  history suggests that a currency’s role as an international reserve  means of exchange  and store of value is slowly gained and slowly lost -- as the examples of the dollar and pound sterling illustrate. The dollar  in particular  may have seemed on the way to losing much of its international prominence after the demise of the Bretton Woods system in 1973. After declining as a share of international reserves and a means for international transactions from 1974 to the mid-1980s  however  the dollar’s relative use has not changed significantly during the past decade. Indeed  as the U.S. economy has grown more efficient and internationally competitive in the past ten years  the dollar has retained its strong role in the international monetary system. In short  it seems safe to assume that significant changes in the international role of the dollar and the functioning of the international monetary system would occur only gradually  and surely in a manner that could be easily coped with  given the turnover in capital markets we observe today. But should a different international monetary system ultimately emerge in which other currencies  such as the euro  play an increasingly important role alongside the dollar  there would be benefits for the United States as well. Such a development would  for example  impose greater market-led discipline on the United States and  in the process  help us address our chronic low-savings problem. There is another indirect -- although potentially more important -- way in which EMU may affect U.S. business and policymaking. This implication of EMU has to do with the contribution BIS Review 109/1997 a currency union is likely to make to increasing the efficiency and flexibility of the economies that join it. At least since the publication of the “One Market  One Money” study by the European Commission in 1990  observers and analysts of EMU have paid significant attention to the decline in transaction costs that can be achieved by unifying up to 15 different currencies  and to the resulting gains in efficiency for Europe’s economies. The experience of the United States is useful in this respect. The fact that 50 states in the United States share a common currency -- and have done so for over 130 years -- provides the critical foundation for an integrated and efficient capital market that extends from Maine to California and on to Alaska and Hawaii. In this market  capital flows smoothly from high-saving to high-investment areas  as required by changing business conditions  without any thought of exchange rate risk. A common U.S. currency  it is important to note  has many advantages beyond simply reducing transaction costs. It also simplifies choices for households and corporate management  enhances the efficiency with which financial institutions and the payments system function  and promotes competition across the whole productive spectrum. While a common currency in Europe can be expected to lead to similar efficiency gains  the economies of the United States and Europe differ in several important dimensions  so that a common currency is likely to work in substantially different ways in the two regions. The ways in which Europe and the United States differ most have to do with the degree of integration of their labor markets and their fiscal systems. The United States enjoys a very mobile labor force -- across sectors and states -- which allows job losses arising during sector-specific or state-specific recessions to be rapidly absorbed where jobs are growing faster. This contributes to aggregate unemployment being kept reasonably in check. This willingness of American workers to move themselves and their family is a cultural characteristic of our people  no doubt based in the history of the United States as a nation of immigrants. To complement its high degree of labor mobility  the United States also has in place a federal fiscal system that allows the federal government to channel large transfers from fast-growing regions to slow-growing regions. Progressive income taxation  a high elasticity of corporate tax profits to changes in income  and an integrated federal budget are the main components of this system. In contrast to the United States  Europe is characterized by a more segmented labor market and very limited integration of its national fiscal systems. Both these characteristics limit the ability not only of Europe’s private sector to shift resources in response to regional recessions  but also of Europe’s public sector to compensate for this rigidity. This lack of flexibility is widely acknowledged to be one of the root causes of the high unemployment rates that Europe has experienced during the last decade. But  we may well ask  does it necessarily follow that because of the greater rigidity of its labor markets and the lack of a federal fiscal system  Europe cannot accommodate a common currency and instead needs to rely on periodic exchange rate adjustments as surrogates for productive flexibility? I do not think so. While less flexible labor markets and the absence of a federal fiscal system will certainly pose constant challenges for the management of a common European currency  a fluctuating exchange rate need not be the optimal way to respond to these shortcomings. The argument that Europe -- even a core component of Europe -- can ill afford to renounce exchange rate flexibility rests crucially on the view that Europe is significantly more BIS Review 109/1997 - 6 - heterogeneous than the United States and  therefore  more vulnerable to country-specific shocks that can best be corrected by exchange rate changes. I do not support this view. Rather  I believe that in many respects differences among the European economies have been over-emphasized in the public debate. It is possible to suggest  for example  that the economies of some European countries have more in common today than do those of some individual states in the United States  such as New York and Michigan or California and Idaho. Moreover  as a result of the convergence of economic policy objectives  the economic cycles among many European countries have become more synchronized over the last ten years  a trend that is likely to be reinforced by monetary unification. Furthermore  when shocks are mainly at the industry level -- for instance  when a recession hits the automobile or steel industry in Germany and France -- the German and French economies would hardly benefit from an exchange rate change. Such a change  in this case  simply would not affect the appropriate relative prices. By contrast  American policymakers might have found it helpful to devalue the dollar in Texas when oil prices collapsed in the mid-1980s or the dollar in New England at the end of the defense-led growth of the late 1980s. These options  however  simply were not available. In retrospect  it was the discipline fostered by the absence of the opportunity to alter regional exchange rates that forced our firms  local governments  and workers to reorganize  become more efficient  and grow in what are now some of the most productive areas of the United States. Similarly  if national labor markets in Europe become more flexible and efficient in the presence of a common currency and firms learn to count only on their own resources -- with no help from an occasional exchange rate adjustment -- European capital and labor markets may themselves become more integrated. And if greater integration of labor markets can only proceed slowly -- given persistent and unavoidable cultural and language differences -- this need not be the case for financial markets  where the disappearance of exchange rate risk will cause capital to move in response to interest rate differentials of only a very few percentage points. In this context  I would like to make clear that I do not view as ideal the U.S. model where the burden of recessions tends to fall heavily on the shoulders of workers  who may be obliged to move across regions and industries in response to the business cycle. How to deal with the reality of the business cycle is an area where Europe -- with its tradition of social safety nets -- and the United States -- with its tradition of flexible work arrangements -- can perhaps learn something from each other. To date  neither of us seems yet to have found the optimal way to cope with the unavoidable reality of the business cycle to enable us to avoid both high unemployment rates and too skewed a distribution of income. My last general observation about the implications of EMU for the United States has to do with the dramatic changes in macroeconomic policies that will accompany the creation of monetary union in Europe. Naturally  the main change will concern monetary policy  and it is in this area that the similarities between Europe and the United States will ultimately be the greatest. The first similarity is that  with EMU  the formulation of monetary policy in both Europe and the United States will be highly centralized and the European central bank will enjoy  as the Federal Reserve does  a considerable degree of independence. These institutional features will reduce the scope for national governments to bend monetary policy to the needs of their country’s business cycle and will help keep the focus of the European central bank on the objective of price stability. The second similarity we may expect to see between Europe and the United States is that  with EMU  external considerations -- such as the trade balance or the value of the exchange BIS Review 109/1997 rate -- will over time impinge less and less on the conduct of monetary policy  as now is the case in the United States. Once monetary union is in place for all 15 countries  the openness of Europe’s unified economy -- as measured  for example  by the share of exports in relation to GDP -- is likely to be quite similar to that of the U.S. economy  on the order of 10 percent. While the conduct of monetary policy in Europe may increasingly resemble that in the United States  the conduct of fiscal policy will continue to differ significantly in the two regions  largely reflecting the different paths Europe and the United States have taken to monetary unification. In the United States  political union came well ahead of a common monetary policy. The Federal Reserve was not created until 1913  when political unification had been long in place. The situation is  of course  quite different in Europe  where EMU member countries plan to retain substantial political and fiscal independence. Despite this independence  EMU may well foster fiscal coordination among the member countries. This may happen in part because the EMU countries have chosen to subscribe to a set of common guidelines on the magnitude of their fiscal deficits  and in part because these countries will compete for a common pool of savings in an integrated capital market. The prospect of market-based discipline on the fiscal policies pursued by the EMU countries is not so different from the situation faced by individual states and municipalities in the United States. The need for these entities to tap a common capital market to finance their deficits places their actions under a stricter market test than they would face if they could rely mainly on captive local savings. The municipal bond market in the United States is today a very active and competitive market  where yield differences on public debt reflect investors’ perceptions of default risk  and inefficient state and local administrations are quickly penalized for fiscal profligacy. Similar markets are likely to evolve in Europe after 1999. In fact  the major rating agencies are already planning for European issues of government debt following the creation of EMU. By all accounts  the agencies expect these ratings to mirror those currently assigned to countries’ foreign currency debt  with fiscal factors driving rating changes once EMU is well under way. As I hope I have made clear in my remarks this evening  we in the United States  as elsewhere  have been observing the progress toward monetary unification in Europe with great interest. In the process  I think we have learned to appreciate the complexity of this enormous undertaking. One conclusion I have drawn from my observations over the years is that many of the reforms Europe is pursuing on its path to monetary unification -- including fiscal stabilization  tax harmonization  welfare and labor market reform  trade liberalization  and capital market integration -- are goals that are worth pursuing in their own right and for which EMU provides a consistent frame of reference. Continued progress toward furthering these broad-based goals is in the interest not only of Europe but also of the United States. There can be no question that the United States has benefited greatly in the past two decades from Europe’s deepening integration. Europe has provided a steady opening of markets for American products and served as a source of an increasingly efficient supply of goods to U.S. households and firms. Europe’s growing participation in international capital markets  which a successful EMU and a strong euro are intended to further  has also encouraged an increasing flow of savings between Europe and the United States in response to changing macroeconomic conditions in our two regions. We in the United States have much at stake in Europe’s and EMU’s future and we stand ready to work with you and support you in the furtherance of your historic efforts. BIS Review 109/1997
r971208a,1997-12-08,https://www.bis.org/review/r971208a.pdf,Mr. Plenderleith considers what is new in the financial markets in the United Kingdom (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  18 Nov 97),Speech by Mr. Ian Plenderleith  an Executive Director of the Bank of England  at the 6th Central Banking Conference  in London on 18/11/97.,Mr. Plenderleith considers what is new in the financial markets in the United Kingdom Speech by Mr. Ian Plenderleith  an Executive Director of the Bank of England  at the 6th Central Banking Conference  in London on 18/11/97. 1. This has been a year marked by important developments in the UK financial markets and I am delighted to have this opportunity to take you through some of the highlights. The UK’s new monetary framework 2. Perhaps the single most momentous change in the financial landscape in the UK has been the new government’s decision  in May  to give operational responsibility for interest rates to the Bank of England -- essentially  to establish operational independence for the central bank. This significant reform  which took effect immediately  and is to be the subject of legislation recently introduced in the UK Parliament  represented an immediate concrete demonstration of the new government’s commitment to monetary stability. It ensures that monetary policy will continue to be directed to the pursuit of low inflation  recognising that that is an essential pre-condition for achieving the sustained growth in output and employment that we all seek to achieve. The step was warmly welcomed by the markets  as was evidenced by the immediate fall of around 50 basis points it precipitated in long bond yields. 3. The framework put in place with that announcement has been carefully constructed and I would like to point to four features of it that I believe will be important to its long-run effectiveness. 4. First  the target the Bank of England is to pursue -- a low inflation target of 2½% -- is set by the government. In an open market economy  the conduct of an effective monetary policy is helped enormously if the authorities can be clear and open about the price stability objective they are pursuing; and in a democratic system  it is absolutely right that the elected government should set this critical strategic objective for the central bank to pursue. 5. Secondly  it is then the responsibility of the Bank of England to achieve this low inflation target  principally through management of interest rates. But this responsibility is to be conducted within a structured framework. Decisions on interest rates are taken by a Monetary Policy Committee in the Bank  consisting of nine members: five of these come from within the Bank -- the Governor  the two Deputy Governors and the two Executive Directors responsible for monetary policy; the other four are appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and are recognised experts in their field -- in fact  four economists of outstanding reputation. A representative of the Treasury attends the meetings and can contribute to the discussion  but has no vote. The Monetary Policy Committee meets monthly. It announces its decision each month as soon as its meeting concludes  and the minutes of its meetings are published within six weeks  including details of how each member voted. 6. A third important feature is that monetary policy is conducted with a high degree of transparency. I have indicated that the Monetary Policy Committee’s decisions on interest rates are announced immediately; and that the minutes of its meetings are published. In addition  the Bank of England publishes a quarterly Inflation Report  which gives a full account of its monetary actions  and their effect  over the past quarter  and a detailed assessment of the forward outlook for inflation  including a projection looking two years or so ahead and an assessment of the relevant upside or downside risks. This degree of transparency is  we believe  important in generating greater public understanding of the stance of monetary policy  as well as better-informed public debate and greater public confidence in the process. BIS Review 110/1997 - 2 - 7. Closely related is a fourth key feature of the arrangements -- a high degree of accountability by the central bank for its actions. We are accountable in the first instance to our own Court of non-executive Directors  who are specially charged with monitoring the process by which the Monetary Policy Committee discharges its responsibilities. We are accountable also to the government  for which purpose we are required to write an open letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer if inflation deviates by more than 1% either side of the 2½% target  explaining the divergence and the action taken to bring it back on course -- an open letter  and hence a further element of transparency. We are accountable also to Parliament  which will entail members of the Monetary Policy Committee giving evidence to the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee  most probably on the basis of our quarterly Inflation Report  as well as the Bank’s Annual Report being debated in the full House. And we are accountable to the public through the framework of transparency. 8. Put together  these elements provide for greater transparency and accountability of the monetary policy process than in any other country in the world. None of this  of course  guarantees success. But I believe that this new  and carefully-constructed  framework provides the best prospect we have had for years of delivering price stability as a steady foundation for the sustained growth of output and employment that the UK is capable of achieving. This framework for monetary stability  combined with the parallel commitment the government has demonstrated to fiscal responsibility and to promoting a flexible and competitive supply-side structure for the economy  provides a basis for the UK economy to continue to grow on a sustainable basis in the years ahead. Preparations for EMU 9. These changes in the monetary framework have been a major focus of interest of the UK financial markets over the past summer. But in parallel there has also been close focus on the continuing progress being made within the European Union towards Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). 10. The UK government’s statement on EMU last month provided a clear account of UK policy in relation to the monetary union. That statement indicated that  in principle  a successful single currency within a single European market would be of benefit to Europe and to Britain. But  in order for EMU to be right for Britain  the economic benefit should be clear and unambiguous. If  in the end  a single currency is successful  and the economic case is clear and unambiguous  then the government believes Britain should be part of it. The statement identified five economic tests that define whether a clear and unambiguous case can be made for the UK to join EMU. These are: whether there can be sustainable convergence between Britain and the economies of a single currency; whether there is sufficient flexibility to cope with economic change; the effect on investment; the impact on the UK’s financial services industry; and whether it is good for employment. 11. Applying these five economic tests has led the government to the conclusion that British membership of a single currency in 1999 could not meet the tests  so that joining at the start of EMU is not in the country’s economic interests. The government will therefore be notifying our European partners  in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty  that we will not seek membership of the single currency on 1 January 1999; and  barring some fundamental and unforeseen change in economic circumstances  making a decision during this Parliament to join is not seen as realistic. The statement therefore indicates that it is therefore sensible for business and the country to plan on the basis that  in this Parliament  the government does not propose to enter a single currency. However  the government has said that if a single currency works and is successful  Britain should join it. The BIS Review 110/1997 - 3 - government believes that we should therefore begin now to prepare ourselves so that  should the economic tests be met  a decision to join a successful single currency can be made early in the next Parliament. To help with the essential preparations  the Chancellor has invited the Governor of the Bank of England and the heads of the two main bodies representing industry and commerce  and two other Ministers  to join him on a Standing Committee to lead the preparations for EMU. 12. In the UK wholesale financial markets  practical preparations are accordingly proceeding apace. 13. We at the Bank of England have been taking an active role in helping the UK financial markets to prepare for the euro. We do this because  even though the UK will not be in at the start  it is plain that banks and financial institutions in the UK  in their wholesale business for their corporate and institutional customers  in the UK and overseas  will want to be able to offer the full range of financial facilities in the euro from the outset. They will want to be able to offer their customers deposits and foreign exchange facilities in the euro  lending and borrowing in the euro  hedging and collateral in the euro and financing and settlement facilities. The London markets will need to be able to operate in euro from the outset across the full range of their wholesale activities  and practical preparations are now well advanced to achieve that by January 1999. 14. The Bank of England’s part in this extensive process of market-wide preparation  besides equipping ourselves internally for operations in the euro  is a co-ordinating one  in three main ways: first  our job is to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is developed in the UK to allow anyone who wishes to do so to use the euro in wholesale payments and across the financial markets from the first day of EMU. second  we aim to promote discussion between the EMI  national central banks and market participants across Europe about practical issues on which the market is seeking a degree of coordination. and third  we provide information: for example  through a quarterly publication on Practical Issues Arising from the Introduction of the Euro  which is distributed to around 32 000 recipients  including 4 000 directly overseas. The next edition will appear shortly  neatly timed for people’s Christmas reading  and I confidently expect it to be on the best sellers’ list for the festive season. And following the successful symposium we held early this year  we are planning to hold a further symposium  next January at the Bank  on London as the international financial centre for the euro. 15. This exercise -- to prepare the UK markets for wholesale activity in the euro by January 1999 -- has now gathered substantial momentum. Let me touch on a few of the main priorities being pursued: 16. First  market participants agree on the need to be able to trade in London the full range of euro-denominated instruments. 17. Secondly  they also agree on the need for appropriate payments mechanisms in London to carry out transactions in euro both between parties within the UK and cross-border to and from the UK. 18. Thirdly  efficient  cost-effective mechanisms for settling transactions in euro-denominated securities also need to be made available in London. BIS Review 110/1997 - 4 - 19. Fourthly  there is agreement on the desirability of harmonised market conventions for the issuing and trading of euro-denominated instruments. 20. Fifthly  there is agreement on the need for as sound a legal basis as possible for euro transactions  to provide legal certainty and to ensure continuity of contract. 21. Sixthly  there are tax and accounting issues to be addressed  related to the introduction of the euro. 22. There is work going on in each of these areas  and good progress on many of them. Let me give you one example -- the payments system  which lies at the heart of the UK’s preparations for the euro. The UK’s sterling Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system is being developed to accommodate the euro  so that from the beginning of 1999 euro wholesale payments may be made in a safe  efficient and cost-effective way as sterling payments can now  even though the UK will not be a participant in the monetary union at the outset. That development remains on schedule  and it is encouraging that the UK system (CHAPS) has had expressions of interest recently from a number of overseas banks wishing to join. 23. The UK euro system -- CHAPS euro -- will allow payments to be made both between parties within the UK and cross-border from and to the UK through its link to TARGET. Using the knowledge and expertise we have acquired through developing and operating by far the largest RTGS system in Europe -- with average daily volumes of some 70 000 payments  worth some £150 bn -- we are contributing a great deal to the technical development of TARGET. Because it extends the benefits of RTGS systems  in reducing the risk in payments  for the first time cross-border  it is a project we wholeheartedly support. 24. But we also want to see TARGET as efficient and effective as possible  so that it becomes the payment system of first choice for banks  in order to maximise its benefits in reducing systemic risk. We have to recognise that TARGET will be competing with alternative euro payments mechanisms  including correspondent banking and the European Banking Association’s net end-of-day settlement systems. Consistently with this view  we believe that it is essential that payments be able to flow freely throughout the TARGET system. 25. Why do we devote this effort for preparing for the euro? The reason is very straightforward. London’s pre-eminent position as an international financial centre rests on the fact that it provides broad and liquid markets for the full range of internationally-traded currencies and for the vast array of different instruments and facilities denominated in them. The euro will undoubtedly become a major internationally-traded currency  and it is therefore certain that it will be traded extensively in the London markets. The euro thus represents an opportunity  rather than a threat  for the London markets  and it is important that the London markets prepare in good time the systems and infrastructure needed to take advantage of this opportunity. London as a financial centre after EMU 26. The reason why we are convinced that the euro represents a major opportunity for the London markets relates essentially to the strengths that the London markets have displayed over the years: • London is a global financial centre rather than just a European centre  with much of its business generated around the world  not just within Europe. BIS Review 110/1997 - 5 - • London has always thrived on financial innovation  and has a strong track record of capitalising on new opportunities. • The euro may very well bring greater financial activity to the main Continental financial markets. But expansion in these markets is not  on past experience  a zero sum game: it is likely to lead to more  not less  activity in London since London is the major interface with the rest of the world in the European time zone. • The economics of financial market activity point to concentration  to gain economies of scale and facilitate better management control. That is why many firms have been moving their operations  and even headquarters  to London as the preferred financial centre. Uncertainty about UK participation in the single currency has been with us for some time. But undeterred by that uncertainty  firms have continued to concentrate their trading activities in London. • London has an unrivalled range of markets and ancillary services; and an associated deep skill base; and an unbureaucratic approach to financial regulation  which has been developed working with the grain of the market. 27. All these advantages and more help to explain why there are more people working in financial services in the City of London -- over 600 000 -- than there are in the entire population of Frankfurt and its surrounding region! 28. None of this gives any grounds for complacency: the financial services industry is an intensely competitive business. But importantly  if we can harness the strengths of the London markets to the opportunity presented by the euro  I believe that will be an important contribution to the success of the single currency. Of course  London will benefit. But London is not just a UK financial centre. It is a European financial centre  and by providing competitive trading facilities in the euro London can help provide better facilities for business and industry across the whole single market and bring more business into Europe from the rest of the world. Opportunities in euro for market participants 29. I have talked so far principally about the steps the authorities are taking to help prepare the London markets for the euro. But of course  at the end of the day  the authorities can only facilitate: the real challenge in seizing the opportunities presented by the single currency has to be met by market participants themselves. Let me touch on three areas where the advent of the euro is likely to usher in significant changes -- but  I believe  positive changes  offering new business opportunities -- for financial market participants. 30. First  in the bond markets  monetary union will serve to unify the various national government bond markets of the EMU participants  and the already substantial ECU bond market  into a single market in a single currency with multiple national government issuers. Currency risk will be removed  at a stroke. This does not  of course  mean that all government bonds of the different national issuers will trade at the same price: differences will still remain in trading structures and liquidity  in perceptions of sovereign risk and the scale of supply by different governments  and in investors’ basic preferences. But the different national government bonds will tend to trade on essentially the same yield curve  with the focus of the market being concentrated  even more so than at present  on spread relationships. 31. This of course raises the interesting question -- spread over what? Who will provide the benchmark issues? Moreover  the intensified focus on spread may produce two further results. First  there will be even greater incentives than at present for national governments  who will BIS Review 110/1997 - 6 - remain responsible for their own debt management  to converge in their techniques for issuing and marketing their debt. It will be interesting to see whether this will generate greater co-ordination amongst debt management authorities in managing their debt programmes  including  for example  their auction timetables. 32. A second effect in this area flowing from the concentration on spreads may be greater interest in developing a diversified  deeper corporate bond market in euro  as has long been present in the United States  but much less so in other countries. If this happens  it could be a considerable boon to corporate borrowers as a whole because it would extend the range of financing opportunities open to them. 33. A second area where financial market activity in the euro is likely to generate new opportunities is in the short-dated money markets. Foreign exchange traders do clearly face some contraction in their activity  as an inevitable consequence of currency unification. But I do not expect to see too many destitute foreign exchange traders miserably wandering the streets in search of charity or menial employment because of course  as trading amongst the EMU currencies disappears  new international trading is developing in a range of currencies of leading emerging market economies. But more importantly  the advent of the euro will usher in potentially much deeper markets than exist in the individual national centres at present in a range of different money market instruments -- short-dated government and/or central bank paper  commercial bills  CDs  inter-bank deposits  commercial paper  repos  interest-rate futures  swaps  FRAs  options and a miscellany of tailor-made variants on these basic products. Markets in these products are of very varying depth and liquidity  where they exist at all  in the individual local-currency markets of the countries likely to participate in EMU. But all of these instruments are  as it happens  traded in London in the main international currencies; and with the advent of the euro  all of them will also  for the first time  be traded in the major European currency. This represents a tremendous business opportunity for banks and financial institutions with the capacity to trade these instruments and to harness them to the needs of their customers. 34. But there is a third impact on financial markets from the euro that is essentially a necessary prerequisite that must be fulfilled if the benefits from integration of the bond and money markets that I have identified are to be achieved. This is that the new single-currency  euro  markets develop trading practices and standards of conduct  and the necessary infrastructure  that will genuinely facilitate integration. In terms of infrastructure  for example  real-time  same-day wholesale payments are essential to tie together money market activity conducted in different centres in the same instrument in the single currency; and similarly  linkages may also need to be considered between different settlement systems. Common trading practices  and market conventions  will also need to be developed. The lead here lies in many cases with market participants themselves  and with the systems they have developed to serve their trading needs. But it is a process we are very familiar with in London  where we have sought when necessary to encourage just such common initiatives in order to enhance the effectiveness of international trading activity in London. And with an eye on EMU  we have encouraged trading activity in the ECU  particularly in the money markets: hence  for example  the regular programme of monthly auctions for UK government ECU treasury bills  and the quarterly auctions of UK government three-year ECU notes  which have been running for some years. Because of the international flavour of our markets  and because we are conscious that these markets will want to trade the full range of euro instruments in London  we will continue to support initiatives aimed at achieving the necessary market structure where we feel we can make a contribution. Reforms in the London markets BIS Review 110/1997 - 7 - 35. In parallel  we have been pressing ahead with reform in the structure of the UK sterling financial markets  and the pace of progress has notably quickened in 1997. Last year saw two notable events -- the start of the gilt repo market and the completion of the Stock Exchange’s Sequence project  to provide it with a new and modern integrated electronic platform for its trading and information services. This year we have already doubled up on last year  with four major initiatives -- reform of the structure of the Bank of England’s money market operations; the completion of migration to electronic settlement of equities on CREST; the successful launch of SETS  the Stock Exchange electronic order book for equity trading; and a major upgrade of the CGO electronic settlement system for gilts. We have a fifth advance to come next month  with the start of a strips facility for gilts. But for the fact that a central banker is not supposed to reveal that he knows how to play poker  I would call that a “full house”! 36. I believe these are major steps forward to improve trading market facilities  and the essential market infrastructure  in London. And the fact that the London markets have been able to bring so many major projects to a successful conclusion in so short a space of time speaks highly of the resources in depth available in the London markets and the ancillary services. But I would draw attention to one particular feature  which I think is of wider significance. The upgrade of CGO has been effected utilising CREST software -- deliberately  in order to align those two electronic settlement systems -- CGO for gilts  CREST for equities -- more closely. This was a considerable technical achievement  because the operating processes in the two markets are different -- equities settle on T+5  gilts on T+1 (and in some cases T+0); the equity market comprises a large number of relatively moderate-value deals  the gilt market a smaller number of much higher-value deals; hence delay in settlement in gilts is much more disruptive  and needs to be much less frequent  than in equities. Overcoming these differences has been a considerable challenge to the Bank team and I would like to pay tribute to their dedication and expertise and to their achievement in bringing the CGO upgrade to a successful and so far smooth launch just last week. I say this without immodesty because  though I was closely involved in overseeing the project  it was their technical proficiency that delivered the goods. 37. But this achievement has a wider significance. By utilising CREST software in CGO  we have now achieved for the market much of the benefit sought by those who favour a merger of the two systems. In particular  both utilise the same hardware  and the same software application; they operate on the same networks; and users can access both systems via a single terminal using a common gateway. The Bank is  as already announced  planning to seek the views of market participants on what the relative priorities should be in developing payments and settlement systems in London in the year ahead. This will include the possibility of full merger between CGO and CREST  but recognises that merger is only one of a number of IT projects UK financial markets may have to contemplate over the next few years  all of which represent potential claims on scarce IT resources. What is important in the meantime is that a big step towards integration of systems has been achieved  to the benefit of all market users. Conclusion 38. I have tried in these remarks to explain major developments in UK financial markets over the past year. Looking ahead  there is more to do  and I believe EMU will open up new opportunities for the financial markets. I believe this will be particularly so for the international markets in London. We intend to be ready to take full advantage of these opportunities  right from the outset in January 1999  even though the UK will not participate in EMU at that stage. The reason for this is very simple: London is the major European financial market  and we think that extending its activity to include financial services in euro is a significant contribution we in the UK can make from the outset to the success of the monetary union and of the single European market as a whole.

Antonio Fazio  at an international conference celebrating 50 years of Quarterly Review/Moneta e Credito in Rome  on 20/11/97.,Mr. Fazio considers the issue of efficiency and instability in global finance Address given by the Governor of the Bank of Italy  Dott. Antonio Fazio  at an international conference celebrating 50 years of Quarterly Review/Moneta e Credito in Rome  on 20/11/97. In the wake of the Great Depression and the Second World War  the new monetary system set up by the Bretton Woods agreements  together with the liberalisation and expansion of international trade  laid the foundations for a long period of economic growth and stability. From 1950 to 1973 the world economy grew at an annual rate of 4.9%; the industrial countries achieved 4.4%  Latin America  Asia and Oceania a higher rate. Inflation was a little above 3% in the industrial countries and less than 5% in the world as a whole. The economic devastation of the Great Depression had undermined the classical vision of the economy based on the hypothesis of equilibrium  in which the action of policy-makers was constrained by the rigid rules of the gold standard. Following Keynes  in the new monetary order economic policies were assigned a pre-eminent role in governing the cycle. Controls were imposed on capital movements to permit interest rates to be managed in pursuit of domestic objectives. The liberalisation of trade contrasted with a segmentation of the market for savings and financial assets on a national basis. Current account imbalances were to be promptly corrected by means of a fiscal policy serving to re-establish the equality between saving and investment. The system broke down in August 1971  with the suspension of the dollar’s convertibility into gold. The main cause of the crisis lay in the US budget and balance-of-payments deficits  which generated an overhang that was incompatible with the dollar’s role of anchor. Other factors included economic policies in most countries focused primarily on domestic growth and employment  the rise in public expenditure in relation to GDP  the emergence of international financial markets and increasingly large flows of hot money  which reduced the effectiveness of the restrictions on capital movements. In a situation where monetary policies were still concerned with the control of interest rates rather than credit flows and the quantity of money  floating rates ended up by fostering an increase in inflation in the industrial countries and in the rest of the world. Monetary growth in the leading industrial countries continued  at an annual rate of 13%. The oil crisis had an impact that was simultaneously inflationary and recessionary. The growth rate of the industrial countries slowed to around 2.5% in the years from 1973 to 1980  inflation accelerated to 10%. Except in Germany  where monetary policy was directed with greater determination to controlling inflation  the 1970s were marked by high negative real interest rates. The shift in US monetary policy introduced by Paul Volcker in 1979 gave priority to controlling the quantities of credit and money; interest rates rose sharply to well above the inflation rate. The upward movement spread to all the other leading countries. 1. Global finance During the 1980s flexibility of the exchange rates between the main economic regions of the world was accompanied by the dismantling of the barriers to capital movements. Growth in the industrial countries was no more rapid than in the previous decade; it slowed in the 1990s. BIS Review 110/1997 - 2 - The persistence of budget deficits and large external imbalances  the rapid advances in data processing and telecommunications  financial innovation and the activity of institutions that collect and invest savings on a world scale all contributed to the creation of a single  global market for currencies and finance. The harbinger of this development was the growth of the Eurodollar market  which had been boosted in the 1970s by the recycling of the surpluses of the oil-producing countries. The new conditions made it possible for countries to adopt a gradualist approach to correcting budget and  above all  external deficits; it was no longer necessary for saving to equal investment in any given period. The global market was fuelled by the steady accumulation of external debt by the United States and the build-up of a net credit position by Germany and Japan. In all the leading industrial countries except the United Kingdom public debt continued to rise in relation to GDP. Gross financial assets and liabilities continued to grow much more rapidly than economic activity. Between 1982 and 1995 the total liabilities of the six largest industrial countries rose from US$ 25 trillion to US$ 110 trillion and from four to six times their GDP. Over the same period the degree of financial integration increased; today  external liabilities are equal to 60% of GDP. The growth in foreign exchange trading proceeded apace. Favourable investment opportunities encouraged huge flows of capital into the emerging economies; high large balance-of-payments deficits and stable exchange rates. Foreign investment in these markets increased from US$ 50 billion in 1990 to US$ 200 billion in 1995. rates of economic growth were often coupled with In the OECD countries the assets managed by institutional investors rose over the same period from US$ 14 trillion to US$ 23 trillion and from 85 to 102% of the area’s GDP. These intermediaries manage portfolios that tend to be global and take on technically complex risks. They can modify the composition of their assets extremely rapidly even for the sake of making small gains; they exploit the arbitrage opportunities stemming from fiscal segmentation or price differences between different financial centres. 2. Efficiency and stability Savings are now freer to flow towards what investors consider the most profitable investment opportunities. This results in a more efficient allocation of the resources available  support for capital formation and better growth prospects  especially for backward economies. The increase in lending to the developing countries  where the return on capital is higher  is certainly evidence of the markets’ efficiency; on the other hand it brings with it the problem of the sustainability of these countries’ foreign debt and the associated risks for stability  including that of the international financial system. The Mexico crisis and that still open in South-East Asia  like the debt crisis of the early 1980s in Latin America  have shown that a large inflow of funds can temporarily prop up unsustainable economic conditions. Anchoring the national currency to strong currencies when economic policies are inadequate causes the real exchange rate to rise  creating the conditions for a crisis. Insufficient supervision of banks and markets is a contributory factor. BIS Review 110/1997 - 3 - The liquidity of markets  the belief that securities can be sold without incurring substantial losses can lead to an erroneous perception of the risk. Widespread expectations that the international organisations will intervene can accentuate behaviour on the part of intermediaries that is not consistent with the riskiness of investments. It is becoming increasingly important to ensure sound and orderly economic conditions and at the same time to strengthen and enhance the effectiveness of the supervision of intermediaries and markets at the supranational as well as the national level  with the aim of forestalling systemic crises. The restrictive monetary policies adopted in the industrial countries brought annual inflation down from 10% in the 1970s to 5.8% in the 1980s. In the 1990s the objectives have become more ambitious; inflation has fallen further  to an average of 3.1%. Prices have also slowed down considerably in the last three years in the countries of eastern Europe and above all in Latin America. Real interest rates rose substantially in the industrial countries in the 1980s and 1990s. They increased by around 6 percentage points in the early 1980s in response to the change in the focus of US monetary policy. Real long-term rates stood at about 5% in the first half of the 1980s. Today  excluding Japan  they still stand at around 4%  above the rate of economic growth. The high level of real interest rates is a reflection of the high returns that can be earned on investments in the emerging countries and the growing risks of a financial nature  which  even though they originate in national markets  affect the whole system. To an even greater extent  with the money supply constant or even slightly declining in relation to GDP as a consequence of rigorous monetary policies  real interest rates are influenced by the rapid growth in the volume of private and  above all  public sector securities. The ratio of the quantity of money to nominal output has held steady or fallen a little in the leading countries in the 1990s; in 1996 it stood at about 64%. After rising sharply in the 1980s  international liquidity as measured by cross-border deposits has remained virtually unchanged. For the private sector to acquire the growing stock of financial assets  real interest rates have to be high; the growth in public debt  due first and foremost to the imbalances in social security systems  is a source of pressure on real resources. The gap between interest rates and economic growth rates is a cause of rising unemployment. 3. Italy’s role in international finance In the course of the 1990s  with the complete liberalisation of capital movements  Italy has become a full participant in the international financial markets. Gross capital inflows and outflows have increased enormously. This process has sustained the accumulation of financial assets and encouraged residents to diversify their portfolios by type of instrument  country of issue and currency of denomination. Between 1990 and 1996 net portfolio investment abroad by the private sector amounted to 190 trillion lire  accounting for 9% of the growth in total financial assets. The share of foreign instruments in the total financial assets of the private sector rose from 6% at the end of 1989 to 14% at the end of 1996. The growing flow of savings invested abroad also reflects a domestic supply of financial instruments that is still not sufficiently diversified in terms of risks and returns. BIS Review 110/1997 - 4 - Italy’s participation in the global market of finance has encouraged foreign capital inflows  mainly directed towards the government securities market. At the end of last year non-residents held 370 trillion lire of Italian government securities or 20% of the total amount outstanding  compared with 4% at the end of the 1980s. When doubts have emerged about the soundness of economic policy  foreign capital inflows have ceased suddenly and given way to outflows  supplemented by substantial exports of Italian capital. In late 1992 and again in early 1995 non-residents disposed of very large quantities of Italian securities; at the same time residents’ purchases of foreign financial assets increased considerably. These outflows put the lira and securities prices under very heavy pressure. The reaffirmation of monetary policy’s counter-inflationary commitment  the continuation  albeit with pauses  of the efforts to adjust the public finances  and the policy of wage moderation were decisive in easing the pressure and restoring conditions for a stable inflow of capital from abroad. Looking ahead to a situation of recovery in economic activity and a reduction in the external current account surplus  the diversification of residents’ financial portfolios will not put pressure on the exchange rate if non-residents continue to buy large amounts of Italian securities. During the current year  characterised by favourable expectations regarding the Italian economy and the prospects for Economic and Monetary Union  non-residents’ purchases of government securities  totalling more than 80 trillion lire up to September  have contributed to the sharp contraction in the long-term interest rate differential between Italy and the countries with a longer record of price stability and a lower level of public debt. Exports of Italian capital have also increased  however. One of the reasons for the gradualness with which monetary policy has been eased has been to ensure favourable conditions for foreign investment in Italy  taking into account the continual  structural outflow of Italian capital. As Economic and Monetary Union draws closer and national monetary policy’s room for manoeuvre gradually narrows to the point of disappearing  the macroeconomic equilibrium of each country will come to depend increasingly on budgetary  incomes and structural policies. In the absence of changes in the relative values of currencies  imbalances will impinge on competitiveness  production and employment. Public spending in Italy is now equal to more than 50% of GDP. Reducing this ratio will make it possible to ease the burden of taxation and social security contributions. In order to enhance Italy’s competitiveness and reduce the cost of labour  it is also necessary to remove the obstacles hindering competition in the markets for goods and arrive at a more flexible use of labour. 4. Concluding remarks In addition to benefiting the participating countries  the creation of a stable monetary area in Europe will contribute to the stability of the real and financial macroeconomy at the world level. In recent years Europe has been beset by modest growth and insufficient use of available resources; between 1990 and 1996 employment declined by 2 million units. Adverse factors include inefficiencies in some parts of the productive system  market rigidities and excessively large budgets. BIS Review 110/1997 - 5 - The implementation of a closer economic union and the soundness of money and finance over time cannot be entrusted exclusively to monetary policy. They require conditions of greater economic efficiency and the harmonisation of institutional arrangements in the participating countries. A sound currency requires a dynamic economy. Money is largely the product of the credit granted to firms and the State. The stability of its value does not depend only on the quantity in circulation but also on the efficient use of credit. Economic convergence must therefore be pursued not only in the nominal variables but also in labour productivity  a level of taxation that will enhance international competitiveness  and an efficient use of the resources the public sector appropriates. These are the conditions for a monetary union to have the necessary stability and solidity. The global market for currencies and finance influences the performance of all economies. The conditions in that market increasingly appear as exogenous variables of decisive importance. The macroeconomic equilibria of individual economies have to be related to the level and movements of interest rates determined in it and to the exchange rates established there between the leading currencies. The external constraint is increasingly taking the form of the need for each country and economic region to be in overall balance  in terms of financial assets and liabilities  with respect to the rest of the world. The development of the global financial market in the last ten years parallels that of national financial markets in the later nineteenth century and the first half of this century. The increase in financial activity within each national market  the expansion of credit and the development of intermediaries all made a decisive contribution to investment  production and employment. But the need rapidly emerged for overall control of money creation and even earlier for a system of prudential supervision of intermediaries’ activities. Today’s central banks are the result. At the international level the expansion in the nominal amounts of credit and money has no longer been limited by the availability of primary liquidity since the link with gold was broken. The present configuration of the market has evolved spontaneously  largely in conditions of fierce competition. However  given the nature of the variables involved  it is unlikely that a Pareto-efficient equilibrium will be reached. Money produces credit and credit produces more money; it is necessary to govern the growth of these aggregates; an anchor is needed to stabilise their value in terms of goods. In the absence of binding rules and appropriate policies  national economies and the international economy are exposed to the risks of inflation and instability in intermediaries and markets. This inflationary drift is likely to lead to speculative bubbles  excessive increases in the value of real and financial assets. The international crises that occur from time to time diminish the value of financial wealth and curb inflationary pressures at the world level. With many economies suffering from stagnation and poor fundamentals  the low cost and rapid expansion of dollar financing in the early 1990s and the subsequent restriction  together with the more recent monetary expansion in Japan and loss of value of the yen  have probably contributed to the instability of the global market for finance. BIS Review 110/1997 - 6 - The efforts  redoubled in recent years  to achieve monetary stability in most of the industrial countries  the banking supervision started by the Group of Ten for developed countries  its extension to the emerging countries and the surveillance performed by the IMF are playing a role of great systemic importance. Faced with open and competitive markets  the strengthening of cooperation helps to forestall crises  increases the efficacy of corrective action. Effective action by central banks  supervisory authorities and the IMF is a first response to the new problems of monetary and financial stability raised by the globalisation of markets; it may require more certain and firmly based international institutional arrangements.

Michel Camdessus  at a press briefing in Singapore  on 13/11/97.,Mr. Camdessus considers the lessons from Southeast Asia Remarks by the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund  M. Michel Camdessus  at a press briefing in Singapore  on 13/11/97. How could events in Southeast Asia unfold as they did  after so many years of outstanding performance? We have a fairly clear analysis of what happened in Thailand. The more difficult question is how the crisis spread so quickly to other economies in the region. I’m not sure we have the full picture yet  but let me give you my perspective on the causes of the crisis and where we go from here. I. How could it happen? Certainly  the Thai crisis did not strike out of the clear blue sky. On the contrary  there were numerous signs of a gathering storm. Macroeconomic indicators pointed to substantial imbalances: substantial real exchange rate appreciation; a marked slowdown in export growth; a persistently large current account deficit financed increasingly by portfolio inflows  including a substantial amount of short-term capital; and rising external debt. These problems  in turn  exposed other weaknesses in the Thai economy  including substantial  unhedged foreign currency-denominated borrowing by the private sector  an inflated domestic property market  and a weak and over-exposed banking system. Markets issued their own warnings in the form of declining equity prices and mounting exchange rate pressure  as doubts about the sustainability of policies grew. And as you know  the Fund also stressed these problems and pressed for urgent measures in a continuous dialogue with the Thai authorities. It was  of course  difficult for the authorities in Thailand and elsewhere in the region to recognize  after so many years of outstanding macroeconomic performance  that serious underlying deficiencies could seriously jeopardize their track record. This certainly contributed to the delay in taking the necessary corrective action. And at last  in the absence of convincing policy action  the storm broke. We all have been troubled by developments in the Thai economy  both because they have been so costly for Thailand and its neighbors and because they were so preventable. But at least their origins are by and large clear. What is less evident  and therefore more unsettling to all who are trying to make sense of broader regional developments  is how the crisis spread as it did to economies such as Indonesia  Malaysia and the Philippines  where current account deficits were generally smaller and foreign direct investment more substantial. Although it may be some time yet before we have the complete answer to this question  some elements of the explanation are becoming clear. Part of the explanation lies in the extent to which developments in Thailand have affected conditions in neighboring countries. For example  in expectation that the depreciation of the baht would erode the competitiveness of Thailand’s trade competitors  their currencies also weakened. And as these currency slides acquired an almost self-perpetuating character  the debt service costs of the domestic private sector increased. Uncertainty about how far these currencies would slide and how much debt service costs would increase encouraged a rush to hedge external liabilities that only intensified exchange rate and interest rate pressures. BIS Review 111/1997 - 2 - Another factor is that problems in the Thai economy prompted markets to take a closer look at the risks in other countries. And what they saw -- to different degrees in different places -- were many of the same problems affecting Thailand: among them  overvalued real estate markets  weak and over-extended banking sectors  poor prudential supervision  and substantial private short-term borrowing in foreign currency. Moreover  after Thailand  markets began to look more critically at weaknesses they had previously considered minor  or at least manageable in an orderly way  given time. I see two other factors that hastened the stampede: one  the lack of transparency  and hence the increased uncertainty  about government and central bank operations  about the true state of financial sectors  about the links between banks  industry  and government and the impact these links might have on economic policy; and two  the controls -- and threat of controls -- on market activity. Given the tendency of financial markets participants to run with the herd  this was a sure-fire way to send the herd scrambling for safer pastures and set back efforts to restore confidence. II. What lessons should we draw from all of this? The first lesson is the most obvious one: the necessity of taking early action to correct macroeconomic imbalances before they precipitate a crisis. This did not happen in Thailand  despite timely and vigorous warnings. On the contrary  policymakers attacked the symptom of the crisis  the pressure on the baht  accumulating large reserve losses and forward foreign exchange liabilities in the process. This  together with delays in addressing Thailand’s severe financial sector problems and lingering political uncertainties  clearly contributed to a deepening of the crisis and its spread to other economies in the region. The second lesson is that other countries can find that their vulnerability to crises in other markets is greater than economic fundamentals would suggest. Consequently  they need to take pre-emptive actions to strengthen their policies. Where might such action be needed? Several suggestions come to mind: one  maintaining an appropriate exchange rate and exchange rate regime. Clearly  there is no single “right” choice  but more flexible exchange rates can help provide early and visible signals of the need for policy adjustments and are less likely to invite reckless behavior on the part of borrowers and lenders. But regardless of the exchange rate arrangement chosen  appropriate macroeconomic policies are essential to ensure its success; two  maintaining a proper policy mix -- among other reasons -- so that high domestic interest rates do not damage the domestic economy  attract excessive amounts of short-term capital  or preclude further monetary tightening if market conditions require; indeed  it is important to keep the option of using the interest rate instrument open  so that the authorities have some room for manoeuvre in times of international instability; three  strengthening structural policies -- especially the policies and institutions such as better prudential supervision  needed to underpin a sound financial system; and four  carrying out other supporting reforms -- what we call “second generation” reforms -- to promote domestic competition  increase transparency and accountability  improve governance  help ensure that the benefits of future growth are widely shared  and otherwise strengthen the foundations for future growth. BIS Review 111/1997 III. Restoring confidence As developments have shown  confidence  once lost  is hard to regain. Restoring confidence takes a strong commitment to economic adjustment and reform demonstrated by the implementation of often painful measures. It also requires a free flow of timely  accurate  and comprehensive information so that markets can assess the extent of underlying problems and the seriousness of efforts to correct them and uncertainty can be reduced. And  of course  restoring confidence takes time. This process is now under way in Southeast Asia. With the support of the IMF  Japan  and a number of other countries in the region  Thailand has launched a courageous and comprehensive program that addresses the problems of large external deficits and troubled financial institutions. As a result  the budget is moving back into surplus and a comprehensive restructuring of the financial sector is getting under way. The Philippines  for its part  has taken necessary measures and extended its program with the IMF under which a substantial amount of economic adjustment and reform had already taken place. Malaysia is also adapting to changing conditions by scaling back investment plans  tightening its fiscal stance  and strengthening prudential banking regulations. Indonesia has strengthened its policy stance in continuous dialogue with us  and has recently reached agreement with the Fund on a major program consisting of: strong monetary and fiscal policies to bring about orderly adjustment in the economy and restore confidence to financial markets; a major restructuring of the financial sector  along with measures to ensure its future soundness; and significant deregulation measures and trade reforms that should improve economic efficiency immediately and over the longer term. The Fund has agreed to support this program with a loan of $10 billion in a total package of $23 billion  of which $18 billion will consist of multilateral financing. On top of that  a contingency safety net is being established through which an important group of countries have declared their readiness to complement our package in the case of unexpected need. Naturally  it will take time for these efforts to bear fruit. But developments in recent months have by no means wiped out the achievements of past decades. On the contrary  the region’s longer term fundamentals -- including its high domestic saving rates  strong fiscal positions  dynamic private sectors  and recent gains in competitiveness -- remain favorable. Moreover  all of these countries still have a long way to go to catch up with advanced economies. Thus  with sound policies  they should be able to sustain high rates of growth for another two decades or more. In the less distant future  growth can be expected to rebound strongly after a relatively short  but sharp  weakening of economic activity  especially in Thailand  and a rapid narrowing of external deficits. In fact  we are already seeing improvements in exports  even though recent exchange rate changes have not had much opportunity yet to generate their effects. And as these adjustments take place  each of these countries will have seized the opportunity to strengthen their economies in fundamental ways. This leads me to agree with those in the region who see this crisis not as a blight on the future  but as a blessing in disguise. Indeed  after this period of adjustment  these economies will emerge stronger than before. BIS Review 111/1997 - 4 - In the meantime  I hope that some perspective about the benefits of global markets will be maintained. First  we must give credit where credit is due: the capital provided by global markets has been a key factor in Southeast Asia’s exceptional growth rates and its ability to lift so many out of poverty. Certainly  there are risks in tapping global markets to which no country is immune. At times  markets can be slow to react to changes in economic conditions and then react sharply; and in some instances  herd instinct seems to prevail. But let us not forget that markets also provide tremendous opportunities to accelerate growth and development  as Southeast Asia itself so vividly shows. Thus  the lesson to be drawn from recent developments is not about the risks of global markets  but rather about the importance of approaching markets in a responsible manner -- with strong macroeconomic fundamentals and sound structural policies that give markets confidence and therefore encourage long-term investment; with respect for the signals that markets provide; and with transparent and market-friendly policies that allow markets to allocate resources efficiently. IV. Perspectives for stronger regional cooperation Spillover and contagion effects can be so rapid  so costly  to countries with basically sound policies  that every country has an obligation to keep its own house in order. No country should run the risk of becoming the tinder for a wider conflagration. At the same time  there is also much that can be done on a regional and multilateral basis to bolster the efforts of individual countries seeking to manage their economies well. At the regional level  countries can make a valuable contribution to regional and global stability by joining voluntarily with their neighbors in mutual surveillance. The objective should be to complement IMF surveillance by developing a “club spirit” through which neighboring countries can encourage one another -- and  at times  exert some peer pressure on one another -- to pursue sound policies. We welcome the efforts being made in this direction in various fora. To be effective  such regional surveillance will  of course  have to be based on sound economic analysis. In this connection  the management and staff of the IMF are ready to contribute to regional surveillance in Asia  as they already do in Europe  the G-7  and other fora. Indeed  one of the tasks of our new regional office in Tokyo could be to help promote more intensive regional surveillance. V. The response of the Fund At the multilateral level  the international community sees it as indispensable to work and cooperate through a central institution  the IMF  in order to help countries deal with the opportunities and risks of globalization. And given the challenges of the global financial markets  the international community has encouraged the Fund to strengthen its capacity in this respect. The Fund’s response centers on four broad areas. First  we have strengthened Fund surveillance  which  as you know  lies at the heart of the IMF’s efforts to maintain an orderly international monetary system. In order to detect financial tensions as early as possible  we have sought to make our dialogue with member countries more continuous and probing and put more emphasis on the continuous and timely provision of accurate data. We are also concentrating more on policies decided at a regional level  on the regional implications of national economic policies  on banking and financial sector soundness  and on the policies and institutions that sound financial systems require. BIS Review 111/1997 Second  we are doing what we can to help markets function more smoothly. Considerable progress has been made in liberalising current account transactions worldwide so that countries can take advantage of the opportunities offered by the expansion of world trade. Now  we must turn our attention to fostering an orderly liberalization of capital account transactions  so that countries can also reap the benefits of global capital markets  while minimizing their risks. To this end  IMF members have agreed that the Fund’s charter should be amended to make the liberalization of capital movements one of the purposes of the Fund and to extend the Fund’s jurisdiction to capital movements  with appropriate safeguards  including transitional arrangements  to ensure that liberalization is neither premature nor unduly delayed. At the same time  the IMF is actively encouraging all countries to be transparent about their economic performance by improving the dissemination of economic and financial data to the public. Greater transparency will help strengthen market discipline and avoid market surprises that can lead to disruptive market reactions. To this end  the Fund has developed a set of standards regarding the quality  coverage  frequency  and timeliness of data made available to the public and has established a Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on the Internet to which 43 economies have now subscribed  including Hong Kong  Indonesia  Korea  Malaysia  the Philippines  Singapore  and Thailand. Procedures have also been put in place through which countries can make known to the markets  and to the public in general  the Fund’s views on their economic policies and situation. Recognizing the importance for growth of creating an environment that encourages private sector activity  the Fund has also become more active -- in close collaboration with the World Bank  regional development banks  and others -- in promoting the “second generation” reforms that I referred to earlier. These include developing an institutional framework that will  among other things  provide an efficient  professional justice system  help limit arbitrary and corrupt government practices  and set clear regulatory and supervisory standards for markets  including financial markets. They also include policies to improve the quality of public expenditure  making adequate allocations for education and health to help ensure that individuals are able to realize their potential to participate actively in a market economy  and providing social protection to those who bear the brunt of the changes of a dynamic economy. Third  the Fund has taken action on several fronts to strengthen its resource base and adapt its procedures and financing facilities. As you may know  the membership has just agreed to an increase of 45 percent  equivalent to about $90 billion  in IMF quotas. This will raise the capital base of the institution to some $290 billion. In addition  the Fund has taken steps to augment its financial resources through the agreement on the New Arrangements to Borrow. Under these arrangements  participants would be prepared to lend up to the equivalent of some $47 billion when additional resources are needed to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system  or deal with an exceptional situation that poses a threat to the stability of the system. We hope that participants who have not yet done so will complete the necessary legislative action so that these arrangements can enter into force soon. BIS Review 111/1997 - 6 - Furthermore  in order to allow all members to participate on an equitable basis in the SDR system  agreement has been reached on a proposal to amend the Fund’s Articles of Agreement to authorize a special one-time allocation of SDRs of about $30 billion that would equalize all members’ ratios of SDR allocations to quotas and would double the amount of SDRs allocated to date. These resources will supplement members’ reserves  giving them more flexibility in economic policies and a cushion against adverse developments. Last but not least  recent experience has demonstrated once again that early warnings cannot always prevent crisis from blowing up. This makes it indispensable for the international community to strengthen the financial capacity of its central monetary institution to assist countries in a crisis situation. This is also why the Fund has established an emergency financing mechanism to allow financial assistance to be provided more speedily  when countries facing external crises are willing to take strong corrective action. This mechanism was used effectively to expedite the recent programs for the Philippines  Thailand  and Indonesia. Even if it would be naive to believe that such programs could produce an immediate return to the status quo ante  we are confident that once these programs have produced their full effects in the next months  these economies will be in a much better position to start growing again at a strong  but more sustainable  rate. In conclusion  these are trying times in Southeast Asia. But the mechanisms are in place at the national and multilateral levels—and soon  I hope  at the regional level -- to enable your countries not just to pull through this crisis  but to emerge stronger than before. The only other pre-requisite for your success is the resolve to put current problems behind you. I see no reason why we will not see the same determination in Southeast Asia in the future as we have seen in the past. BIS Review 111/1997

Dramatic advances in the global financial system have enabled us to materially improve the efficiency of the flows of capital and payments. Those advances  however  have also enhanced the ability of the system to rapidly transmit problems in one part of the globe to another. The events of recent weeks have underscored this latter process. The lessons we are learning from these experiences hopefully can be applied to better the workings of the international financial system  a system that has done so much to foster gains in living standards worldwide. The current crisis is likely to accelerate the dismantling in many Asian countries of the remnants of a system with large elements of government-directed investment  in which finance played a key role in carrying out the state’s objectives. Such a system inevitably has led to the investment excesses and errors to which all similar endeavors seem prone. Government-directed production  financed with directed bank loans  cannot readily adjust to the continuously changing patterns of market demand for domestically consumed goods or exports. Gluts and shortages are inevitable. The accelerated opening up in recent years of product and financial markets worldwide offers enormous benefits to all nations over the long run. However  it has also exposed more quickly and harshly the underlying rigidities of economic systems in which governments -- or governments working with large industrial groups -- exercise substantial influence over resource allocation. Such systems can produce vigorous growth for a time when the gap between indigenous applied technologies and world standards is large  such as in the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s and Southeast Asia in the 1980s and 1990s. But as the gap narrows  the ability of these systems to handle their increasingly sophisticated economies declines markedly. In western developed economies  in contrast  market forces have been allowed much freer rein to dictate production schedules. Rapid responses by businesses to changes in free-market prices have muted much of the tendency for unsold goods to back up  or unmet needs to produce shortages. Recent improvements in technology have significantly compressed business response times and enhanced the effectiveness of the market mechanism. Most Asian policymakers  while justly proud of the enormous success of their economies in recent decades  nonetheless have been moving of late toward these more open and flexible economies. Belatedly perhaps  they have perceived the problems to which their systems are prone and recognized the unforgiving nature of the new global market forces. Doubtless  the current crises will hasten that trend. While the adjustments may be difficult for a time  these crises will pass. Stronger individual economies and a more robust and efficient international economic and financial system will surely emerge in their wake. While each of the Asian economies is unique in many important respects  the sources of their spectacular growth in recent years  in some cases decades  and the problems that have emerged are relevant to a greater or lesser extent to nearly all of them. Following the early post-World War II period  policies generally fostering low levels of inflation and high rates of savings and investment -- including investment in human capital through education -- contributed to a sustained period of rapid growth. In some cases this BIS Review 111/1997 - 2 - started in the 1960s and 1970s  but by the 1980s most economies in the region were expanding vigorously. Foreign net capital inflows grew  but until recently were relatively modest. The World Bank estimates that net inflows of long-term debt  foreign direct investment  and equity purchases to the Asia-Pacific region were only about $25 billion in 1990  but exploded to more than $110 billion by 1996; less comprehensive data suggest that inflows rose to a still higher rate earlier this year. Sustained  spectacular growth in Asian economies fostered expectations of high returns with moderate risk. Moreover the global stock market boom of the 1990s provided the impetus to seek these perceived high returns. As that boom progressed  investors in many industrial countries found themselves more heavily concentrated in the recently higher valued securities of companies in the developed world  whose rates of return  in many instances  had reached levels perceived as uncompetitive with the earnings potential in emerging economies  especially in Asia. The resultant diversification induced a sharp increase in capital flows into those economies. To a large extent  they came from investors in the United States and western Europe. A substantial amount came from Japan  as well  owing more to a search for higher yields than to rising stock prices and capital gains in that country. The rising yen through mid-1995 also encouraged a substantial increase in direct investment outflows from Japan. In retrospect  it is clear that more investment monies flowed into these economies than could be profitably employed at reasonable risk. It may have been inevitable in those conditions of rapid growth  ample liquidity  and an absence of sufficient profitable alternatives  that much investment moved into the real estate sector  with an emphasis by both the public and private sectors on conspicuous construction projects that had little economic rationale. These real estate assets  in turn  ended up as collateral for a significant proportion of the assets of domestic financial systems. In many instances  those financial systems were already less than robust  beset with problems of poor lending standards  weak supervisory regimes  and inadequate capital. At the same time  rising business leverage added to financial fragility. Businesses were borrowing to maintain high rates of return on equity and weak financial systems were poorly disciplining this process. In addition  explicit government guarantees of debt or  more often  the presumption of such guarantees by the investment community  encouraged insufficient vigilance by lenders and hence greater leverage. But high debt burdens allow little tolerance for rising interest rates or slowdowns in economic growth  as recent events have demonstrated. Moreover  the rapidly growing foreign-currency-denominated debt  in part the result of pegged exchange rates to the dollar  put pressure on companies to earn foreign exchange. But earning it became increasingly difficult. The substantial rise in the value of the dollar since mid-1995  especially relative to the yen  made exports of the Southeast Asian economies less competitive. In addition  in some cases  the glut of semiconductors in 1996 and the accelerated drop in their prices suppressed export earnings growth  exerting further pressures on highly leveraged businesses. In time  the pressures on what had become fixed-exchange-rate regimes mounted as investors  confronted with ever fewer profitable prospects  slowed the pace of new capital inflows. Fearing devaluation  many domestic Asian businesses sought increasingly to convert domestic currencies into foreign currencies  or  equivalently  slowed the conversion of export earnings into domestic currencies. To counter pressures on exchange rates  countries raised interest rates. For fixed-exchange-rate  highly leveraged economies  it was only a matter of time BIS Review 111/1997 before slower growth and higher interest rates led to difficulties for borrowers  especially those with fixed obligations. Particularly troublesome over the past several months has been the so-called contagion effect of weakness in one economy spreading to others as investors perceive  rightly or wrongly  similar vulnerabilities. This is an age-old phenomenon. When investors are unsettled by uncertainties and fears  they withdraw commitments on a broad front; the finer distinctions between countries and currencies are lost. There is a flight to safe-haven investments  many of which are in developed nations. Perhaps  given the circumstances  it was inevitable that the impressive and rapid growth experienced by the economies in the Asian region would encounter a temporary slowdown or pause. I say temporary because there is no reason that above-average growth in countries that are still in a position to gain from catching up with the prevailing technology cannot persist for a very long time  provided their markets are opened to the full force of competition. Nonetheless  free-market  even partially free-market  economies do periodically run into difficulties because investment mistakes invariably occur. And  as I noted earlier  many of these mistakes arose from government-directed or influenced investments. When this happens  private capital flows may temporarily turn adverse. In these circumstances  individual companies should be allowed to default  private investors should take their losses  and government policies should be directed toward laying the macroeconomic and structural foundations for renewed expansion. New growth opportunities must be allowed to emerge. Although troubled Asian countries were usually characterized by a combination of current account deficits  large net foreign currency exposures  and constraints on exchange rate fluctuations  one cannot generalize that these are always signs of impending difficulties. the economies of the Large current account deficits  per se  are not dangerous if they result from direct investment inflows that are not subject to rapid withdrawal and that generate an increase in income sufficient to compensate the investors. Foreign currency exposures need not be a problem if positions are properly managed and the risks are recognized. Fixed exchange rates  also  are not necessarily a problem. Indeed  if they can be sustained  they yield extensive benefits in lower risk and lower costs for all international transactions. But a small open economy can maintain an exchange rate fixed to a hard currency only under certain conditions. Both Austria and the Netherlands  for example  have been able to lock their currencies against the Deutsche Mark because their economies are tightly linked through trade with Germany  they mirror the Bundesbank’s monetary policies  and they are perceived to engage in prudent fiscal policies. Were it not for issues of national identity and seignorage  they could just as readily embrace the DM as their domestic currency without any economic disruption. Other economies  such as Argentina and Hong Kong  have fixed their exchange rates essentially through currency boards. Changes in dollar reserves directly affect the monetary base of those economies. But when exchange rates are fixed  with or without currency boards  should monetary and fiscal policies diverge significantly from those of the larger economy  the currency lock of the smaller economy would be difficult to hold irrespective of the size of reserves. Large reserves can delay adjustment. They cannot prevent it if policies are inconsistent  or prices in the smaller country are inflexible. A well-functioning international financial system will seek out anomalies in policy alignments and exchange rates and set them right. In such a system  the exploitation of BIS Review 111/1997 - 4 - above-normal profit opportunities  that is  arbitrage  will force prices to change until expected returns have been equalized. To policymakers in the country whose currency is not appropriately aligned  capital outflows are too often seen as attacks by marauding currency speculators. There have no doubt been some such attempts on occasion. But speculators rarely succeed in dislodging an exchange rate that is firmly rooted in compatible policies and cost structures. More often  speculation forces currencies through arbitrage into a closer alignment with underlying market values to the benefit of the international economic and financial system as a whole. We used to describe capital flight as “hot money”. But we soon recognized that it was not the money that was “hot”  but the place it was running from. The prodigious expansion of cross-border financial transactions in recent years has tightened and refined the arbitrage process significantly. But  to repeat  the inestimable advantages that it brings to trade and standards of living also carry a price. The inevitable investment mistakes and governmental policy failures are more rapidly transmitted to other markets by this process than was the case say twenty  or even ten  years ago. Moreover  there is little evidence to suggest that the rate of increase of financial transactions will slow materially in the years immediately ahead. Technology will continue to reduce the costs of finding and exploiting perceived differences in risk-adjusted rates of return around the world  helping to direct capital even more to its most efficient use. Already  covered rates of return on actively traded interest-rate instruments have been equalized among many industrial countries. But the broader merging of world savings and investment markets  clearly  has not been achieved  largely because investors are fearful of investing in countries they do not understand to the extent that they do their own  or are uninformed of the opportunities. One measure of this so-called home bias in world investments is the degree that portfolios remain substantially local. Foreign investments  on average  represent less than 10 percent of U.S. portfolios  for example. The percentage of Japanese portfolios is only slightly higher  and 15 percent of German portfolios is in foreign assets. The partial exception is Great Britain  where  with a longer history of global financial involvement  one-third of portfolios is invested in foreign assets. Home bias in investments is considerably less than it was ten years ago  but we are still far from full globalization. Unless government restrictions inhibit the expansion of ever more sophisticated financial products that enable savers in one part of the world to reduce risk by investing in another  the bias will continue to diminish and the size of the international financial system will continue to expand at a significant pace. It is this overall diversification  and hence lowering of risk  that an effective international financial system offers. It facilitates the ever more efficient functioning of the global economic system and  hence  is a major contributor to rising standards of living worldwide. Nonetheless  there are those who ask whether the price of so sophisticated a financial system is too high. Would it not be better to slow it down a bit  and perhaps achieve a system somewhat more forgiving of mistakes  even recognizing that such a slowing may entail some shortfall in long-term economic growth? Even if we could implement such a tradeoff  with only minor disruption  should we try? For centuries groups in our societies have railed against  and endeavored on occasion to BIS Review 111/1997 destroy  new inventions. Fortunately for us the Luddites and their ilk failed  and recent generations have enjoyed the fruits of those technologies. Moreover such a slowdown may not even be possible -- at least without major disruption and cost. Newer technologies  especially advanced telecommunications  make it exceptionally difficult for open markets  with associated opportunities  to be suppressed. Price and capital controls  which might have been feasible a half century ago  would be very difficult to implement in today’s more technologically advanced environment. Tinkering at the edges of our system in order to produce a less frenetic pace of change would be easily circumvented. Arguably  it would take massive government controls to substantially slow the advance toward greater efficiency of our systems. This would surely produce a far more negative impact on economic growth than would be acceptable to even the most ardent advocates of reining in the rapid expansion of our international financial system. If  as I suspect  it turns out after due deliberation and analysis  that slowing the pace of financial modernization is not in fact seen as a feasible alternative  what policy alternatives confront the international financial community to contain the periodic disruptions that are bound to occur in any free market economy? A financial system  like all structures  is as strong as its weakest link. As the international financial system has become even more complex  the particular areas of weakness to be addressed have changed. At the risk of oversimplification  let’s examine some of the key links of our current infrastructure. Today  the organized exchanges and over-the-counter markets of industrial countries can handle massive volumes of transactions. Even in emerging countries exchanges are developing and expanding. In contrast  during the world-wide stock market crash of October 1987  the transactions systems were under severe stress and  indeed  some broke down  incapable of handling the enlarged volumes. At that time  the Hong Kong stock exchange could not open for several days. The New York Stock Exchange was straining badly under the near 400 million daily share volume of late October 1987  with long reporting delays creating uncertainties that  doubtless  exaggerated the price declines. Those weaker links have since been strengthened by large infrastructure investments. Almost 1.2 billion shares traded on the NYSE on October 28 of this year  three times the 1987 volumes with no evident problems or delays. Our equity  debt  and foreign exchange trading systems  and their peripheral futures and options markets have functioned well under stress recently. These systems are not weak links in the developed economies  nor  for the most part are they in other economies. Neither is the payment system  that complex network  which transfers funds and securities in huge and growing volumes domestically and internationally  rapidly and efficiently. The private and public sectors across the globe have endeavored diligently for years to expand the capacity of the system to meet the increasing demands put upon it. And they have initiated and strengthened procedures for reducing risk in settling transactions  and diminishing uncertainties. That they have generally succeeded is evident from the smoothness with which huge volumes of funds produced under recent stressed market conditions were transferred and settled with finality  through various netting and clearing arrangements. Banks are another matter. These are highly leveraged institutions  financed in part by interbank credits and  hence  prone to crises of confidence that can quickly spread. In most developed nations banking systems appear reasonably solid. Japan has been somewhat of an BIS Review 111/1997 - 6 - exception  but there have been some positive signs there  as well. Banks have been recognizing losses  and the government seems finally to be appropriately addressing their problems. In a large number of emerging nations  as I indicated previously  banks are in poor shape. Lax lending has created a high incidence of non-performing loans  supported by inadequate capital  leaving banks vulnerable to declines in collateral values and non-performance by borrowers. How can such deficient institutions be elevated to a level that would allow their economies to function effectively in our increasingly sophisticated international financial system? Certainly  improved cost and risk management and elimination of poor lending practices are a good place to start. But these cannot be accomplished overnight. Loan officers with experience judging credit and market risks are in very short supply in emerging economies. Training will require time. The same difficulties confront bank supervision and regulation. Important efforts in this area have been underway for several years through the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements  the International Monetary Fund  and the World Bank. But again  it will take time to develop adequate systems and trained personnel. Moreover  robust banking and financial systems require firmly enforced laws of contract  and transparent  market-oriented systems of corporate reporting and governance. The current crisis in Asia is  to a much greater extent than many previous crises  one of private  not public  debts  at least de jure. Arguably  the absence of efficient and transparent work-out arrangements for troubled private borrowers makes the problems more difficult to deal with. Efficient bankruptcy arrangements reduce disruptions to economic activity that often arise when losses have to be imposed on creditors. Many developing countries do not have good work-out arrangements for troubled debtors  and  as a result  governments in these countries often feel compelled to bail them out rather than accept the consequences of defaults. The most troublesome aspect of many banking systems of emerging countries  to expand on the issue I raised earlier  is the widespread prevalence of loans driven by “industrial policy” imperatives rather than market forces. What is wrong with policy -- that is  politically-driven -- loans? Potentially nothing if they were made to firms to finance expansions that just happened to coincide with a rise in consumer or business or overseas demand for their newly-produced products. In these circumstances  the loan proceeds would have been profitably employed and the loan repaid at maturity with interest. Unfortunately  this is often not the case. Policy loans  in too many instances  foster misuse of resources  unprofitable expansions  losses  and eventually loan defaults. In many cases  of course  these loans regrettably end up being guaranteed by governments. If denominated in local currency  they can be financed with the printing press -- though with consequent risk of inflation. Too often  however  they are foreign-currency denominated  where governments face greater constraints on access to credit. Restructuring of financial systems  while indispensable  cannot be implemented quickly. Yes  the potential risks to the banking systems of many Asian countries and the potential contagion effects for their neighbors  and other trading partners  should have been spotted earlier and addressed. But flaws  seen clearly in retrospect  are never so evident at the time. Moreover  there is significant bias in political systems of all varieties to substitute hope (read  wishful thinking) for possibly difficult pre-emptive policy moves  both with respect to financial systems and economic policy. There is often denial and delay in instituting proper adjustments. Recent propensities to obscure the need for change have been evidenced by BIS Review 111/1997 unreported declines in reserves  issuance by the government of equivalents to foreign currency obligations  or unreported large new forward short positions against foreign currencies. It is very difficult for political leaders to incur what they perceive as large  immediate political costs to contain problems they see as only prospective. Reality eventually replaces hope  and the cost of the delay is a more abrupt and disruptive adjustment than would have been required if action had been more pre-emptive. Increased transparency for businesses and governments is a key ingredient in fostering more discipline on private transactors and on government policymakers. Increased transparency can counter political bias in part by exposing for all to see the risks of current policies to stability as they develop. Under such conditions  failure to act would also be perceived as having political costs. We should strongly stress to the newer members of the international financial system -- the emerging economies -- that they should accelerate the restructuring of their financial systems in their own interests. But having delayed timely restructuring  many now find themselves with major shortfalls in bank liquidity and equity capital that put their systems at severe risk of collapse before any full restructuring is feasible. The IMF  the World Bank  and their major shareholders  the developed countries  may wish to facilitate adjustment through temporary loans to governments and the encouragement of private equity infusions to these banking systems. Since any severe breakdown can have contagion effects on a world-wide basis  it is in our interest to do so. These loans must be judged in their entirety. They transform short-term obligations into medium-term loans  but they do so contingent on the country using the time to reform financial systems as well as adopt sound economic policies. Such conditionality accelerates the adjustments in financial systems needed to lay the foundation for resumption of robust  sustainable  growth  while cushioning to some degree the economic effects of the immediate crisis. Assistance without further reform of financial systems and economic policies would be worse than useless since it would foster expectations of being perpetually bailed out. That  in turn  could induce perverse behavior on the part of emerging nations’ governments and of private sector investors in emerging nations. Believing that the international financial community will support these economies  in part by backstopping the obligations they incur  induces investors to commit more than they would otherwise. This has tended in the past to push the expansion of investment beyond prudence -- given the limit of profitable opportunities. As the international financial system becomes ever larger and more efficient  the size of the financial response -- whether to help banks or to add to foreign currency reserves -- may have to be correspondingly larger per unit of crisis  if I may put it that way -- unless we alter our approach. While it is precarious to generalize from one observation  it is likely that the Mexican financial crisis of the 1980s was broader than in 1994-95  but the size of the assistance program  to set things right  was much larger in the latter than in the former case. The reason appears to be that the increased efficiency of the financial system created a larger negative spillover  which had to be contained. Among other developments  the marked shift from bank credits in the earlier crisis  to a more securitized  anonymous  set of liabilities made workouts far more complex. It is  hence  all the more essential that the weaker links in our international financial system  the banking systems of the emerging nations  be strengthened. Preventive programs should be accelerated sufficiently far in advance of the next crisis to effectively thwart or contain it. BIS Review 111/1997 - 8 - Moreover  it is incumbent on governmental policymakers to insure that unstable economic environments do not induce or exacerbate international financial disruptions. But governments and international financial institutions should be brought on the scene only rarely. To do otherwise risks the perverse incentives I spoke of earlier. Markets should be allowed to work. Recent events in Asia have sharpened our understanding of the complexity of today’s international capital flows and  presumably  of similar episodes that may emerge in the future. The rapid integration of national financial systems has fostered the growth of trade and standards of living worldwide. It has also forced a review of the soundness and viability of our burgeoning financial systems. We should welcome such pressures even as they impose challenges to all of us. The end result is very worthwhile having. BIS Review 111/1997

Japan’s economic growth is decelerating further. Although corporate profits  employment and income conditions continue to improve moderately  weak household expenditures since April have gradually begun to affect production  and corporate sentiment is also weakening. With respect to final demand  public-sector investment has been decreasing  and housing investment has also dropped significantly. Personal consumption has continued to be weak on the whole  although the impact of the consumption tax hike has gradually begun to subside. On the other hand  net exports have continued to increase and business fixed investment has been rising moderately against the background of the increase in corporate profits. Excessive inventories are seen in some industries. Owing to weak final demand and inventory adjustments  industrial production has recently declined somewhat. The pace of improvement in employment and income conditions has slowed somewhat. Prices have remained stable on the whole  with the exception of wholesale prices which have declined somewhat. The growth of monetary aggregates has recently slowed. Personal consumption has continued to be weak on the whole. Outlays for travel have been increasing moderately  and there are some signs in the sales of goods which suggest that the impact of the consumption tax hike has gradually begun to subside. However  sales at department stores and supermarkets have been below the previous year’s level  while passenger car sales have fallen below the level recorded in the second half of fiscal 1996 when sales surged  and have not even recovered the levels recorded before then. Among leading indicators of business fixed investment  machinery orders have continued on an increasing trend since early 1997 after having surged in the second half of 1996. Recently  however  orders from non-manufacturing firms have been weak. Construction floor area has followed a moderate recovery trend  albeit with some fluctuations. With respect the seasonally-adjusted annual rate declined in July to 1.24 million  the lowest level since September 1985  following the surge in demand in the second half of 1996 ahead of the consumption tax hike. Housing starts have since remained weak at around 1.3 - 1.35 million. investment  housing starts to housing terms of in Regarding public-sector investment  the amount of public works contracted has followed a decreasing trend reflecting the restrained budget for fiscal 1997. Against the background of steady overseas demand and the yen’s depreciation to date  real exports remained high in the third quarter 1997  although they decreased somewhat from the second quarter when exports showed a significant rise. Real exports rose again in October. Real imports  on the other hand  have remained virtually unchanged on average. As a result  the real trade surplus has been increasing with some fluctuations. Reflecting these developments in exports and imports  the nominal current-account surplus has also been expanding significantly since April 1997. Industrial production has recently been somewhat weak. Production in the third quarter 1997 remained virtually unchanged on the whole. This is because production has been BIS Review 112/1997 - 2 - cut back mainly in the industries with excessive inventories  such as consumer durables and construction-related goods  although production of electrical machinery continued to increase  reflecting steady exports. Production in October and November is expected to decrease as a result of inventory adjustment pressures. With respect to labor market conditions  the unemployment rate has remained at a high level  and the ratio of job offers to job applications has recently eased somewhat. Growth in overtime working hours and nominal wages has slowed slightly reflecting weak production. However  year-to-year employment growth has been moderate but steady. Thus  employment and income conditions continue to improve moderately on the whole  but the pace of recovery has slowed somewhat. Prices remained stable on the whole  excluding the effect of the consumption tax hike. Domestic wholesale prices (adjusted for seasonal electricity rates) have declined to some extent as domestic demand and supply conditions started in construction-related goods. The year-to-year declines in corporate service prices on the whole have been narrowing further owing to the improvement in supply and demand conditions  particularly for real estate rents and information services  although leasing charges continue declining. Consumer prices (nationwide  excluding perishables) rose year to year in September  reflecting the temporary factor; i.e.  a rise in medical charges which resulted from medical insurance reform. Excluding this  however  consumer prices have remained stable at a level slightly above that of the previous year. to ease  particularly Monetary aggregates  measured in terms of year-to-year growth of M2 + CDs average outstanding  declined somewhat in October to 2.7 per cent. Regarding money market rates  the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) has moved at a level slightly below the official discount rate. The 3-month CD rate has stayed at around 0.50 - 0.55 per cent. Against the background of uncertainties about future economic growth  the long-term government bond yield had been declining since the end of May and reached the record low of 1.5 - 1.6 per cent at the end of October  but recently rose to 1.6 - 1.8 per cent. With respect to bank lending rates  the short-term prime lending rate has remained at a record low level of 1.625 per cent since September 1995. The long-term prime lending rate has been lowered since June and reached a record low of 2.3 per cent in October. In these circumstances  short- and long-term contracted interest rates for new loans and discounts (up to September) have stayed at record low levels. On the stock exchange  the Nikkei 225 stock average has been declining since August  partly reflecting uncertainties about future economic growth and the fall in U.S. stock prices  and fell below ¥18 000 in early September. It dropped further after late October as a result of the precipitous decline in Hong Kong stock prices and temporarily reached around ¥15 000  but has recently recovered to around ¥16 000. In the foreign exchange market  the yen moved at around ¥119-123 to the U.S. dollar between September and October. However  the yen later depreciated in early November  owing to growing concerns about future economic growth  as well as the fall in stock prices. Recently  it has moved at around ¥125-128. Meanwhile  the yen started to depreciate against the Deutsche Mark  after having peaked at around ¥62 in mid-August  and has recently moved at around ¥71- 74. BIS Review 112/1997

I am delighted to take part in this discussion on the framework for the single monetary policy in Stage Three. I will address what I consider to be the two main categories of issues in this context: those related to monetary policy strategy on the one hand  and those related to the execution of monetary policy operations on the other hand; in other words  strategic and operational issues. 1. STRATEGIC ISSUES What are the main strategic issues relating to the formulation of the single monetary policy? I will consider in turn: the final objective  the intermediate target  the role of the exchange rate as an indicator  and the starting level of interest rates in the euro area at the end of next year. 1.1. Final objective: a quantified definition of price stability The final objective of the single monetary policy is clearly stated in the Maastricht Treaty: according to article 105  “the primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability”. Only a monetary policy geared towards the objective of price stability can create the conditions for durable and sustainable growth. To reach this objective  three conditions need  in my view  to be fulfilled: firstly  the monetary strategy should be set in a medium-term framework. More generally  the European policy mix should consist both of a medium-term stability-oriented monetary policy and of a medium-term fiscal policy aiming at a balanced budget (or “close to balance” as stated in the Stability Pact).1 This medium-term stability-oriented policy mix is the best we can do to create the conditions for durable growth in the euro area. And it is now widely agreed in the European Union that the policy mix should not give the illusion that it can fine tune the economy; 1 By urging governments to aim for a fiscal position close to balance or in surplus in the medium term  the Stability Pact enables them to let automatic fiscal stabilizers come into play during recessions without exceeding the 3% reference value. In short  it allows them to create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periods that can be drawn on if an asymmetric shock occurs. BIS Review 112/1997 - 2 - secondly  the strategy pursued should provide a clear anchor to inflation expectations. This implies the public announcement of a quantified definition of the final objective of price stability; for instance  the Banque de France aims at an inflation rate not exceeding 2%; thirdly  the strategy should be based on a forward-looking approach. This is because the transmission of monetary policy decisions to the economy takes place with relatively long lags. Estimates of these lags between interest rate changes and their effects on inflation vary between one and two years. As a consequence  central banks have to look ahead before they take monetary policy decisions. A case in point was the recent decision by several continental central banks  including the Banque de France  to raise their main refinancing rates on 9th October. This move was justified by the need to pre-empt inflationary pressures early enough  although current inflation remained low. In my view it is very important to make the public aware of the concept of the “pre-emptive strike”  which is at the heart of central banking. 1.2. Intermediate target: more arguments in favour of monetary targeting  with a caveat In order to provide an anchor to inflation expectations and to look ahead  central banks make public an intermediate target which they commit themselves to respecting. Announcing an intermediate target also enhances the accountability of the central bank. This is why Article 12 of the Statute of the ECB explicitly refers to decisions relating to intermediate monetary objectives as one of the main responsibilities of the Governing Council of the ECB. Two possible strategies have been selected by the EMI Council as potential candidates to be recommended to the ECB  namely monetary targeting and direct inflation targeting.2 In the case of direct inflation targeting  the inflation forecast made by the central bank can be viewed as fulfilling the role of the intermediate target.3 Let me dwell a moment on the choice the ECB will have to make between direct inflation targeting and monetary targeting  unless it chooses to combine elements of both strategies. Inflation targeting stresses the responsibility of the ESCB for achieving and maintaining price stability. However  there are some difficulties in the process of forecasting inflation over the medium and longer term. As Mervyn King recently stated  “such a forecast cannot be a single number. It must be presented for what it is  namely a probability distribution”.4 Furthermore  inflation targeting could imply more formal cooperation with the Government since the latter is in a position to influence price developments. Finally  inflation targeting has admittedly proven useful in progressing towards price stability  as the experience of the United Kingdom has shown. Nevertheless  the track record of inflation targeting is fairly short and has mostly taken place in a context of world-wide disinflation. Monetary targeting (in concrete terms  targeting a broad money aggregate such as M3) clearly indicates the responsibility of the central bank for developments that are more directly under its control and would therefore correspond better to the independence of the ECB. Moreover  it is based on observed information  which makes it more transparent. Finally  2 See the EMI report: “The single monetary policy in Stage Three - Elements of the monetary policy of the ESCB”  February 1997. 3 See  for instance  Lars E.O. Svensson  “Inflation forecast targeting : Implementing and monitoring inflation targets”  European Economic Review 41 (1997)  1111-1146. 4 Lecture given by Mervyn King at the London School of Economics on Wednesday 29 October 1997 to mark the tenth anniversary of the LSE Financial Markets Group. BIS Review 112/1997 - 3 - monetary targeting by the ESCB would be in continuity with the strategy implemented by the Bundesbank since 1975 and by the Banque de France since 1976. However  this strategy hinges on the stability of money demand. Preliminary research has shown that EU-wide money equations often perform better than comparable national equations.5 Nonetheless  this may provide no safe guidance for the starting period of EMU in so far as the move to Stage Three constitutes a change of regime which might lead to breakdowns in empirical relationships. 1.3. Indicators: an important role for the exchange rate and long term interest rate of the euro It is likely that  while avoiding a “looking-at-everything” approach  the ESCB will closely monitor  in addition to the intermediate objective  a broad set of other economic and financial indicators to help assess the risks to future price stability. In this set of indicators  emphasis will probably have to be laid on the exchange rate and the long-term interest rate of the euro  for at least three reasons. Firstly  the euro exchange rate and long-term interest rate will play an important role in shaping monetary conditions within the euro area  together with the level of short-term interest rates that will be steered by the ESCB. Secondly  although the degree of openness of the euro area will be much lower than is currently the case for any EU Member State  with “foreign” trade representing roughly 9% of GDP for the EU as a whole  the area will remain totally open to foreign capital flows. In that regard  I would like to stress that current holdings of French and German securities by non-residents  including cross-holdings  amount to 1 200 billion dollars. This highlights the importance of keeping a high level of confidence in the euro. Thirdly  in spite of the fact that the ESCB will inherit credibility from the participating national central banks  the ECB will have no track record of its own in targeting money or inflation. It will thus have to build up its reputation and pay due attention to those indicators that reflect most directly the level of confidence placed by investors in the euro. Of course  as underlined above  the external value of the euro will not have the status of an intermediate objective and the ECB’s strategy will not be based on exchange rate targeting.6 However  any depreciating trend of the euro would feed domestic inflation through a rise in import prices and  by undermining investors’ confidence  would contribute to the building of risk premia into the euro yield curve. This would have negative consequences for investment  competitiveness  growth and employment in the euro area. So there cannot be any “benign neglect” with respect to the exchange rate. A stable and strong currency contributes to lowering long-term interest rates  which play a crucial role in the financing of the economies in continental Europe. All these reasons point to the need for a strong and stable euro  a currency that will be as credible as the franc  the guilder or the Deutsche Mark. The euro must be  and will be  rock solid. Therefore the exchange rate of the euro  even if not targeted as such  will undoubtedly play an important role as an indicator in the conduct of the single monetary policy. 5 See  for instance  “Money Demand in EU Countries: A Survey”  by F.X. Browne  G. Fagan and J. Henry  EMI Staff Paper n° 7  March 1997. 6 This is different from the current stance in France  where the stability of the exchange rate vis-à-vis the most credible currencies within the ERM is one of the two intermediate targets of monetary policy. BIS Review 112/1997 - 4 - 1.4. The starting level of key interest rates in the euro area Let me say a few words on another strategic question: what will be the starting level of key interest rates in the euro area thirteen months from now? Futures contracts on short-term interest rates reflect the market’s expectations on this issue. But of course don’t expect a central banker to answer this question  one year in advance. I will just mention the Banque de France view on the rationale that should be behind the determination of the starting level of the euro area short-term rates. As you know  we currently observe interest rate differentials between the “core” and more “peripheral” currencies participating in the exchange rate mechanism. Although these spreads have been dramatically reduced in the past two years  due to the remarkable convergence of inflation rates throughout the European Union  some interest rate differentials still exist. They can be attributed partly to differing positions in the business cycle  and partly to differences in credibility. Cyclical differences within the potential euro area should not be overestimated. There is  all in all  a relatively high degree of synchronisation in the business cycle in continental Europe. The convergence criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty certainly played an important role in fostering this synchronisation. Moreover  in the future  differences in cyclical developments will gradually be reduced as policies  structures and behaviour will become more and more similar. Lastly  some persisting differences may well be tolerated as is currently the case between the various regions of the same country or  for instance  between the various member states of the USA. Credibility differences between “core” and “peripheral” currencies result from the different lengths of the track records in terms of stability-oriented policies. It is not the same to have reached an inflation goal of less than 2% for one year as for ten years. One of the benefits that the “peripheral countries” could reap from participating in the first wave of monetary union is to achieve the level of interest rate of the most credible currencies without having yet built up a very long track record. I would like to underline that in Europe  we are not converging towards a kind of average of the market interest rates of the potential euro area. One has to understand that the philosophy of EMU is to organize the convergence of the European countries towards the best possible level of monetary credibility and therefore towards the benchmarks in terms of interest rates. As Mr. Trichet recently stated  “convergence is a benchmarking concept”  not an averaging process. Convergence does not mean that the “core” currencies’ interest rates should go up towards irrelevant “average levels”  but that the interest rates of more “peripheral” countries should progressively converge towards the benchmark level. This benchmark level is currently given by the intervention rates of the Bundesbank and of the Banque de France  both at 3.3%. But of course the benchmark level one year from now could be different from 3.3%. 2. OPERATIONAL ISSUES How will the ESCB operate? As you know  central banks implement their policies through the creation and destruction of central bank reserves  of which they are monopoly BIS Review 112/1997 - 5 - suppliers. This is done in the framework of domestic credit operations as well as foreign exchange interventions. Credit operations are conducted at maturities that extend overnight or beyond  to implement monetary policy  or on an intraday basis  to provide liquidity to payment systems. Therefore  I will consider in turn monetary policy operations  intraday credit operations and foreign exchange operations. I will focus on the following issues: As regards monetary policy operations  how will a single money market rate be attained and what will be the degree of interest rate volatility that the ESCB will be willing to accept? As regards intraday operations  how to cope with the risk of spillover from intraday credit into overnight credit? As regards domestic credit operations as well as foreign exchange operations  how will the principle of operational decentralisation be applied within the ESCB? 2.1. Monetary policy operations: a short-term money market rate as operational target To implement the single monetary policy  the ESCB will pursue an operational target that will normally be a short-term money-market interest rate. Two issues deserve close attention in that regard: the singleness of the money market on the one hand  and the volatility of the interest rate that will be targeted on the other hand. 2.1.1. Single money market rate The single monetary policy will be characterised by the singleness of interest rate levels in the interbank market: from the 1st January 1999 on  a single money-market interest rate will apply throughout the euro area for a given maturity. The issue is  thus  how to attain this single interest rate level. Two requirements will have to be met for that purpose. The first requirement is that  in the context of a single monetary policy that will be implemented in a decentralised manner  there should be a very high degree of harmonisation of instruments and procedures. The EMI and central banks are working relentlessly to this aim. The second requirement lies in the integration of interbank markets and payment systems. As far as interbank markets are concerned  two factors should play a key role: the first factor relates to the various rules market operators have to abide by. These rules apply to counterparts  market makers  brokers  rating agencies and market enterprises such as clearing houses. They take the form of codes of conduct  regulations  master agreements and market standards. An appropriate degree of harmonisation of these market rules should be reached under the aegis of central banks and prudential authorities; the second factor  the use of a single range of reference interest rates would guarantee the transparency of the euro money market. In this respect  short-term maturities are of special interest to central banks. This justifies that they intervene to some extent in the process of elaborating these indicators. As a matter of fact  the EMI has recently agreed that the ESCB should sponsor the computation of an overnight reference rate for the euro area. As regards payment systems  the TARGET system will also contribute to the rapid emergence of a unified money market throughout the euro area. TARGET will connect the domestic real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems operated by the national central banks. It will enable participants to make totally safe cross-border settlements in euro  in real time and at a low cost  thereby facilitating interest rate arbitrage. All large-value payments related to BIS Review 112/1997 - 6 - monetary policy operations will have to process through TARGET. A common closing time for domestic RTGS and the harmonisation of conditions under which intraday liquidity will be provided by national central banks within the euro area should also help prevent any risk of segmentation of the single money market. 2.1.2. Interest rate volatility The EMI has described in various publications the set of monetary policy instruments that will be made available to the ESCB.7 This set will comprise open market operations  standing facilities and minimum reserves. It should fulfil two basic functions: firstly  to enable the ESCB to control efficiently its operational target; secondly  to signal the ESCB monetary policy stance. It should also be consistent with the requirement laid down in the Maastricht Treaty that the ESCB should act in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition  favouring the efficient allocation of resources. In practice  the concrete design and use of monetary policy instruments will depend crucially on the degree of volatility of the short-term rate chosen as the operational target that the ESCB will be willing to accept. This volatility will in turn depend on several factors: the width of the corridor defined by the two standing facilities available to absorb or provide liquidity (the deposit facility for the floor and the marginal lending facility for the ceiling). Under normal circumstances  the two facilities will bound the overnight interest rate. They will operate at the overnight maturity and will be accessible at the discretion of counterparties and for unlimited amounts  provided  in the case of the marginal lending facility  counterparties can supply adequate collateral. A very narrow corridor  allowing very little room for the functioning of the money market  would not be strictly in line with market principles. On the other hand  a very broad corridor would not help contain excessive market volatility. As a consequence  the width of the corridor is likely to be set pragmatically (currently  it is around 2% for most central banks that operate an interest rate corridor similar to the one planned for the ESCB); the frequency of fine tuning operations could be a more discriminating factor for interest rate volatility. Very frequent intervention of the ESCB in the money market would not  in my view  be fully consistent with market principles. Moreover  excessive intervention might complicate the extraction of information from movements in market interest rates  especially at the maturity at which the ESCB would intervene. Intensive recourse to fine-tuning operations might also deprive regular refinancing operations and standing facilities of their signalling effect and be conducive to a centralisation of monetary policy operations; provided they are set at a sufficient level  and include an averaging provision  reserve requirements constitute an efficient buffer against liquidity shocks ; this would help stabilize short-term interest rates over the maintenance period. In turn  setting a fairly high level of minimum reserves might require remunerating them in order not to induce significant delocation or disintermediation; 7 See the two EMI reports “The single monetary policy in Stage Three – Specification of the operational framework”  January 1997  and “The single monetary policy in Stage Three – General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures”  September 1997. BIS Review 112/1997 - 7 - enhancing the signalling effect of the main refinancing operations should also contribute to lowering interest rate volatility. This may best be achieved through the normal conduct of fixed-rate tenders  which send clear signals to the market  rather than variable-rate tenders. The latter may nevertheless be useful in certain circumstances where the ESCB wishes to gauge market sentiment; finally  the communication policy of the ESCB could also play a role in smoothing interest rate volatility. The ESCB will have to publish weekly a consolidated balance sheet. It will also publish the results of its tender operations. It could equally wish to release daily aggregate data on the reserve holdings  if averaged reserve requirements are in place  and on the use of the two standing facilities  as measured in both cases at the end of the previous day. 2.2. Intraday operations: the spillover from intraday credit into overnight credit as a borderline case To ensure the smooth functioning of the TARGET system  the national central banks will provide intraday liquidity to participants in the real-time gross settlement systems. This will be done in the form of fully collateralised intraday credit operations  in the sense that a credit extended during the day falls due before the end of the day. From a monetary policy point of view  such operations create the risk of a spillover of intraday credit into overnight credit that would undermine the control of the ESCB over the euro monetary base. In other words  the spillover of intraday credit into overnight credit in the books of the central bank can be viewed as a borderline case between payment systems and monetary policy issues. Within the euro area  this risk will be limited as end-of-day debit positions will be automatically considered to be a request for recourse to the marginal lending facility  i.e. an ESCB monetary policy instrument that bears a penalty interest rate. Outside the euro area  a problem arises as the RTGS systems of non-participating countries will be connected to TARGET  whereas no central bank currently gives non-residents access to its monetary policy instruments. As a consequence  different mechanisms are being prepared in order to prevent intraday credit  if granted to non-euro area NCBs  from spilling over into overnight credit. These mechanisms include the limitation  possibly to zero  of the amount of intraday liquidity non-euro area NCBs could receive  a system of penalties and sanctions applied in case of overnight overdrafts and an early closing time for participants in RTGS systems in non-euro area countries. The decision on which mechanisms to implement will be taken by the ECB. 2.3. Foreign exchange operations Foreign exchange operations include foreign reserve assets management on the one hand  foreign exchange intervention on the other hand. The ESCB will hold and manage two different types of foreign reserve assets: those that will be transferred from the national central banks to the ECB; according to the Statute  the ECB shall be provided with such foreign reserve assets up to an amount equivalent to euro 50 billion; BIS Review 112/1997 - 8 - and those that will be kept by the national central banks; the management of these foreign assets will be subject to guidelines issued by the ECB to ensure that the operations of national central banks do not interfere with the monetary and exchange rate policies of the euro area. These guidelines will include prior approval by the ECB for transactions exceeding thresholds to be specified and will also apply to member states’ transactions with their foreign exchange working balances. The ESCB will have the technical capacity to conduct  if need be  foreign exchange intervention in order to counteract excessive or erratic exchange rate fluctuations of the euro against the major non-EU currencies (e.g.  the US dollar). The need for intervention could also arise either in the context of G7 concerted operations or within the framework of the ERM II. To this end  the ESCB will use the pool of foreign assets transferred from the NCBs to the ECB. The framework that has been designed for domestic as well as foreign exchange operations allows the ESCB to build on the expertise that NCBs have acquired over the years and to make an extensive use of existing operational capacities in NCBs (dealing room  front office  back office). Common sense dictates making use of equipment  human resources and expertise currently available at NCBs. 2.4. A decentralised execution of operations A key feature of the single monetary policy is indeed that it will be decided in a centralised manner  by the Governing Council of the ECB  and executed in a decentralised manner  by the national central banks. In my description of operational issues within the context of the single monetary policy  I have made numerous and concrete allusions to this reliance of the ECB on the national central banks  in the areas of monetary policy  payment systems and foreign exchange operations. This organisation scheme of the ESCB is in line with the principle of subsidiarity laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. According to this principle  the ESCB shall have recourse to the national central banks to carry out its operations  to the extent deemed possible and appropriate. Consistently with this principle of decentralisation in the execution of the ESCB’s operations  the counterparties (credit institutions) will keep their accounts with the NCBs. Operational decentralisation within the ESCB will be in the very interest of the System. In this regard  let me quote the President of the EMI  Mr. Duisenberg: “Reliance on the infrastructure and operational experience built up by the national central banks will prove a valuable asset. Given that the ESCB needs to be cognisant of differences between financial market participants and structures in the EU  operating through the national central banks will ensure that it has the best possible knowledge of market conditions throughout the euro area”.8 The credibility of the ECB as the decision-making centre will by no means be undermined by this decentralised scheme. It will not depend on the technicalities in the execution of operations. The credibility of the ECB will crucially depend on its ability to 8 Speech by the President of the European Monetary Institute  Dr. W.F. Duisenberg  at the conference on “European Monetary Union : Prospects for European Financial Markets”  held in Paris  22 October 1997.

r971208g,1997-12-08,https://www.bis.org/review/r971208g.pdf,Mr. Yam looks at the future of Hong Kong as a financial services centre for China and the Asian region (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  28 Oct 97),Speech by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  Mr. Joseph Yam  JP  to Coopers and Lybrand Financial Services Conference in Hong Kong on 28/10/97.,Mr. Yam looks at the future of Hong Kong as a financial services centre for China and the Asian region Speech by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  Mr. Joseph Yam  JP  to Coopers and Lybrand Financial Services Conference in Hong Kong on 28/10/97. I have been asked to speak on Hong Kong’s role as a financial services centre for China and the Asian region. As you know  many of the economies of the Asian region  including of course the mainland of China  have been undergoing a rapid process of financial liberalization. This has brought tremendous benefits to the region  through providing the mechanisms for channelling savings into investments  domestically and internationally  thus promoting growth and development of the region. The process has brought substantial risks to the region as well  as clearly you have witnessed in the past few months when financial turmoil spread in the region. 2. Notwithstanding the financial problems now being faced by the region  the balance of opinion is still firmly that financial liberalization is of long-term benefit. The correct response to such problems is clearly  at least for the immediate future  to take the right medicine and implement the necessary economic adjustment programmes  prescribed if necessary by the International Monetary Fund. Indeed  this has very much been the focus of recent attention when one looks at individual economies in this region that have been subject to financial turmoil. But prevention is always better than cure. Much attention will also be required  in the fullness of time  to make sure that the financial systems through which financial intermediation takes place are robust so that the benefits of financial liberalization could be maximized and the associated risks could be minimized and prudently managed. 3. As a financial services centre which operates with a highly liberal regime  Hong Kong has important roles to play in all this. There is not enough time to go into details here on this occasion  so I shall just identify three general areas for your consideration. 4. The first area concerns financial intermediation within individual economies  in other words  the channelling of domestic savings into domestic investments. Here Hong Kong  at this stage at least  largely only plays an advisory role. The less liberalized financial systems in this region are very much dominated by domestic financial institutions  particularly in the banking market. Further  domestic politics and a desire to protect domestic financial institutions from undue competition are such that liberalization to admit foreign financial institutions to take part in domestic financial intermediation would only proceed at a pace dictated by these considerations. For example  it will  I think  take some time and patience for Hong Kong-based banks to gain a physical presence in the mainland of China  be allowed access to renminbi 5. But Hong Kong’s expertise in developing markets  in building the market infrastructure and  where necessary  in regulating markets and supervising market participants to uphold the efficiency and integrity of financial markets is there for everybody to see and tap. Furthermore  we know the region  and particularly in the case of the mainland of China  I would argue that we know a lot more than others  and so we are in an advantageous position to perform an advisory role. And the financial community of Hong Kong  including the regulators  have been actively playing that advisory role. I can speak from experience here  although it would not be appropriate for me to be too specific. In many of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s BIS Review 112/1997 - 2 - contacts with  for example  our counterparts in the mainland of China  the subjects for discussion are increasingly on financial affairs in the mainland rather than those in Hong Kong. 6. I believe that in performing this advisory role effectively we will open up opportunities for the financial services industry of Hong Kong. As markets are built and liberalized in these neighbouring economies  I am confident that our own financial institutions will gain access to the business in those markets through establishing a presence there  and eventually compete  I hope  on a level playing field with the domestic financial institutions. In any case  the need for a physical presence with a large branch network in the provision of financial services may soon become a thing of the past with the advancement of telecommunications and information technology. It is still early  I think  to come to a definitive view  but the prospects are that electronic money and the use of the internet for banking and other financial services are breaking down geographical boundaries. Barriers to entry and restrictive practices may lead to the diversion of business to offshore markets in locations with liberal practices. 7. The second area concerns financial intermediation in the international dimension  involving the flow of savings into investments across international boundaries. Hong Kong as a financial services centre has a business role of providing the markets  in banking  debt and equity  supported by other efficient financial services and the rule of law  to facilitate the international flow of funds in this region. Our markets have the freedom  the liquidity and the integrity to attract international investors managing institutional savings to come here and those in need of funds to raise them here. The opportunities in this region  in particular in China  are enormous  and international investors would have a preference to operate in markets in which the rules of the game are transparent and familiar to them  and are of internationally accepted standards. And that means coming to Hong Kong. 8. The banking market in Hong Kong is of course a very international one  with a total of 182 licensed banks  151 of which are incorporated outside Hong Kong. 81 of the largest 100 banks in the world are licensed in Hong Kong. Collectively they provide a wide range of banking and other financial services  not just for Hong Kong but for the region as a whole. The banking sector of Hong Kong is reputed to be amongst the most efficient and profitable in the world. 9. Hong Kong’s debt market  which has developed quite rapidly in the past eight years  is also playing a significant role in the region. Financial intermediation through the debt market is still relatively underdeveloped in the region  but the prospects are good. As the very substantial savings of the region is increasingly institutionalized through the establishment of provident funds and pension funds  the demand for debt securities would grow  perhaps much faster than that for banking and equity instruments. At the same time  the huge investments envisaged for the development of the physical infrastructure in the region will require much debt financing  thus increasing the supply of debt securities. With the first class infrastructure in our newly developed debt market  Hong Kong is in a very favourable position to take advantage of these good prospects. 10. Hong Kong’s equity market is of course one of the largest and most liquid in the world  and  notwithstanding recent volatility  is the favourite market for institutional investors and for those wishing to raise funds. One popular area recently is  of course  the use of Hong Kong’s stock market for raising funds by Chinese state-owned enterprises. Up to late October  38 enterprises from the mainland of China have made their initial public offerings in Hong Kong in the form of the issue of “H” shares. These shares were bought by investors both BIS Review 112/1997 - 3 - in Hong Kong and overseas. It is important to note that when mainland enterprises sought to be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange  they are required to comply with all the listing rules and other relevant regulations in Hong Kong. No favouritism or preferential treatment has been or will be given to mainland companies. Thus  in addition to fund raising  the listing of mainland companies in Hong Kong facilitates the upgrading of corporate governance of these listed companies in line with the international standards practised in Hong Kong. Through this process  Hong Kong has also played a strategic role in the reform of the state-owned enterprises in the mainland. 11. The third area concerns the management of systemic risks arising from but not limited to financial liberalization in this region. There is clearly identified a need for much greater monetary cooperation in this region  and here Hong Kong has been actively playing  and hopes to continue to play actively  a promotional role. We have been instrumental in promoting greater Asian monetary cooperation  not just in the more visible efforts to deal with the financial turmoil we all are facing  in one way or another  but also the upgrading and standardization of supervisory practices  and the building of the financial infrastructure of this region to facilitate safe and efficient international financial intermediation in this region. Our ability to play this role no doubt enhances Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre  which is consistent with the requirement laid down in the Basic Law. 12. We took the initiative on the wake of the Mexican crisis in early 1995 to draw the central banking fraternity of this region together to talk about Asian monetary cooperation  which led first to a set of bilateral agreements for the provision of liquidity to each other in case of need. This was followed by the establishment of three working groups to share knowledge and expertise on financial market development  central bank operations and banking supervision issues. Separately  we are also promoting the establishment of linkages of the financial infrastructures of economies in this region  such as payment systems and debt clearing systems  to facilitate the efficient and safe flow of funds amongst ourselves. These efforts will have long-term benefits for the region  both in terms of the maintenance of financial stability and the development of the financial sector. 13. While important progress is being made  this has recently been overshadowed by financial turmoil in the region  and the focus of attention has as a consequence been diverted to the provision of credit to assist Asian economies in need in making structural adjustments. We had the financial package for Thailand  and there have since been many ideas put forward for a general facility of some sort. These are being actively considered and we are taking an active part in the discussion  although there are currently still quite significant differences of opinion. The position that we are taking is that whilst regional solidarity is highly appropriate for a region with increasing economic  trade and financial integration and increasing interdependence  any regional financial arrangement must be structured with regard to international standards and practices. It would not be appropriate  for example  for a regional institution  if there is to be one  to prescribe medicine  along with financial assistance  that is different from those prescribed by the International Monetary Fund. It would immediately be seen as a soft window for financial support  thus creating moral hazard problems. I am hopeful that well-structured arrangements will emerge in due course. Certainly the climate is right and the momentum is there. 14. Perhaps I should take this opportunity to put the recent financial turmoil in Asia in a global perspective. First  the world is in very good economic shape. World economic output is estimated by the IMF to expand by 4-4½% in 1997 and 1998  the strongest pace in a decade. In the OECD countries  especially in the US  there is solid growth with low inflation  BIS Review 112/1997 - 4 - while we are seeing signs of broad-based recovery in Europe. Only in Asia have we seen a slowing of growth  but the growth rates have still been high by world standard and last year Japan grew by 3.6%  the fastest since the late 1980s. 15. Second  because of high global liquidity and low inflation  asset markets around the world are at record levels. Capital flows have increased with globalization  and added to record high stock and bond prices. The fact that Europe has recently raised interest rates  and the Fed is considering whether to pre-emptively raise rates to prevent wage-push inflation  has made the financial markets much more nervous despite the growth environment. This explains why the financial volatility in Asia has become global in nature. It is very flattering to know that Hong Kong can move even the mighty US and European markets  as much as the other way around. 16. Third  Asian fundamentals  and especially Hong Kong fundamentals  are strong. But there have been different degrees of strength in Asia with respect to the fundamentals. The adjustments in exchange rates of currencies in this region reflect partly the market perception of fundamentals. But as I said recently at the Per Jacobsson lecture  there is no perfect exchange rate regime. Some economists think that a shift from a rigid exchange rate regime to a free float would result in lower interest rates to ease the interest rate pain. However  recent experience in Asia has shown that the market demands even higher interest rates than before under a floating rate regime due to the need for hedging  since there is a perception of higher credit risks and exchange rate risks. 17. I interpret the currency turmoil in the region not as exchange rate volatility  but as a painful but necessary adjustment in the real economy (manifested through the financial system and markets) to the new world of greater competition. In essence  we must all work harder to get greater productivity gains to meet the new challenge. No one can afford to be complacent in this global world. To the extent that the free market is demanding higher interest rates because there is a reverse flow of capital from Asia to the OECD markets  we will all have to bear the pain and adjust accordingly. 18. And not all interest rate pain is bad. Higher interest rates would increase savings in Hong Kong and bring inflation down further  thus increasing our competitiveness. To the extent that higher interest rates would reduce house prices  they would also make housing more affordable. 19. The currency board system with a fixed exchange rate is appropriate for a small and highly externally-oriented economy like Hong Kong. It further imposes a strict discipline on public finances. Hong Kong runs budget surpluses  not deficits. On the other hand  a floating exchange rate adds huge volatility to the businesses of the external sector of the economy  requiring further costs in terms of hedging. A volatile exchange rate by contrast does not have quite such serious implications for a large and relatively less externally-oriented economy like Japan  where external trade accounts for less than 20% of GDP. In Hong Kong  with external trade accounting for 285% of GDP  a volatile exchange rate creates huge uncertainties for much of our livelihood  thus undermining our fundamental competitiveness. 20. Hong Kong has always understood that there is no free lunch. We have built up our strengths and our savings through sheer hard work. If there is greater competition out there  we will adjust our quality and our skills accordingly. As accountants in a service economy  you know very well that you cannot price yourselves cheaply in order to compete. Our reputation depends on our ability to deliver quality service that is value for money. This is the strength for Hong Kong. Let BIS Review 112/1997 - 5 - me conclude by merely giving you the assurance that our linked exchange rate system  which has served us so well in the past 14 years  is here to stay.

Flow of Funds in Japan  1996 Summary In 1996  the gross amounts of fund-raising and financial investment by the domestic nonfinancial sector (comprising the corporate business  personal  and public sectors) during the year both decreased from the previous year  remaining at low levels compared with the past. The sector’s fund-raising through borrowing declined  while funds raised through government bond issues reached a record high. As for financial investment  there was a larger net redemption of securities (excluding investment trusts) than in 1995  and the net investment in insurance products narrowed significantly. In the corporate business sector  the financial surplus marked a record high. This was because (1) cash flow improved in excess of the continued growth in fixed investment  due mainly to a recovery in sales; and (2) interest payments decreased  reflecting low interest rates. The sector’s fund-raising was at its lowest level since 1956 -- the third year of compilation of the flow of funds accounts -- primarily on account of a net decline in loans  which was more significant than the previous year  particularly in those from private financial institutions. At the same time  financial investment also declined from the previous year. Such overall sluggishness of fund-raising and financial investment activities can be attributed to the persisting balance-sheet adjustment pressure. In the personal sector  the financial surplus narrowed  the ratio of financial surplus to nominal GDP marking a record low. This was because (1) consumption expenditures increased by a larger margin than the improvement in employees’ income; and (2) housing investment increased due to the effects of low interest rates and a surge in demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate in fiscal 1997. Both fund-raising and financial investment fell below the previous year’s levels  with conspicuous declines in investments in long-term assets such as insurance  securities  and trusts. The outstanding amount of financial assets in the personal sector reached ¥1 200 trillion for the first time at the end of 1996. In the public sector  a large financial deficit remained  due to expanded public-sector investment during the first half of the year. Fund-raising through government bond issues  almost all of which were purchased by the financial sector  marked a record high. Profits and Balance-Sheet Developments of Japanese Banks in Fiscal 1996 Overview Operating profits1 of Japanese banks2 in fiscal 1996 amounted to ¥6.4 trillion  5 percent lower than in the previous year. This decline reflects a decrease in the net bond-related 1 “Operating profits” signifies earnings from core banking operations  arrived at by subtracting “general loan-loss provisions ” “ general and administrative expenses” and “expenses for debenture issuance” from the total of “net interest income” (e.g.  interest received/paid) for loans and BIS Review 113/1997 - 2 - profits and in the net interest income of city banks. Excluding a temporary factor3 which contributed to an increase in profits on trust accounts  the decline in operating profits from the previous year was about 10 percent. Loan write-offs and loan-loss provisions4 marked approximately ¥7.6 trillion (including trust accounts)  which is the second highest level following fiscal 1995 when the jusen (housing loan companies) were liquidated. This suggests that most banks continued to give high priority to solving the problem of nonperforming loans. Net stock-related profits5 were no more than about ¥1.0 trillion  approximately ¥2.9 trillion lower than the fiscal 1995 level  due to substantial stock write-downs resulting from the fall in stock prices. This reflects the fact that banks’ balance sheets have become more exposed to volatility in stock prices because of a rise in the book values of stocks which resulted from recent cross transactions -- sets of purchases and sales transactions on the same stocks in order to acquire unrealized capital gain. As the loan write-offs and loan-loss provisions virtually matched the total of operating profits and stock-related profits  recurring profits and net income reached close to zero levels  although this represented an improvement from the previous year. On the Relationship between Monetary Aggregates and Economic Activities in Japan: A Study Focusing on Long-Term Equilibrium Relationships Introduction This paper empirically analyzes the relationship between monetary aggregates and economic activities in Japan using actual data and focusing on long-term equilibrium relationships. Long-term time-series data from the 1960s to 1996 are used in the analysis in order to observe long-term relationships between the most commonly used monetary aggregate  M2+CDs  and macroeconomic indicators  such as GDP  rather than limiting the analysis to short-term relationships during the past year or two.1 In addition to long-term relationships  the discounts  deposits and securities)  “net fee and commission income” (e.g.  fees and commissions received/paid) and “net other operating income” (e.g.  net profits related to bonds and foreign exchange). 2 “Japanese banks” or “banks” in this article refers to “All Banks ” comprising the member banks of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan  which consists of city banks  long-term credit banks  seven trust banks (excluding foreign-owned trust banks and trust banks that started business after October 1993)  the 64 member banks of the Regional Banks Association of Japan (hereafter referred to as regional banks)  and the 65 member banks of the Second Association of Regional Banks (hereafter referred to as regional banks II). However  calculated figures exclude data for Hyogo Bank (the present Midori Bank)  Taiheiyo Bank (the present Wakashio Bank)  and Hanwa Bank. 3 Specifically  the temporary factor here refers to profits resulting from withdrawals from special reserve funds held by trust banks. The withdrawal profit resulted from a revision of a government ordinance that reduced the ratio of funds to set aside for the special reserve funds (from 3 percent of principal to 0.5 percent of principal). These are accumulated to provide for situations in which the value of a loan trust falls below the value of the principal. The trust banks applied part of the profit to write off nonperforming loans in trusts  and the remainder to be accounted as trust fees and be registered in the banking accounts as net fee and commission income. 4 This includes not only loan write-offs  but also transfers to special loan-loss accounts (provisions)  losses from the sales of nonperforming loans to the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC)  and renunciations of claims. 5 Stock-related profits/losses are calculated by subtracting from “gains on stock-selling operations” the sum of “losses from stock-selling operations” and “stock write-downs”. 1 Note that the sample period includes the period when M2+CDs underwent large fluctuations  i.e. from the latter half of the 1980s to the early 1990s. BIS Review 113/1997 - 3 - stability of the money demand function and also the lead/lag relationships between monetary aggregates and other macroeconomic indicators are tested. The conclusions of the paper can be summarized as follows. (1) When developments in M2+CDs and other macroeconomic indicators are viewed in the long term  fluctuations in nominal M2+CDs have a relatively stable relationship with movements in nominal GDP. This can also be confirmed by applying an econometric technique called “cointegration analysis”  which suggests that there is a long-term equilibrium relationship between the two. On the other hand  the relationship between M2+CDs and prices -- which along with real GDP make up nominal GDP -- has changed since the latter half of the 1980s  in the sense that fluctuations in prices have clearly diminished relative to those of M2+CDs. (2) A relatively stable money demand function can be estimated  based on the above long-term equilibrium relationship and incorporating factors for short-term fluctuations. At least in the sample period  the mechanism of short-term fluctuations has been relatively stable in M2+CDs  GDP  interest rates  and asset factors  as represented by the money demand function. (3) An analysis in terms of lagged cross correlation on the lead/lag relationships between M2+CDs and other macroeconomic variables reveals that M2+CDs basically leads nominal and real GDP  domestic private demand  and prices. However  there are differences in results across sample periods that cannot be ignored. (4) Similar analyses are conducted  from the standpoints of conclusions (1)-(3) above  on selected monetary and credit aggregates other than M2+CDs  and on monetary aggregates obtained by partially changing the components of M1 and M2+CDs. The results show that these aggregates did not have more stable relationships with macroeconomic indicators than did M2+CDs. (5) The above results suggest that  in analyzing monetary aggregates  it would be effective to use the long-term equilibrium relationship between M2+CDs and GDP as well as the money demand function incorporating the relationship. In interpreting the empirical results using the statistical techniques  however  it is necessary to bear in mind the following limitations: (a) Long-term equilibrium relationships indicate only the average relationship in the long run  and hence considerable deviations from equilibrium values may arise in the short term; and (b) There still remains a possibility that the long-term equilibrium relationships or money demand functions derived from the previously observed data may change  as a result of a large shift of funds caused by deregulation and other structural changes in the financial markets in the future. Checklist for the Year 2000 Problem Introduction BIS Review 113/1997 - 4 - The Bank Supervision Department of the Bank of Japan compiled the following checklist (the original is in Japanese) to assist bank examiners in assessing the adequacy of financial institutions’ risk management framework for addressing the Year 2000 problem (hereinafter simply “the Problem”).1 On August 19  1997  the checklist was also distributed to financial institutions to help them in their own evaluation of their action plans. The checklist emphasizes the significance of each financial institution’s understanding and awareness of the Problem  and calls for the commitment of each institution  including the top management  to its action plans. In proceeding with the action plans  each institution is advised to fully assess the effects of the Problem  carefully arrange the scheduling of the plans  and complete renovation and testing prior to the implementation of the action plans. The checklist also stresses the importance of other matters including (1) the monitoring of the progress as to the implementation of the action plans  (2) the scrutiny of legal responsibilities of outside vendors  and (3) the establishment of contingency plans. 1 Many computer operating systems and applications use six-digit codes for dates -- date fields -- comprising two digits for the year  two digits for the month  and two digits for the day (for example  December 31  1999 reads 991231). With such a coding system  the code for the year 2000 will be “00 ” which may be interpreted as the year 1900  not 2000. This will cause errors in date-sensitive calculations and other issues. Such problems are referred to as the Year 2000 problem. If measures are not taken to address the problem  normal operations of financial institutions will be disrupted  which would lead to disturbances in payment and settlement systems nationwide  the effects of which may spread to other industries.

The Managing Director of the IMF described the Mexican economic problems of 1994/95 as “the first crisis of the 21st century”  with the implication that this was something new and  more ominously  perhaps there would be more of them. Before the new century has dawned  there has now been a series of similar problems  concentrated in the region of most interest to us -- East Asia. This is relevant to a conference on finance and banking  because the financial sector in each of these countries has been the key factor in the crisis and is central to its resolution. Those who spend time thinking about financial sectors and how they evolve over time may find some interest in examining what went wrong  why it went wrong  and how it might be put right. It is also of considerable importance to Australia -- not just for the effect on our economy (which is hard to quantify at this stage)  but also for the opportunity it presents for Australia to deepen its engagement with the region. What went wrong? The problems in Asia  like the Mexican crisis of 1994  exhibit a variety of symptoms  with the most prominent being large falls in exchange rates and equity markets. But exchange rate changes of this size are not unknown in other countries which have not experienced the trauma currently underway in Asia. In Australia in the mid-1980s the exchange rate fell by 35 per cent  and in the early 1990s it fell by close to 25 per cent. Nor is this uncommon internationally. Even the mighty US dollar went up and down by amounts like this in the mid-1980s. More recently  Japan  between April 1995 and April 1997  experienced a depreciation of similar size. These exchange rate changes may well have been a trigger which set off a chain reaction of other events. But by themselves  the exchange rate changes would have been an uncomfortable policy problem  not a crisis. An uncomfortable problem became a crisis because the weakness in the exchange rate infected the financial sector. This occurred through a variety of channels -- in some cases  banks had borrowed heavily in foreign currency; more often  the borrowers were the non-bank business sector. As the exchange rate fell  their burgeoning foreign exchange obligations pushed the enterprises under water  and they defaulted on their debts to the domestic banking sector. At the same time  foreign lenders  who had felt protected by the foreign currency denomination of the loans  now realised that a fall in the exchange rate increased their credit risk  and so they pulled credit lines or failed to roll over short-term debt. This exchange rate shock impinged on financial systems which already had fracture lines and structural tensions. There were a number of specific weaknesses -- connected lending  government-directed loans  poor credit evaluation  lack of transparency  and inadequate prudential supervision. The situation was sustainable if growth and capital flows were maintained  but was not sustainable in the harsh world in which we live  where confidence is fragile  capital flows are flighty  and the stabilising forces of the “fundamentals” are slow to assert themselves. BIS Review 113/1997 Why did it happen? - 2 - The first point that should be made is that the praise which had been heaped on these countries for several decades is entirely understandable. These countries have been high savers  budgets have been balanced or in surplus  inflation has been reasonably well contained  and exports had been the dynamic driving-force of growth (with the globalisation that this implies). They ran high current account deficits because  however much they were saving  they were investing even more. Who could  ex ante  have criticised the broad-brush developments in the financial sector? Open capital markets were a merit-badge of economic maturity and a requirement for entry into the industrial-nations’ economics club -- the OECD. Not only were these markets generally opened up and linked in with international capital markets  they embraced this eagerly  including the latest sophisticated products of the financial sector. Equity markets burgeoned and the arcane products of Wall Street were readily available. International agencies urged further and faster deregulation  commercial financial interests (domestic and foreign) were eager to stake out a role for themselves in the fast-growing sector  and sophistication in financial products was seen as being as important as having the latest in industrial technology. While it is easy enough now to see the fracture lines and lack of resilience of these financial sectors  it was less easy to predict the outcomes beforehand. The transition from a regulated financial system to a deregulated financial system is intrinsically difficult. Under the best of circumstances  it was inevitably going to be accompanied by false starts and mis-cues. The pace of growth of credit is difficult to evaluate in a world where you would expect it to be growing quickly because financial repression (McKinnon’s phrase) is ending. The transition leaves the financial system quite fragile during the process. There is a fair bit of evidence that problems have arisen for almost every country during the transition  with the problem usually taking the form of excessive lending as each institution in the deregulated financial sector competes vigorously for its share in the new world. In the process  poor loans are made and asset prices are bid up. These two things come together in mutual reinforcement when the problems come to a head. Lenders who had used collateral as their main loan-evaluation technique find their security to be illiquid and inadequate. At the same time  it is almost inevitable that the process of financial deregulation will run ahead of the capacity of the prudential supervisors to devise a suitable regulatory framework. To start with  the climate of deregulation is often inimical to the regulators. This was certainly our experience in Australia during the 1980s: as we tried to put in place the basis of some “rules of the game” for the new deregulated financial sector  many people who should have known better were calling this “re-regulation by the back-door”  and criticising us for being out of sympathy with the brave new world of deregulation. This experience seems to have been repeated elsewhere. Managers at all levels have been dealing with products and systems with which they are unfamiliar (but to admit this would disqualify them from participating in this exciting new world)  and commercial imperatives encouraged them “to boldly go where no man has gone before”. As we look at the problems of foreign currency borrowings in some of our Asian neighbours  one might recall the similar experience with Swiss franc loans in Australia during the 1980s  with the (fortunate) difference that these were  in a macro sense  quite small for Australia. There is another difficult issue here for the authorities. Even when problems were identified  there was the classic dilemma well known to prudential supervisors -- do you “blow BIS Review 113/1997 - 3 - the whistle” on the problem and precipitate a crisis (for which you will surely be blamed)  or do you quietly work behind the scenes to try to avert the perceived problem  in the hope that you will succeed or the problem will go away of its own accord  but knowing that if it doesn’t  it will be a bigger problem than if you had precipitated it early on. No credit is given for precipitating a crisis early  but there is plenty of blame for being present at the scene of the crime. So it is not surprising that there was  beforehand  a certain amount of hand-wringing about financial sector weaknesses  but this was muted background noise in the general enthusiasm to embrace the new world. What might be done? The first point that should be made here is that the main burden for getting things sorted out again clearly rests with these countries themselves. The related point here is that  for some  (to borrow the catch-cry from positive-thinking management texts) “this isn’t a problem  it’s an opportunity”. For some of these countries  the process of institutional reform may be like punctuated development in evolutionary theory  where progress takes place in jerky stages  with a crisis such as this causing people to focus on the issues and to reform weaknesses. In this view  countries can come out of this trauma stronger than before. It seems quite likely that some countries will be better than others at turning these problems into opportunities. While part of the reaction to these problems must be institutional strengthening of the financial system  there remains a question whether the broad thrust of macro policy -- and  by implication  the spanking rates of growth which these countries have achieved over the past couple of decades -- is sustainable. To put this more specifically  is it possible to achieve the sorts of integration with international markets  the large inflows of capital which went with this and the rapid transformation of economies  without leaving these economies vulnerable to the sorts of changes of sentiment that we have seen in recent months? The constraint on growth is not the conventional one of resources and technology. The constraining factor here is just how resilient can the financial sector be made: the more robust it can be made  the faster these countries will be able to travel. We know the historical experience of Singapore  which ran current account deficits averaging 10 per cent of GDP for more than two decades. We know  too  that this was an important element in the extraordinary progress that Singapore has made. We know  however  that large current account deficits were one of the elements which made the other ASEAN countries vulnerable in recent years (and this vulnerability has always been a concern in Australia  too  despite the academic case that current account deficits resulting from private sector decisions were matters between “consenting adults” and therefore not something with which policy should concern itself). Analysts have pointed to the problems caused by the US-dollar-fixed exchange rates that prevailed in these countries until recently. They argue that  if exchange rates had been allowed to appreciate  credit growth would have been better contained and the economy held on a tighter rein. Greater exchange rate flexibility is surely an element in the new policy regimes. But the lesson of recent months is that  once a fixed exchange rate is freed  it can move by large amounts. Over-shooting is par for the course. All the more reason why a resilient and robust financial sector must be in place if flexible exchange rate regimes are now the norm. institutional improvement -- making accounting systems better  tightening up legal and bankruptcy systems  involves careful  slogging  time-consuming Much of this BIS Review 113/1997 - 4 - improving disclosure  and strengthening and deepening experience in prudential supervision. One point that might be noted is that some capital flows seem to create more vulnerability than others  so there is a case for discouraging short-term flows and encouraging direct investment/equity and longer-term bond flows. in talent The best these countries should go the core financial institutions -- principally banks -- even if this means that the latest whiz-bang innovation of the financial rocket scientists remains unexploited. This is not to argue for stepping back from financial development -- on the contrary  these countries must move forward to deepen markets. But the resources should go into design and implementation of a robust financial architecture and -- to continue the analogy -- useful design parameters are simplicity  a strong basic structure  and attention to detail. into One useful objective is to put the banking system in a central position as the guardians on the gateway of investment. If a project has to pass the scrutiny of a bank which will hold the loan on its balance sheet  there is still no guarantee of success  but maybe the chances are improved. What is clear is that private businesses have mis-assessed the risk they faced  tempted by attractively-lower foreign currency interest rates but not sufficiently aware of the need to worry about the variance of the prospective cash flows. An experienced banker might have helped. Of course  this will only work if the banking system is allowed to do its job  untrammelled by connected or directed lending. Banks cannot provide “due diligence” scrutiny on loans which they were required to make. The first priority  always  is to get the banks -- the core of the financial system -- sorted out quickly. The need is to keep the process of financial intermediation flowing: it is the life-blood of the real business sector. The problems are not  in fact  examples of some new “crisis of the 21st century”: they are  at heart  the old problems of bank collapses and the remedy is  in principle  well established. Restoring confidence is the critical factor and for this (as Bagehot observed) central banks should “lend freely  but at a penalty rate”. Insolvent institutions must be separated from the solvent  dealt with  and the remaining institutions supported. None of this is easy. Intractable problems of moral hazard exist  but this should not be allowed to paralyse action. Serious money will be required to fix the problems. Experience over the past couple of decades shows just how expensive these financial sector rescues can be. The 1994 Mexican problems have cost about 12-15 per cent of GDP; the Nordic countries spent 4-8 per cent of their GDP fixing their problems a few years ago; even the S&L problems in the United States (merely a small sub-group of the financial sector) cost around 3 per cent of GDP to sort out. But the cost of failing to address these problems decisively can be more painful still -- a long drawn-out period of financial introspection and inertia which severely retards real activity. A positive point is the strong fiscal positions (and therefore low government debt outstanding) of these countries  so the capacity to fund the restructuring exists. All this is  clearly  largely a matter of domestic policy  with the costs to be borne mainly by taxpayers in these countries. In a more speculative vein  let me return to the idea that what we are witnessing is a problem of the 21st century  and acknowledge that  while what we see has many of the characteristics of an old-fashioned financial sector crisis  it has one important new element -- the major role played by international capital flows. Domestic financial intermediation takes place within a broad set of “rules of the game”  laid down by prudential regulators. There is no international analogue of this. Over time  it can develop  as countries implement consistent rules of prudential supervision  perhaps along the lines of the BIS Review 113/1997 - 5 - BIS Core Principles. This might -- together with better information on private capital flows and cross-country position-taking -- provide a response to this new element of the current problems -- the role of large-scale capital flows. What relevance is it to Australia  and to this audience (Australian and overseas)? We acknowledge our stake in the outcome  with two-thirds of our exports going to East Asia (including Japan). Australia is taking part in the IMF-co-ordinated facilities for Thailand  Indonesia and Korea. These funds help restore confidence and help the process of adjustment. We will use our relationships -- via our regional central bankers group EMEAP and  in due course  the newly-formed Asian Surveillance Group -- to provide examples of how prudential systems work elsewhere  analysis of how the specifics might be done in particular countries  technical assistance where it can be useful  and -- the most difficult and subtle task of all -- understated and understanding support for the reform elements who have the task of fashioning a stronger financial sector. A last word directed specifically at this audience. Some of you come from the countries involved: I wish you well in the vital task ahead. For the rest of us  is this  too  not a problem but rather an opportunity? The countries to our near north are going to be devoting considerable resources to strengthening their financial sectors. I hope some of you will find a role for yourselves in this process  and by doing so will look back on this as an opportunity to strengthen our links with our northern neighbours. BIS Review 113/1997

What can monetary policy do to help the economy reach its full potential? Today  we meet against a backdrop of some uncertainty in the international economy. I would like to begin my remarks with an assessment of what the recent financial and economic events in Asia could mean for Canada. The nervousness and uncertainty that spread around the world in the wake of the problems in Southeast Asia highlight the growing interactions among national economies and financial markets. The events in Asia also underscore how crucial prudent macroeconomic policies and sound financial sector management are to good economic performance. The measures that have been taken  mainly through the International Monetary Fund  are important first steps for the affected Asian economies in dealing with their problems. I believe that these measures have helped to contain at least some of the potential spillover effects to other countries and  thus  they are helping to settle global financial markets. Canada’s direct trade links with Southeast Asia are not large. However  those with Japan and Korea are more important to us  and there are also potential effects on our other trading partners that need to be taken into account. The problems in Asia and their possible implications for the world economy are probably the source of some of the recent softening in world commodity prices. Because of the importance of commodities to Canada  this softening has been a factor behind the recent weakness in our currency. Our judgment at this stage is that the overall impact of these recent developments on Canada does not look likely to be large. However  we are sensitive to the fact that some industries and regions will be affected more than others. I can assure you that we will continue to monitor the situation very closely  in view of the uncertainty that remains about the likely outcome of events in Asia. Even with this uncertainty  however  recent suggestions that there is a risk of worldwide deflation strike me as being very pessimistic. Developments in Asia will slow somewhat the pace of global economic expansion. But as long as the world’s largest economy  the United States  is pressing against its capacity limits  with the possibility of upward pressure on its inflation rate  the risk of worldwide deflation looks rather remote. Certainly  from Canada’s perspective  the U.S. economy is by far the most important influence. I would now like to turn from these recent events and talk about the Bank of Canada’s longer-term strategy for monetary policy. In any discussion of strategy  the place to start is with the objective. In conducting monetary policy  the Bank of Canada’s ultimate objective is to help the Canadian economy achieve its full potential. And that means more jobs and rising standards of living. I am sure that all Canadians would agree that this is an appropriate objective. BIS Review 113/1997 - 2 - The Bank pursues this objective through a policy aimed at keeping inflation low and stable. Today  I would like to explain why such a policy is the best way to achieve Canada’s full economic potential and to extend the current expansion. In this connection  I will review the recent U.S. experience in this area -- an experience that I find both relevant and instructive. On the road to full economic potential The performance of the Canadian economy over the past 25 years has been rather disappointing. The economy has suffered from recurring bouts of boom and bust  and unemployment has been very high. The growth of productivity and  thus  the improvement in our standard of living have been very gradual. Canada is not unique in this respect. Most industrial countries have shared this experience to varying degrees. And that includes the United States. Since the early 1990s  however  the U.S. economy has performed remarkably well and substantially better than other industrial economies. That country has enjoyed a solid  six-and-a-half-year-long economic expansion. Over that period  employment growth has averaged 2 per cent per year. The unemployment rate has declined from a peak of 8 per cent to under 5 per cent. Household incomes have risen by 2½ per cent a year (after correction for inflation). U.S. businesses have become highly competitive  even in areas where prospects did not look all that good at the end of the 1980s. What’s more  inflation has been on a declining path  albeit with some help from temporary factors (such as an appreciating U.S. dollar  declines in energy prices  and the slack in overseas economies). Why has the U.S. economy done so well? Are there any lessons here for Canada? Lessons from the U.S. experience There are  undoubtedly  a number of factors behind this striking U.S. performance. But  to me  there are at least two that seem to have been particularly important: the early adjustment of that economy to changing technology and globalization; and the credible  low-inflation policy pursued by the U.S. central bank. The Americans started adjusting in earnest in the 1980s to the new realities of heightened global competition and rapidly changing technology. As a result  they are ahead of most other industrial countries on that score. And  with improving productivity and highly competitive enterprises in a wide range of sectors  the U.S. economy has been able to expand rapidly and to support rising employment on a sustained basis. But taking full advantage of that improved potential for economic growth has required a climate of confidence in monetary policy. Bringing inflation down in a credible manner has helped to create that climate. And because of this  the U.S. monetary authorities have been in a position to encourage the economy to test its full capacity to produce  to create jobs  and to support rising incomes. This would not have been possible in an environment of high inflation and high inflation expectations. In such an environment  businesses  workers  and investors respond swiftly to any signs of demand pressures by pushing up prices  wages  and interest rates. And this has the effect of undermining the sustainability of the economic expansion. BIS Review 113/1997 - 3 - What precisely did the U.S. Federal Reserve do? In the early 1990s  problems in the banking sector were restraining the economic recovery in that country by limiting access to financing and undermining confidence. To counter these “headwinds”  as Alan Greenspan called them  the Fed responded by providing a high degree of monetary stimulus. Then  in early 1994  when it became evident that the economy had started to pick up steam and move ahead on its own  the Fed began withdrawing the excess monetary stimulus. This timely  pre-emptive action to moderate monetary stimulus accomplished two things. First  it sent a strong reassuring signal to investors  businesses  and consumers that the Fed would not let inflation break out as the economy surged ahead. Indeed  after short-term rates went up in 1994-95  long-term rates declined  as investors became more confident that the economic expansion would remain non-inflationary and  thus  sustainable. Second  the pre-emptive action helped avoid the need for stronger  more disruptive  tightening later on. The less-accommodative monetary conditions that have prevailed since then certainly have not stopped the U.S. economic expansion dead in its tracks  as some had feared at the time. On the contrary  the expansion has continued at a healthy pace. And with widespread belief in the Fed’s commitment to low inflation  there has been some room to explore the possibility that capacity has improved. As a result  the Fed has been able to set monetary conditions that have encouraged output and employment to expand at rates that in the past could not have been sustained. And both unemployment and inflation have come down at the same time. To be sure  with tightening labour markets  there is some risk of an increase in inflation pressures in the United States. Thus  one cannot rule out the possibility that the Fed may have to raise interest rates somewhat further at some point. But any future increases in interest rates should not have to be large and may be conditioned by the implications of the recent international developments I mentioned earlier. What parallels can we find in all this for Canada? The recent Canadian experience The adjustment in Canada to the forces of technological change and globalization has run behind that in the United States. Because the restructuring was delayed  Canada had to respond in a more dramatic fashion. We had to do more and do it faster. More importantly  our fiscal situation was more precarious and required stronger medicine. As a result  we ended up with more pronounced short-run disruptions and more catching up to do in terms of output and employment. These difficult but necessary adjustments in the private and public sectors of our economy were Canada’s parallel to the U.S. headwinds. To compensate for the direct impact of these adjustments  as well as for their indirect effects on consumer confidence  the economy needed a substantial amount of monetary support. The Bank of Canada was able to provide such support once investor concerns about Canada’s fiscal and political problems began to subside in late 1995. We did that by systematically reducing interest rates over the next year or so. As in the United States in 1991-92  short-term rates in Canada were brought down during 1995-96 from over 6 per cent to about 3 per cent -- their lowest level in over 30 years. At the same time  the Canadian dollar has BIS Review 113/1997 - 4 - been relatively low  providing support to the export sector. When we put interest rates and the exchange rate together -- as we must in order to correctly gauge the amount of monetary stimulus -- it is clear that monetary conditions in Canada have been exceptionally stimulative for well over a year. This was entirely appropriate while our economy was still struggling against the headwinds of private and public sector restructuring. To return to my automobile analogy of recent speeches  we needed to put the “pedal to the metal” to buck those headwinds and get the economy going. The monetary stimulus has done its job. The economy has been gathering speed and absorbing unused capacity. We now expect it to have expanded by about 4 per cent from the end of 1996 to the end of 1997. The diminishing effects of fiscal restraint  along with evidence of continued strong demand  output  and money growth  suggest another year of healthy expansion in 1998. Thus  in terms of the economic cycle  we are about where the Americans were in 1994. What should the role of monetary policy be in the period ahead? As we move towards full capacity over the next year or so  the task for monetary policy will be to try to ensure that this process goes smoothly and that inflationary pressures do not re-emerge. I want to make it clear that the Bank does not see an overheated economy at this point  nor a threat of inflation lurking around the corner. There is still unused capacity and  thus  room for strong expansion for some time yet. But  with monetary policy actions taking between one to two years to have their full effects on the economy  we always have to look ahead. And we have to ask  What sort of monetary support will the economy need at that point? The measures -- especially the fiscal measures -- needed to restructure our economy will be largely in place by then. Thus  monetary policy will no longer need to compensate for these sources of restraint on demand. By gradually easing off on the monetary gas pedal  we can steady our economy at a safe cruising speed down the road. As we look still further down the road  we will face other important issues. How well will our economy perform once it reaches full capacity? How rapid can growth be and still be sustainable? And how far can we reduce our unemployment rate? Given the complexity of the factors affecting economic performance  it is not possible to make precise predictions on these matters. Much will depend on the flexibility  efficiency  and productivity of Canadian enterprises; on how effectively new technology is used; on the skills  training  and adaptability of our labour force; on our ability to control costs; and on the initiative and ability of Canadian businesses to develop new products and new and expanded foreign markets for those products. Still  I believe that the restructuring that has taken place in the Canadian economy provides good reason to think that our potential to grow and create jobs is the best we have had in years. I also believe that continued credible fiscal and monetary policies have an important role to play. BIS Review 113/1997 - 5 - The best contribution monetary policy can make towards achieving that potential is to ensure that the economic expansion remains sustainable over the medium term. As we have learned over the past 25 years  a sustained expansion is not possible unless we can avoid a resurgence of inflation and the painful cycles of boom and bust that go with it. Thus  the challenge for monetary policy will be to set monetary conditions at levels that allow the economy to expand at a pace that makes full use of its production capacity and at the same time preserves low inflation. It is by conducting monetary policy prudently during the upswing that the Bank can assure Canadians that inflation will not break out when the economy begins to operate at levels that push against capacity limits. If we succeed in providing that confidence  we will then have the flexibility that will allow us to carefully explore the limits of growth and employment without immediately putting the economic expansion at risk. Concluding remarks Let me summarize my main messages to you today. The extraordinary monetary stimulus of the recent past has accomplished its task. It has supported the economy through a period of difficult but necessary restructuring. As the impact of this restructuring subsides and our economy enters a phase of self-sustaining expansion  we will no longer need the same amount of monetary stimulus. Because the economy takes time to respond to monetary policy actions  the Bank has to focus on the future. This means taking steps early to ensure that we will reach full capacity at a sustainable cruising speed. Of course  projections of future economic trends need constant reassessment. And that is particularly true at a time of nervous financial markets and uncertainty about the implications that events in Asia may have for the world economy. As I said earlier  the Bank continues to monitor the current global situation carefully. Aside from any complications that could arise from a prolonged period of international instability  the Canadian economy in the next year or so should absorb the unused capacity that we now see. At that point  we will begin to see concrete evidence of the kind of payoffs we are going to get from the economic restructuring process we have been through. With low inflation and a sound fiscal position  the Canadian economy is now in a better position than it has been for years to weather the impact of unexpected international developments and to make progress in generating higher incomes and employment.
