Philipp Hildebrand: Financial market turbulence and the economic 
outlook 
Summary of a speech by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of 
the Swiss National Bank, at the Handels- und Industrieverein des Kantons Bern, Burgdorf-
Emmental section, Burgdorf, 25 October 2007. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bankâ€™s website (www.snb.ch). 
 It is very difficult to assess how the shifts in the credit markets triggered by the US sub-prime 
mortgage market will impact on the real economy. As a result, the uncertainties with regard 
to the economic outlook have increased considerably.  
The  evaluation  of  structured  credit  products,  some  of  them  very  complex,  is  based  on 
models.  Because  of  the  difficulties  this  evaluation  poses,  the  market  for  such  products 
gradually disappeared. The uncertainty as to the degree of exposure of individual banks in 
the structured credit market led to illiquidity in the unsecured interbank market.  
Central  banks  around  the  world  have  reacted  to  this  unusual  situation  with  injections  of 
liquidity. An adequate supply of liquidity to the economy is essential for our economic system 
to function.  
A favourable aspect of the situation was the fact that the credit market turbulence occurred at 
a time when the global economy and the Swiss economy were both in good shape.
