Durmuş Yılmaz: Recent economic and financial developments in Turkey 
Speech by Mr Durmuş Yılmaz, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at 
the press conference for the presentation of the Inflation Report, Ankara, 27 October 2009. 
 Distinguished Guests and Members of the Press, 
Welcome to the press conference held to convey the main messages of the October 2009 
Inflation  Report,  one  of  the  most  important  communication  tools  of  the  inflation-targeting 
regime of the Central Bank. 
The  report  typically  summarizes  the  economic  framework  addressed  in  monetary  policy 
decisions, elaborates global and domestic macroeconomic developments and presents the 
medium-term  inflation  forecasts,  which  have  been  revised  in  view  of  previous  quarter 
developments, along with the monetary policy stance. 
I  would  like  to  start  my  speech  by  underlining  once  more  that  the  Central  Bank’s 
assessments on inflation outlook and economic activity, which I will share with you in detail 
shortly,  should  be  considered  in  the  light  of  existing  global  conditions.  The  global  crisis, 
which erupted in developed markets and spread across the world during the last quarter of 
2008,  has  continued  to  affect  the  economic  outlook,  albeit  less  forcefully,  during  the  third 
quarter of 2009. In this period, data releases on activity indicated that the recovery continues 
to  gain  traction  with  growth  forecasts  being  revised  upwards  after  sustained  downward 
revisions  (Figure  1).  However,  improvements  in  many  leading  indicators  are  still  tentative, 
problems  across  credit  markets  linger,  and  employment  remains  in  a  precarious  state,  all 
suggesting that recovery is likely to be anemic and protracted.

Inflation developments 
1.  
Distinguished Members of the Press,  
Inflation developments observed in the first three quarters of 2009 were shaped around the 
framework that I have already mentioned. The crisis was characterized by a steep drop in 
economic  activity,  which  was  mainly  driven  by  shrinking  external  demand,  tighter  financial 
conditions, and rising precautionary saving. The sharp contraction in economic activity and 
the  collapse  of  commodity  prices  have  brought  down  inflation  rates  across  the  world,

including  Turkey.  In  this  respect,  after  displaying  a  sharp  decline  in  the  first  half  of  2009, 
annual  inflation  maintained  a  downward  trend  in  the  third  quarter  to  become  5.27  percent 
breaching the lower limit of the uncertainty band set (Figure 2).

Although processed food and energy were instrumental in the downward trend of inflation, 
core  goods  and  services  inflation  also  hovers  around  historic  lows  (Figure  3).  In  the  third 
quarter, the disinflation process lost pace due to the tax measures to restore fiscal balances.

In  addition,  phased-out  tax  cuts  on  durable  consumption  goods  were  one  of  the  featured 
developments  with  regard  to  consumer  prices  in  the  third  quarter.  All  in  all,  the  decline  in 
prices of core goods remained below previous levels (Figure 4).  
In the third quarter of the year, the rate of increase in services prices continued to slow down 
in  the  face  of  weakening  domestic  demand  and  the  fading  of  high  base  effect  caused  by 
supply shocks in the previous year. Seasonally adjusted data suggest that the main trend of 
services  inflation  is  at  historically  low  levels,  this  prevailing  across  all  sub-groups.  It  is 
especially noteworthy that monthly rent inflation continued smoothly along a downward path 
(Figure 5 and Figure 6). Nevertheless, we expect that the services sector will enter a gradual 
recovery  trend,  however  prices  will  continue  to  increase  at  a  moderate  pace  in  the  last 
quarter of the year.

As I believe that movements of core inflation indicators are essential to better understand the 
underlying trend of inflation and to evaluate developments  more effectively, I would like to 
further elaborate on these developments. Core inflation indicators maintained their downward 
trend  in  the  third  quarter.  By  September,  annual  inflation  measured  by  the  CPI  excluding 
energy,  unprocessed  food,  alcoholic  beverages,  tobacco  and  gold  (H  index)  became  2.44 
percent,  while  annual  inflation  measured  by  the  I  index,  which  excludes  processed  food 
prices,  became  3.37  percent.  In  this  period,  although  the  partial  withdrawal  of  tax  cuts  on 
durable  goods  pushed  core  inflation  indicators  upwards,  seasonally  and  tax  adjusted  data 
indicate that the underlying trend of inflation is still low (Figure 7 and 8). Here I would like to 
highlight that the said indicators might increase, albeit modestly, in the upcoming period with 
the expiration of temporary tax cuts in October.

Accordingly, in the last quarter, inflation expectations displayed a downward trend in all time 
frames. Yet, this trend continued less forcefully and the expectations curve flattened as the 
maturities  extended  (Figure  9).  Currently,  expectations  for  end-2009  are  anchored  at  5.40 
percent, well below the target. On the other hand, end-2010 inflation expectations, calculated 
by  averaging  inflation  expectations  for  12  and  24-months  ahead  remain  slightly  below  the 
target (Figure 10).

 BIS Review 143/2009
The sharp fall in inflation observed over the past year is not peculiar to Turkey. Inflation rates 
have plummeted all over the world since the peak of the crisis due to downward pressures 
arising from demand and cost conditions. Although there has been a slight increase in rates 
with the removal of the high base effect of the previous year in the third quarter (Figure 11), 
core inflation data indicate that the main trend of inflation in both developed and emerging 
markets is downward (Figure 12).

Monetary policy response 
2.  
After  commenting  briefly  on  inflation  developments,  I  would  now  like  to  cover  the  policies 
pursued by the Central Bank during the last quarter. 
Anticipating that inflation would decrease sharply following the last quarter of 2008, when the 
global financial crisis deepened, the Central Bank of Turkey (CBRT) focused on alleviating 
the  potentially  harsh  impact  of  the  global  financial  crisis  on  the  domestic  economy. 
Throughout  this  process,  the  CBRT  has  delivered  sizeable  cuts  in  policy  rates,  while 
providing liquidity support to facilitate the smooth operation of credit markets. In this respect, 
the CBRT continued to cut interest rates in the third quarter, bringing the cumulative rate cuts 
to 1000 basis points since November 2008. Therefore, the CBRT lowered policy rates more 
than  any  other  emerging  market  central  bank  since  the  intensification  of  the  global  crisis 
(Figure 13 and 14).

Data releases on inflation and economic activity since the inception of the rate cutting cycle 
have vindicated these preemptive monetary policy decisions, and thereby strengthened the 
impact  of  policy  decisions  on  expectations,  gradually  bringing  government  bond  yields  to 
historically  low  levels  on  the  back  of  improvement  in  risk  premiums  (Figure  15).  CBRT’s 
effective  communication  policy  and  management  of  expectations,  along  with  market 
perceptions  indicating  that  the  Medium  Term  Program  (MTP)  released  in  September  is 
consistent  and  realistic,  played  a  key  role  in  bringing  down  government  bond  yields.  This 
downward trend particularly accelerated after providing a medium-term policy perspective in 
the July Inflation Report.

Market  interest  rates  in  all  maturities  are  declining.  It  is  noteworthy  that  long-term  yields 
declined more than shorter-term yields and displayed a flatter yield curve (Figure 16 and 17).

The downward trend in market interest rates also reverberated on medium term real interest 
rates causing real market interest rates to go down compared to the second quarter and to 
hover around historically low levels (Figure 18). Besides, policy rate cuts and improvements 
in global risk perceptions have started to have favorable effects on credit markets. In fact, 
consumer  loan  rates,  which  were  reacting  rather  sluggishly  to  policy  rate  cuts,  have 
displayed  a  significant  decline  in  this  period  (Figure  19).  Moreover,  the  CBRT  reduced 
Turkish  lira  reserve  requirements  in  October,  in  order  to  further  alleviate  the  tightness  in 
credit  conditions,  and  thus  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  policy  rate  cuts.  Within  this 
framework, the recovery in credit markets is expected to continue gradually throughout the 
last quarter. However, the effectiveness of the credit channel in supporting economic activity 
is  still  partly  restrained  owing  to  the  ongoing  tightness  in  lending  standards  for  small  and 
medium-sized enterprises.

Against this background, referring to the partial improvements in labor and credit markets, I 
would like to remind you once more that the Monetary Policy Committee indicated after the 
October meeting that a slowdown in the pace of rate cuts would be considered at the next 
meeting  depending  on  economic  data  and  developments.  However,  it  was  also  noted  that 
lingering  problems  across  the  global  economy  were  still  a  concern  and  that  uncertainties 
regarding  the  strength  of  the  recovery  remain.  Taking  these  factors  into  account,  I  should 
reiterate that it would be necessary for monetary policy to maintain an easing bias for a long 
period of time. 
Inflation and monetary policy outlook 
3. 
Distinguished Members of the Press and Esteemed Guests, 
After summarizing inflation and monetary policy developments in the third quarter of 2009, in 
this part of my speech, I would like to share with you the evaluation of the inflation outlook 
and  monetary  policy  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Turkey  in  the  upcoming  period.  Firstly,  I  will 
briefly describe the economic framework underlying these forecasts. Then, I will outline the 
Central Bank’s inflation forecasts presented in the Inflation Report, which will be posted on 
our website shortly. 
Although  the  recovery  in  global  economic  activity  is  expected  to  be  slow  and  gradual,  the 
perception that the worst part of the crisis is over has continued to support optimism across 
financial markets and increased the appetite for risk during the third quarter. Parallel to the 
recovery  in  global  risk  perceptions,  the  risk  premia  of  emerging  markets  fell  rapidly  and 
reached  almost  pre-crisis  levels  (Figure  20).  In  this  period,  the  perception  was  that  many 
emerging markets, which had been considered in the pre-crisis period as ‘highly risky’, were 
not  as  risky  as  envisaged.  Favorable  statements  of  credit  rating  agencies  regarding  the 
sovereign rating of Turkey – one of the leading countries among these emerging markets – 
alongside  the  relatively  lower  level  of  Turkey’s  risk  premium  compared  to  other  emerging

markets – as was the case throughout the crisis – have confirmed the decline in Turkey’s 
relative riskiness (Figure 20).

In the third quarter of 2009, in line with the improvement in global risk perceptions, capital 
inflows towards emerging markets through portfolio movements increased and currencies of 
the  said  countries  began  to  appreciate  (Figure  21).  Turkey  was  no  exception  to  this 
development. This development prevented the hikes in commodity prices in the third quarter 
to translate into domestic unit costs.

Distinguished Members of the Press, 
The  second  quarter  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  release  was  broadly  in  line  with  the 
outlook presented in the July Inflation Report. Within this framework, the GDP decreased by 
7 percent in the second quarter of 2009 compared to the same quarter last year (Figure 22). 
Meanwhile, the GDP in seasonally adjusted terms displayed a significant upswing compared 
to  the  previous  quarter  bringing  an  end  to  the  persistent  contraction  in  economic  activity 
observed  since  the  second  quarter  of  2008  (Figure  23).  While  domestic  consumption 
demand  rose  markedly  during  the  second  quarter  mainly  owing  to  the  fiscal  stimulus 
package,  external  demand  remained  weak.  The  continued  run-down  in  inventories  limited 
production and resource utilization and therefore curbed the effect of the recent rapid growth 
on  inflation.  Moreover,  high  unemployment  rates  have  continued  to  suppress  domestic 
demand. Accordingly, aggregate demand conditions have continued to support disinflation.

On  the  production  side,  value  added  fell  year-on-year  across  non-farm  sectors.  The  3.1 
percent  value  added  in  services  provided  the  most  negative  contribution  to  GDP  growth 
(Figure  24).  On  the  spending  side,  the  adverse  impact  of  private  demand  on  annual  GDP 
growth  substantially  decreased  compared  to  two  preceding  quarters.  Meanwhile,  the 
unfavorable  trend  in  private  investment  expenditures  continued  in  the  second  quarter  and 
private investment became the demand component that made the most negative contribution 
to GDP growth (Figure 25).

Compared to the previous quarter, the primary determinant of growth in the second quarter 
was  private  consumption  demand  that  displayed  an  upswing,  mainly  owing  to  the  fiscal 
stimulus package (Figure 26). While assessing whether the pick-up in private consumption 
demand  indicates  a  lasting  recovery  trend  or  not,  it  would  be  wise  to  evaluate  trend 
discrepancies in different sub-components and interpret data pertaining to the third quarter 
accordingly.  Second  quarter  national  accounts  data  confirm  that  the  pick-up  in  private 
consumption  demand  stemmed  mainly  from  fiscal  stimulus-driven  advanced  demand  for 
certain  goods  categories.  Meanwhile,  the  demand  for  goods  that  were  not  subject  to  tax 
reductions stayed almost constant (Figure 27).

BIS Review 143/2009 
 Recently  issued  data  indicate  that  this  trend  continued  in  the  third  quarter  as  well  and 
consumption demand has adopted a weaker course following its marked increase during the 
second  quarter.  Although  private  investment  is  expected  to  increase  slightly  in  the  third 
quarter, the low capacity utilization rate and the high uncertainty in demand is expected to 
hold  back  the  recovery  in  investments.  Accordingly,  total  aggregate  domestic  demand  is 
expected to stay flat in the third quarter, after increasing significantly in the second quarter 
(Figure 28).

Data  pertaining  to  the  third  quarter  indicate  that  external  demand  remained  weak  and  the 
negative  contribution  of  net  exports  to  quarterly  growth  persisted.  The  course  of  external 
demand will be determined by the outlook of the speed and timing of global recovery. The 
medium-term outlook for global growth indicates that the GDPs of developed countries would 
not reach the pre-crisis level for an extended period of time. Within this framework, external 
demand is expected to continue to suppress aggregate demand for quite some time (Figure 
29).

In  the  June-August  period,  non-farm  employment  increased  for  the  first  time  since  the 
second  quarter  of  2008,  in  seasonally  adjusted  terms.  Parallel  to  this  development,  the 
upward trend in unemployment rates reversed. In the mentioned period, unemployment rates 
increased  in  annual  terms  while  they  decreased  compared  to  the  second  quarter  in 
seasonally adjusted terms (Figure 30). Indicators such as capacity utilization rates and per 
capita hours worked suggest that resource utilization remains low throughout the economy. 
Given  that  ample  slack  would  continue  to  be  an  obstacle  to  investment  and  employment, 
recent  signs  of  improvement  in  employment  data  is  not  expected  to  turn  into  a  significant 
recovery, suggesting that unemployment is likely to remain elevated for an extended period 
of  time.  Therefore,  unit  labor  costs  and  domestic  demand  would  continue  to  support 
disinflation.

As I have mentioned before, the tightness in credit conditions has been on an easing trend. 
Accordingly, developments in the credit market would begin to support domestic economic 
activity as of the fourth quarter of the year and the impact of monetary policy is expected to 
be more visible in the medium term. However, the rising domestic borrowing requirement of 
the  government,  ongoing  problems  in  the  global  economy,  and  elevated  levels  of 
unemployment would continue restraining credit expansion. 
Overall, economic activity is expected to recover gradually, with annual growth rates posting 
positive  figures  starting  in  the  last  quarter.  However,  resource  utilization  is  anticipated  to 
remain  below  the  long-term  average  for  some  time.  In  this  context,  our  medium-term 
forecasts  envisage  that  the  output  gap  –  albeit  closing  faster  than  envisaged  in  the  July 
Report – will remain disinflationary until mid-2012. 
Although  global  economic  growth  is  expected  to  follow  a  gradual  path,  commodity  prices 
continued  to  follow  a  rising  trend  in  the  third  quarter,  with  the  growing  perception  that 
recovery  is  on  the  way  (Figure  31).  Accordingly,  oil  prices  were  above  our  assumption  of 
USD  60  per  barrel  in  the  third  quarter  (Figure  32).  Therefore,  the  previous  assumption  of 
end-year oil price levels are revised up from USD 60 per barrel to USD 70 for 2009, from 
USD 70 to USD 75 for 2010, and from USD 70 to USD 80 for 2011 and thereafter. Moreover, 
in  line  with  oil  prices,  imported  input  prices  are  also  assumed  to  increase  gradually 
throughout the forecast horizon in response to the slow recovery in the world economy.

The course of food prices is another important assumption for inflation forecasts. Contrary to 
the upward trend in previous years, the seasonally adjusted food prices displayed a decline 
in the third quarter (Figure 33). This change was mainly driven by the decline in unprocessed 
prices fuelled by prices of fruits and vegetables decreasing at a faster pace than seasonal 
averages.  Unprocessed  food  prices  had  displayed  an  upswing  in  the  first  half  of  the  year. 
Deceleration  in  annual  inflation  in  processed  food  prices  continued  as  well  and  prices  fell 
compared to the same period of the previous year for the first time in the history of the index 
(Figure 34). The July Inflation Report envisaged food inflation to be 7.5 percent at the end of 
2009  and  6  percent  for  the  following  years.  However,  better  than  expected  outcomes 
regarding food prices necessitated a downward revision in food inflation to 5.8 percent for 
end-2009, while the projection of 6 percent was maintained for the following years.

Given  the  current  economic  climate,  assumptions  on  foreign  economic  activity  remain 
increasingly  important  in  building  medium-term  forecasts.  Therefore,  as  I  have  mentioned 
earlier in my speech, better-than-expected growth figures regarding the second quarter and 
continued recovery in leading indicators pertaining to economic activity in the third quarter 
together has bolstered perceptions that the worst part of the crisis is over. Accordingly, while 
producing medium-term forecasts, assumptions pertaining to global economic activity have 
been  revised  slightly  upwards  compared  to  those  in  the  July  Inflation  Report  and  the 
forecasts  were  made  on  the  assumption  that  external  demand  would  remain  weak  for  an 
extended period (Table 1). 
Furthermore, revised forecasts envisage world interest rates to remain low for an extended 
period of time. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the consistent framework outlined in 
the  Medium  Term  Program  (MTP)  will  be  implemented  and  further  enhanced  by  structural 
measures that would strengthen fiscal discipline. In this respect, it is assumed that the fiscal 
stance  will  remain  expansionary  –  but  less  so  than  the  one  in  2009throughout  2010,  and 
fiscal tightening will gradually be adopted starting from 2011. Moreover, in line with the MTP, 
it  is  envisaged  that  the  rising  debt-to-GDP  ratios  will  reverse  their  course  steadily  starting 
from 2011, and hence the risk premium would not display any significant changes throughout 
the forecast horizon.

Against  this  background,  assuming  a  limited  amount  of  further  easing  and  constant  policy 
rate until the end of 2010, medium-term forecasts suggest that, with 70 percent probability, 
inflation will be between 5.0 and 6.0 percent with a mid-point of 5.5 percent at  the end of 
2009, and between 3.9 and 6.9 percent with a mid-point of 5.4 percent by the end of 2010. 
Furthermore,  inflation  is  expected  to  decline  to  4.9  percent  by  the  end  of  2011  and  to  4.8 
percent by the third quarter of 2012 (Figure 35).

* Indicates a confidence interval of 70 percent  
 
While  better  than  expected  outcomes  in  food  prices  necessitated  a  downward  revision  in 
food inflation for end-2009, this effect was offset for the medium term by the upward revision 
of the assumptions for global economic activity and oil prices, and therefore, there has not 
been a major change in our forecasts for 2010 and 2011.  
The revised forecasts indicate that the output gap will not close soon, supporting disinflation 
even when policy rates are kept at low levels for an extended period. It is worthy to note that 
the sharp fall in inflation in the first half of 2009 created significant base effects. This would, 
ceteris paribus, lead to volatility and some mild increases in annual inflation rates until mid-
2010  (Figure  35).  Afterwards,  as  the  impact  of  tax  hikes  and  price  adjustments  would 
gradually disappear, inflation is expected to trend downwards starting from the second half of 
2010, stabilizing around 5 percent over the  medium term. It is critical to note that inflation 
would  be  less  persistent,  and  thus  economic  recovery  much  smoother,  should  economic 
agents take these forecasts as a benchmark in their pricing decisions.  
It should be emphasized that any new data or information regarding the inflation outlook may 
lead to a change in the monetary policy stance. Therefore, I would like to underline that the 
assumptions  on  the  future  policy  rates  underlying  the  inflation  forecast  should  not  be 
perceived as a commitment on behalf of the CBRT.  
Risks 
4.  
Distinguished Members of the Press, 
In  the  last  part  of  my  presentation,  I  would  like  to  mention  the  risks  with  respect  to  the 
inflation  outlook  in  the  upcoming  period  and  provide  some  information  pertaining  to  the 
probable monetary policy strategy should these risks materialize.

Although recent data releases indicate that the worst is over, concerns regarding the health 
of  the  global  economy  remain.  In  particular,  ongoing  problems  in  credit  and  labor  markets 
keep  the  downside  risks  for  global  activity  on  the  agenda.  Should  the  global  conditions 
deteriorate  again  and  consequently  delay  domestic  recovery,  the  CBRT  would  consider 
another cycle of rate cuts.  
The fact that the crisis itself and policy responses are unprecedented in recent history poses 
risk  to  the  inflation  and  monetary  policy  outlook.  It  is  impossible  to  benefit  from  past 
experience in gauging the impact of recent global monetary policy measures on economic 
activity and other fundamental variables. Although not having resorted to explicit quantitative 
easing in the post-crisis period eliminates some of the risks in case of Turkey, it should still 
be noted that the full impact of the cumulative easing of 1000 basis points since November 
2008 is yet to be seen. In other words, although the baseline scenario does not envisage any 
policy  rate  hikes  for  an  extended  period,  it  is  important  to  closely  monitor  the  impact  of 
policies to ensure a timely response to any development not envisaged within the framework 
I drew in my assessments above. 
Another  possible  scenario  is  a  surge  in  capital  inflows  to  emerging  markets  owing  to  the 
relative improvement of credit risk across these countries. Ample liquidity with low cost driven 
by expansionary fiscal and monetary policies on a worldwide scale, coupled with rising risk 
appetite,  have  led  to  an  increase  in  the  demand  for  financial  assets of  emerging  markets. 
Current low levels of resource utilization in the Turkish economy imply that a fall in the cost of 
imported inputs may be reflected on to the consumer prices rapidly, suggesting that a further 
acceleration in capital inflows may exacerbate downward risks on inflation. The realization of 
such a scenario may lead to temporarily lower policy rates compared to those envisaged in 
the baseline scenario. 
Esteemed guests, 
The  CBRT  will  continue  to  monitor  fiscal  policy  developments  closely  while  formulating 
monetary  policy.  Enhancing  the  framework  set  out  in  the  Medium  Term  Program  (MTP) 
through further structural adjustments to strengthen fiscal discipline will support the relative 
improvement of Turkey’s sovereign risk. Should the goals set out in the MTP are achieved 
we  consider  that  it  may  be  possible  to  keep  policy  rates  in  single  digits  throughout  the 
forecast horizon. 
Increasing budget deficits worldwide continue to pose upside risks to inflation expectations 
and  thus  to  global  market  interest  rates  in  the  long  term.  Our  medium-term  inflation  and 
monetary policy outlook envisage that recovery in global economic activity follows a slow and 
protracted  course,  while  saving  rates  keep  rising  and  global  interest  rates  remain  at  low 
levels  for  an  extended  period.  However,  huge  budget  deficits  particularly  in  developed 
countries, which are triggered by fiscal stimulus packages adopted in the face of the global 
financial  crisis,  besides  the  lack  of  a  clear  exit  strategy  from  these  policies,  create  upside 
risks regarding medium-term global interest rates. Countries with relatively sounder banking 
systems  and  prudent  fiscal  policies  would  be  more  resilient  against  these  risks.  In  this 
context, I would like to once more underline the significance of fiscal discipline in the current 
conjuncture.  
The course of oil and other commodity prices still constitutes another important risk. Short-
term ample liquidity driven by countercyclical policies on a global scale exposes not only the 
emerging market currencies, but also commodity prices to speculative actions. Therefore, oil 
and other commodity price developments warrant caution, even in a scenario of a gradual 
global  economic  recovery.  Currently,  weak  domestic  demand  conditions  limit  the  pass-
through  stemming  from  upside  cost-push  shocks.  Therefore,  the  CBRT  will  accommodate 
volatility in commodity prices, especially in the short-term when domestic resource utilization 
remains at depressed levels. However, if an uptrend in commodity prices reflects a strong 
and durable rebound in global activity that may, in turn, create inflationary pressures, then

monetary  policy  will  react  accordingly  to  keep  inflation  in  line  with  medium  term  inflation 
targets. 
Distinguished members of the press, 
The CBRT has been taking the necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of global 
financial turmoil on the domestic economy. However, prudent monetary policy is necessary 
but not sufficient to maintain the resilience of the economy against the global crisis. Stronger 
commitment to fiscal discipline, alongside the structural reform agenda in the medium-term, 
is  also  critical  to  facilitate  expectations  management  and  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of 
monetary policy decisions. In this respect, utmost importance is attached to commitment to 
the harmonization with and convergence to policies of the European Union, as well as timely 
implementation  of  structural  reforms.  I  would  like  to  underline  that  we  will  be  closely 
monitoring  developments  pertaining  to  public  finance  while  determining  our  medium-term 
monetary policy strategies. Thank you very much for your attention.
