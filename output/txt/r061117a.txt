Jean-Pierre Roth: International monetary order – or disorder? 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Swiss 
National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the 
Research Institute for Empirical Economics and Economic Policy, University of St Gallen, St Gallen, 
14 November 2006. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 The term 'international monetary order' is misleading. Although international monetary systems may 
have appeared orderly in the past, they were actually dependent upon rigid compliance on the part of 
the industrial countries, first with respect to the gold standard and later with respect to fixed exchange 
rates.  However,  since  compliance  was  in  fact  anything  but  rigid,  the  world  experienced  a  series  of 
currency crises and devaluations. Order existed on paper only. The reality was disorder. Nowadays 
we have an overwhelming impression of disorder, and yet our national monetary systems are based 
on  sounder  foundations  than  in  the  past.  The  risk  of  currency  crises  has  been  lessened  by  the 
transition  to  flexible  exchange  rates  and  the  move  towards  monetary  integration.  In  addition,  the 
expansion  in  the  free  movement  of  capital  is  –  to  an  ever  increasing  extent  –  subjecting  national 
economies to the discipline of international competition. Inevitably, this has impacted on the role of the 
International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF).  While  the  IMF  used  to  be  the  guardian  of  the  system  of  fixed 
exchange rates established in Bretton Woods in 1944, it now works to promote international financial 
stability. In this role, it oversees the overall economic and financial position of its member countries. 
More than ever before, its activities are primarily aimed at crisis prevention.
