I thank ICRIER and InWEnt for giving me this opportunity to speak with you this morning. In 
my talk, I will try to address the following set of questions: How and why was India impacted 
by the global financial crisis? How did monetary policy respond to the crisis? What was the 
impact of the policy on the Reserve Bank’s balance sheet? How did monetary transmission 
work? I will conclude by highlighting the challenges of exit from monetary easing.  
2. 
The  subprime  crisis  that  emerged  in  the  US  housing  mortgage  market  in  2007 
snowballed  into  a  global  financial  crisis,  and  a  global  economic  recession  followed.  The 
financial  landscape  has  changed  significantly  after  the  collapse  of  Lehman  Brothers  in 
September  2008.  An  important  lesson,  post-September  2008,  is  that  irrespective  of  the 
degree of globalisation of a country and the soundness of its domestic policies, a financial 
crisis could spread to every economy.  
3. 
The international transmission of liquidity shocks was fast and unprecedented. While 
falling asset prices and uncertainty about valuation of the traded instruments affected market 
liquidity, failure of leading global financial institutions and the deleveraging process tightened 
the market for funding liquidity. Given the growing risk of illiquidity cascading into solvency 
problems,  credit  and  quantitative  easing  acquired  priority  in  most  central  banks.  While  the 
global  financial  markets  have  since  started  showing  signs  of  stabilisation,  credit  flow  in 
advanced markets is yet to recover. The contagion from the global financial crisis warranted 
swift  monetary  and  fiscal  policy  responses  with  a  view  to  ensuring  orderly  functioning  of 
markets, preserving financial stability, and moderating its adverse effects on growth.  
How was India impacted by the global financial crisis? 
Transmission of shocks to India  
4. 
There were two distinct phases in 2008–09 during which the transmission of global 
shocks – through trade, finance and expectations channels – posed different but significant 
challenges  for  the  Reserve  Bank.  In  the  first  half  of  the  year,  the  world  experienced 
simultaneous increase in both food and commodity prices, and there was a return of inflation 
after  a  phase  of  “great  moderation”.  Dealing  with  supply  side  sources  of  inflation  posed 
challenges  for  the  conduct  of  Reserve  Bank’s  monetary  policy,  particularly  in  the  face  of 
signs of cyclical slowdown on the one hand and the risk of spiralling headline inflation on the 
other.  In  the  second  half  of  the  year,  the  global  financial  crisis  and  the  subsequent  global 
recession dramatically changed the nature of the challenge emanating from globalisation.  
Impact on the financial markets 
5. 
Post-Lehman, the impact of the global financial crisis unfolded in the Indian financial 
markets,  though  reversal  of  capital  inflows  and  significant correction  in  the  domestic  stock 
markets on the back of sell-off in the equity market by the foreign institutional investors (FIIs). 
The  withdrawal  of  funds  from  the  Indian  equity  markets  and  reduced  access  of  the  Indian 
entities  to  raise  funds  from  the  international  markets  put  significant  pressure  on  the  dollar 
BIS Review 165/2009

liquidity  in  the  domestic  foreign  exchange  market.  These  developments  created  adverse 
expectations on the balance of payments (BoP) outlook and led to depreciation pressures on 
the Indian rupee and increased volatility in the foreign exchange market.  
6. 
The  banking  sector  was  not  affected  as  it  had  hardly  any  direct  exposure  to 
subprime assets. Moreover, banks were well capitalised and inherently sound. The reduced 
foreign funding and the subdued domestic capital market, however, put pressure on some 
segments  of  the  financial  system,  such  as  non-bank  financial  companies  (NBFCs)  and 
mutual funds. Mutual funds were dependent on corporates for bulk funds. As liquidity needs 
of the corporates increased, redemption pressures on mutual funds rose. This translated into 
liquidity  problems  for  NBFCs  as  mutual  funds  were  important  supplier  of  funds  to  NBFCs. 
Further, the demand for bank credit also increased as external sources of credit dried up for 
corporates. Against this background of increase in demand for liquidity, the  Reserve Bank 
had to step in with liquidity augmenting measures such as cuts in cash reserve ratio (CRR) 
and increase in refinance facilities. Consequently, the pressure for funding liquidity came to 
rest on the banks. In this scenario, the banks continued to expand credit and meet the funds 
requirements of mutual funds and NBFCs aided by liquidity easing measures by the Reserve 
Bank.  Initially,  though  bank  credit  could  not  fully  offset  the  shortfall  in  credit  from  other 
sources. Subsequently, demand for bank credit came down as the contagion transmitted to 
the real economy and eroded private consumption and investment demand.  
Impact on the real economy 
7. 
Under  the  impact  of  external  demand  shocks,  the  Indian  economy  witnessed 
moderation  in  growth  in  the  second  half  of  2008–09  in  comparison  with  the  robust  growth 
performance in the preceding five years (8.8 per cent per annum). The deceleration in growth 
was particularly noticeable in negative growth in industrial output in Q4 of 2008–09; a decline 
for the first time since the mid-1990s (Table 1). This was on account of erosion of external 
demand which affected industrial performance; a reflection of increasing globalisation of the 
Indian industry. 
8. 
The  transmission  of  external  demand  shocks  was  swift  and  severe  on  export 
growth, which declined from a peak of about 40 per cent in Q2 of 2008–09 to (–) 15 per cent 
in  Q3  and  further  to  (–)  22  per  cent  in  Q4;  a  contraction  for  the  first  time  since  2001–02. 
Concurrently, domestic aggregate demand also moderated resulting from sharp deceleration 
in the growth of private consumption demand. In order to respond to the slowing demand, 
fiscal stimulus measures were undertaken by the government which included both tax cuts 
and  increase  in  expenditure.  This  raised  the  fiscal  deficit  of  the  Central  Government  by 
3.5 per cent of GDP in 2008–09. Consequently, the growth in government final consumption 
expenditure registered a sharp increase in Q3 and Q4 of 2008–09 (Table 2). It is, however, 
important to note that unlike many countries the entire fiscal stimulus in India was aimed at 
addressing the deficiency in aggregate demand rather than extending support to the financial 
sector. While this meant a deviation from the planned fiscal consolidation path as committed 
under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, without the stimulus 
the deceleration in GDP growth during 2008–09 would have been much sharper.

Why was India impacted by the global financial crisis? 
9. 
During the initial phases of the global crisis, the Indian financial markets remained 
unaffected  as  the  direct  exposure  of  banks  to  global  subprime  assets  was  negligible.  The 
growth process being largely domestic demand driven remained broadly intact. It was then 
perceived  that  India  and  other  EMEs  were  “decoupled”  from  the  advanced  economies.  As 
indicated by Governor Dr. Subbarao “the ‘decoupling theory’ was never totally persuasive”.1 
As  the  crisis  intensified,  particularly  after  the  Lehman  collapse,  the  global  shocks  first 
impacted the domestic financial markets and then transmitted to the real economy through 
the trade and finance and confidence channels.  
10. 
Despite  the  dominance  of  domestic  demand,  the  role  of  trade  in  conditioning  the 
growth  process  in  India  is  becoming  important  over  time.  A  significant  boost  to  global 
integration came through rapid growth in India’s international trade in services in the 2000s 
enabled  by  expansion  in  information  technology  which  facilitated  cross-border  delivery  of 
services.  Progressive  liberalisation  of  capital  account  initiated  in  the  1990s  and  continued 
through the 2000s gave further fillip to the process of financial integration. Thus the financial 
channel emerged as dominant factor with gross capital flows (inflows plus outflows) rising to 
over  50  per  cent  of  GDP  in  2008–09  from  an  average  of  about  5  per  cent  in  the  1980s 
(Table 3). Given the significant degree of openness achieved since the 1990s, it is natural 
that the global shocks – real as well as financial – have greater impact.

With  increased  global  integration,  the  Indian  economy  now  is  subject  to  greater 
influence of global business cycles. The correlation between the cyclical component of the 
index of industrial product (IIP) of the advanced economies and India has risen to 0.50 during 
the period 1991–2009 from 0.20 in during the period 1971–1990 (Chart 1).

The traditional conduit of transmission of global shocks is trade cycles. The cyclical 
movement  in  India’s  exports  and  world  imports  during  the  earlier  period  1970–91  was  not 
significantly  synchronised  with  a  relatively  low  correlation  of  0.38.  However,  with  rising 
exports  along  with  a  transition  from  primary  article  exports  to  manufacturing  exports,  the 
correlation  between  India’s  exports  and  world  imports  has  increased  significantly  to  0.80 
during the recent period 1992–2009 (Chart 2).

Besides the synchronisation of the trade cycles, the financial channel of integration 
has also become prominent during the recent period. A causal analysis between the cyclical 
component  of  the  Indian  stock  prices  (BSE  Sensex)  and  the  US  stock  prices  (S&P  500 
Index) reveals that during the earlier period (1970–1991), when foreign investors could not 
participate in the Indian stock market, there was no causal effect of the global stock prices on 
the  Indian  markets.  However,  in  the  recent  period  (1992–2009),  there  has  been  greater 
impact from the global stock prices on domestic stock prices with the US stock prices having 
significant causal impact on the Indian stock prices (Table 4).

These  shifts  in  the  degree  of  synchronisation  of  the  Indian  trade  and  business 
cycles with the global cycles and increased financial integration in the recent period indicate 
that India cannot remain immune to global trends. Thus, global economic developments now 
have a greater influence on the domestic economy.  
 There  are,  however,  some  key  differences  between  the  actions  taken  by  the 
How did monetary policy in India respond to the global financial crisis? 
15. 
As the crisis intensified, the Reserve Bank, like most central banks, took a number 
of  conventional  and  unconventional  measures  to  augment  domestic  and  foreign  exchange 
liquidity, and sharply reduced the policy rates. In a span of seven months between October 
2008 and April 2009, there was unprecedented policy activism. For example: (i) the repo rate 
was reduced by 425 basis points to 4.75 per cent, (ii) the reverse repo rate was reduced by 
275  basis  points  to  3.25,  (iii)  the  cash  reserve  ratio  (CRR)  was  reduced  by  a  cumulative 
400 basis points to 5.0 per cent, and (iv) the actual/potential provision of primary liquidity was 
of the order of Rs. 5.6 trillion (10.5 per cent of GDP). 
16. 
Reserve Bank of India and the central banks in many advanced countries: 
• 
First,  in  the  process  of  liquidity  injection  the  counter-parties  were  banks;  even 
liquidity  measures  for mutual  funds,  NBFCs  and  housing finance  companies  were 
largely channeled through the banks.  
Second, there was no dilution of collateral standards which were largely government 
securities, unlike the mortgage securities and commercial papers in the advanced 
economies.  
Third,  despite  large  liquidity  injection  the  Reserve  Bank’s  balance  sheet  did  not 
show unusual increase because of release of earlier sterilised liquidity.  
Fourth,  availability  and  deployment  of  multiple  instruments  facilitated  better 
sequencing of monetary and liquidity measures. 
Finally,  the  experience  in  the  use  of  procyclical  provisioning  norms  and  counter-
cyclical regulations ahead of the global crisis helped enhance financial stability.  
17. 
By synchronising the liquidity management operations with those of exchange rate 
management  and  non-disruptive  internal  debt  management  operations,  the  Reserve  Bank 
ensured that appropriate liquidity was maintained in the system, consistent with the objective 
of  price  and  financial  stability.  The  policy  stance  clearly  reflected  the  forward  looking 
undertone, particularly the expectations of more prolonged adverse external conditions in the 
face of no visible risks to inflation. While the magnitude of the crisis was global in nature, the 
policy  responses  were  adapted  to  domestic  growth,  inflationary  and  financial  sector 
conditions.  
   6 
 BIS Review 165/2009
How did crisis management change the reserve bank’s balance sheet? 
18. 
As the balance of payments came under pressure in Q3 of 2008–09 due to capital 
outflows, it became necessary to draw down reserves to finance the shortfall and maintain 
orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market. This led to corresponding contraction in 
the base (reserve) money. The Reserve Bank, therefore, ensured the necessary expansion 
in net domestic assets (NDA) through conventional open market operations (OMO) involving 
outright purchase of government securities in the secondary market as well as provision of 
liquidity through repos under in its daily liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) (Chart 3). Another 
instrument  which  allowed  the  Reserve  Bank  to  expand  liquidity  was  the  unwinding  of  the 
market  stabilisation  scheme  (MSS)  securities.2  The  unwinding  of  MSS  balances  not  only 
created the scope for adequate liquidity expansion by the Reserve Bank without expanding 
its balance sheet (Chart 4) in any significant measure, but the timing of the unwinding could 
also be modulated in such a way that the large borrowing programme of the government was 
managed smoothly without exerting undue market stress. In addition, the reduction in CRR of 
banks from 9 per cent to 5 per cent released Rs.1.6 trillion of primary liquidity to the banking 
system.

While  the  Reserve  Bank’s  balance  sheet  did  not  show  unusual  expansion,  sharp 
reductions in CRR raised the money multiplier, leading to higher increase in broad money.3 
The average money multiplier rose from 4.3 in March 2008 to 4.8 in March 2009, reflecting 
lowering  of  CRR  (Chart  5).  The  increase  in  money  multiplier  ensured  steady  increase  in 
money supply consistent with the liquidity requirements of the economy. 
 
                                                 
2   MSS securities are essentially short-term government securities, introduced in April 2004, as an instrument of 
sterilisation  to  partly  neutralise  the  expansionary  effects  of  surges  in  capital  inflows.  The  amount  sterilised 
through MSS remained immobilised in the Central Government’s account with the Reserve Bank of India. As 
at end-September 2008, MSS amount stood over Rs. 1.7 trillion. 
3   Money Multiplier can be expressed as [1+c]/(c+r], where, c is currency-deposit ratio (a behavioural variable) 
and  r  is  reserve  requirement  ratio  (a  policy  variable).  A  reduction  in  r  leads  to  an  increase  in  the  money 
multiplier.

The  liquidity  injection  efforts  of  the  Reserve  Bank,  despite  being  large,  could  be 
achieved without compromising either on the eligible counterparties or on the asset quality in 
the Reserve Bank’s balance sheet. The liquidity requirements of non-bank financial entities 
were  met  indirectly  by  extending  liquidity  support  to  the  designated  counterparties  like 
scheduled  commercial  banks  and  primary  dealers.  Liquidity  expansion  achieved  through 
unwinding  of  MSS  and  reduction  in  reserve  requirement  ensured  that  the  Reserve  Bank’s 
balance sheet did not expand significantly, unlike in several other central banks. 
How did monetary transmission work?  
In the wake of the crisis, monetary transmission broke down in several countries as 
21. 
risk aversion gave rise to credit crunch. As regards India, the changes in the Reserve Bank’s 
policy rates were quickly transmitted to the money and debt markets (Chart 6). The money 
market rates moved in tandem with the policy reverse repo rate. However, transmission to 
the credit market was slow due to several structural rigidities in the system, especially the 
dominance of fixed term deposit liabilities in banks’ balance sheets at fixed interest rates.

 What are the challenges of exit from monetary easing? 
23. 
There is an active debate on the timing and sequencing of expansionary monetary 
stance around the world. In this context, Governor Dr. Subbarao, in his J.R.D. Tata Memorial 
Lecture had indicated that the current monetary and fiscal stance is not the steady state. The 
exit  from  the  current  monetary  policy  accommodation  could,  however,  be  different  across 
countries  depending  on  the  balance  of  risk  to  growth  and  price  stability,  type  of  balance

sheet adjustment that have taken place during the crisis and the position of the economy in 
the business cycle. In the case of advanced countries, where central bank balance sheets 
have  expanded  substantially  including  the  portfolio  comprising  of  mortgage  backed 
securities, commercial papers and corporate bonds, the exit policies may be constrained by 
the  speed  of  revival  and  developments  in  the  specific  market  segments.  In  contrast,  the 
central  bank  accommodation  in  India  was  mainly  done  through  unwinding  of  MMS  and 
conduct  of  OMO  including  LAF  and  through  special  refinancing  facilities  in  the  banking 
system. Thus, the withdrawal of monetary accommodation in India should be feasible without 
adverse impact on specific market segments.

the challenges. To quote:  
The October 2009 Review of Monetary Policy for the Year 2009–10 brought forward 
“The precise challenge for the Reserve Bank is to support the recovery process 
without compromising on price stability. This calls for a careful management of 
trade-offs. Growth drivers warrant a delayed exit, while inflation concerns call for 
an early exit. Premature exit will derail the fragile growth, but a delayed exit can 
potentially  engender  inflation  expectations….  The  balance  of  judgment  at  the 
current juncture is that it may be appropriate to sequence the “exit” in a calibrated 
way  so  that  while  the  recovery  process  is  not  hampered,  inflation  expectations 
remain anchored. The “exit” process can begin with the closure of some special 
liquidity support measures.”  
Accordingly, the Reserve Bank has begun the first phase of “exit”, by withdrawal of most of 
the unconventional measure taken during the crisis.

Conclusion 
25. 
To  sum  up,  despite sound  fundamentals  and no  direct  exposure  to  the  sub-prime 
assets, India was affected by global financial crisis reflecting increasing globalisation of the 
Indian  economy.  The  policy  response  has  been  swift.  While  fiscal  stimulus  cushioned  the 
deficiency  in  demand,  monetary  policy  augmented  both  domestic  and  foreign  exchange 
liquidity. The expansionary policy stance of the Reserve Bank was manifested in significant 
reduction in CRR as well as the policy rates. The contraction of the Reserve Bank’s balance

management  aimed  at  expanding  domestic  assets,  which  was  ensured  through  OMO 
including regular operations under the LAF, unwinding of MSS securities, introduction of new 
and scaling up of existing refinance facilities. In addition, sharp reductions in CRR besides 
making available primary liquidity raised the money multiplier and ensured steady increase in 
money supply. The liquidity injection efforts of the Reserve Bank could be achieved without 
compromising  either  on  the  eligible  counterparties  or  on  the  asset  quality  in  the  Reserve 
Bank’s balance sheet. Moreover, the Reserve Bank’s balance sheet did not show unusual 
increase, unlike that of several other central banks.  
26. 
At present, the focus around the world and also in India has shifted from managing 
the crisis to managing the recovery. The key challenge relates to the exit strategy that needs 
to be designed considering that the recovery is as yet fragile but there is an uptick in inflation, 
though largely from the supply side, which could engender inflationary expectations. Thus, 
the Reserve Bank has initiated the first phase of exit in its October 2009 Review of monetary 
policy in a calibrated manner mainly by withdrawal of unconventional measures taken during 
the  crisis.  This  should  help  anchor  inflationary  expectations  by  reducing  the  overhang  of 
liquidity without jeopardising the growth process as market liquidity remains comfortable.  
Thank you.
