Bojan Marković: Recent economic and financial developments in Serbia 
Speech  by  Mr  Bojan  Marković,  Vice  Governor  of  the  National  Bank  of  Serbia,  at  the 
presentation of the February Inflation Report, Belgrade, 13 February 2012. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed members of the press and fellow economists, 
Inflation  continued  to  fall  and  settled  at  7.0%  in  December  2011.  Consistent  with  our 
projections from last year’s Inflation Reports, inflation will return within the target tolerance 
band already in this quarter. Gross domestic product growth picked up mildly in the fourth 
quarter of 2011, but is likely to slow down in the current year to around 0.5%, mainly due to 
the prospect of recession in the euro area. In response to subsiding medium-term inflationary 
pressures, the National Bank of Serbia has cut the key policy rate over the last nine months 
by a total of 300 basis points, to the current level of 9.5%. The future path of the key policy 
rate  will  depend  on  inflation  factors,  and  in  particular  on  the  risks  stemming  from  the 
international environment and the fiscal policy stance at home.

Today we will present in more detail our view of past macroeconomic developments and our 
expectations for the period ahead.  
 Public  debt  crisis  in  some  euro  area  members  is  showing  signs  of  abating.  Still,  in 
anticipation of a systemic solution that would reassure investors and prevent the contagion, 
volatility in the financial markets persists, threatening to stall the recovery of the euro area 
economy and to slow growth at global level.  
In such an environment, international prices of most primary commodities continued to fall, 
moderately,  with  the  exceptions  of  oil  and  other  energy  products,  which  edged  up  in  the 
fourth quarter amid political tensions in the Persian Gulf. 
Economic activity indicators point to a fall in the euro area’s GDP in the fourth quarter, and 
based on the latest forecasts, that tendency is likely to persist in 2012. Growth forecasts for 
countries in the region, which are Serbia’s important trade partners, have also been revised 
down.   
These developments triggered a further rise in Serbia’s risk premium in the last quarter of 
2011.  And  though  the  risk  premium,  measured  by  the  Emerging  Markets  Bond  Index, 
receded  mildly  since  the  beginning  of  the  year,  it  is  currently  by  around  160  basis  points 
higher than in mid-2011. As a result, at the end of January the dinar was around 5% weaker 
vis-à-vis the euro than at the end of the third quarter of 2011. However, compared to regional 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 1
peers under a similar exchange rate regime, the dinar exchange rate was more stable during 
the  last  year,  indicating  that  Serbia’s  financial  resilience  to  external  shocks  is  somewhat 
greater than in earlier years.   
A recent increase in the foreign exchange market volatility was not accompanied by the drop 
in liquidity. To the contrary, over the last few days trading volumes at the interbank foreign 
exchange market averaged around EUR 130 million per day, which shows that the foreign 
exchange market is operating smoothly.  
The  National  Bank  of  Serbia  remains  committed  to  intervening  in  the  foreign  exchange 
market in the event of excessive daily volatility and low trading volumes. Any central bank 
intervention to defend the level of the exchange rate would render foreign exchange cheaper 
for those with poor foreign exchange liquidity management, as well as short-term investors 
leaving the country, and all of this at the expense of Serbia’s foreign exchange reserves. This 
would encourage risky short-term investors and reduce the inherent stability of the Serbian 
financial market, which is contrary to the objectives of the National Bank and a disincentive 
for long-term investors.  
Nevertheless, let me reiterate that the National Bank will do everything necessary to prevent 
any excessive short-term fluctuations and to ensure stability of the Serbian foreign exchange 
market.  Foreign  exchange  reserves  in  the  amount  of  EUR  11.6  billion  are  more  than  a 
sufficient guarantee of our capacity to do so.

Keeping the fiscal budget for 2012 within the framework agreed earlier with the International 
Monetary Fund would help strengthen the country’s financial and macroeconomic stability. It 
would provide an additional assurance to foreign investors that the Serbian authorities are 
running  a  responsible  and  sustainable  macroeconomic  policy,  which  would  lead  to  lower 
country risk premium and bring the costs of borrowing down. 
 Unfavourable  movements  in  the  international  environment  have  already  reflected  on  the 
Serbian economy in the last three quarters, though a modest pick-up was registered by the 
end  of  the  last  year.  Serbia’s  GDP  is  estimated  to  have  increased  in  the  fourth  quarter  of 
2011 by 0.8% relative to the same period a year earlier, and by 0.3% relative to the quarter 
before.

The  most  significant  contribution  came  from  investment  activity,  which  is  reflected  in  the 
robust  growth  in  imports  of  equipment  in  the  fourth  quarter.  Consistent  with  retail  trade 
movements,  final  consumption  rose  modestly,  remaining  subdued  compared  to  previous 
years.  This  is  due  primarily  to  the  rise  in  unemployment  over  the  past  three  years,  which, 
according to the results of the last Labour Force Survey, stood at 23.7% in November 2011.

Foreign trade expanded in late 2011, though with imports outpacing exports. Encouraging, 
however,  is  that  imports  of  equipment  and  intermediate  goods  grew  faster  than  imports  of 
consumer  goods.  Robust  growth  in  imports  of  equipment  and  intermediate  goods  in  the 
fourth  quarter  was  the main  reason  for  the  higher  than  expected  current  account  deficit  in 
2011,  which  came  at  9.1%  of  GDP.  On  the  side  of  exports,  growth  was  driven  mainly  by 
processed  food  and  chemical  products,  while  exports  of  agricultural  products  were  on  the 
decline in the fourth quarter, due primarily to low river levels, river flows being a major route 
for the agricultural products exports.

Private investment was the key driver of the 1.9% GDP growth in 2011. At the same time, 
personal consumption declined, and net exports gave a neutral contribution.

The  deteriorated  growth  outlook  of  our  key  foreign  trade  partners  and  Smederevo  Steel 
Factory  (ex  US  Steel)  losing  its  private  owner  were  the  key  reasons  behind  the  National 
Bank of Serbia’s downward revision of the GDP growth forecast for 2012 to 0.5% from 1.5%. 
As  a  reminder,  the  GDP  growth  projection  in  the  November  Inflation  Report  assumed 
economic stagnation in the euro area in 2012, but implied higher downside risks due to the 
assessment  of  a  significant  probability  of  the  euro  area’s  slipping  into  recession. The  new 
GDP growth projection assumes a recession, i.e. a 0.5% fall in economic activity of the euro 
area, but this time, the risks to the projection are evenly balanced.  
Developments in the international environment will weigh primarily on demand for our export 
products and the inflow of foreign direct investments.  
Despite  the  expected  contraction  in  export  demand,  some  of  the  investments  made  and 
those  underway  in  export-oriented  industries,  primarily  automotive,  will  begin  to  reflect  on 
output and export figures in this and the following year. However, the departure of the private 
owner of Smederevo Steel Factory signals muted prospects for the exports of base metals. 
The  economy  as  a  whole  is  likely  to  see  a  modest  increase  in  exports  this  year,  while 
stronger growth may be expected only with the recovery of external demand. 
Given  the  high  unemployment  rate  and  modest  economic  growth  forecast,  we  expect  that 
final consumption will fall this year again. This, together with lower investment demand, will 
reflect in a drop in imports.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
A  more  visible  recovery  of  Serbian  economy  may  be  expected  only  in  2013,  conditioned 
largely on how the global growth dynamics plays out.  
We wish to underline again that sustainability of economic growth in Serbia is more important 
than  its  pace,  which  assumes  further  shifting  of  the  sources  of  growth  from  domestic  final 
consumption towards net exports and investments, primarily into export-oriented industries. 
 A  downward  trend  in  year-on-year  inflation,  in  place  since  last  May,  continued,  driven 
primarily  by  the  weakening  of  the  cost-push  pressure  of  food  prices  and  low  aggregate 
demand.  Monetary  policy  mitigated  successfully  the  increase  in  inflation  expectations,  and 
thus the spill-over from food price growth to other prices by lifting the key policy rate in late 
2010 and early 2011.

The fourth quarter saw consumer prices rising 0.6%, while their year-on-year growth eased 
down from 9.3% in September to 7.0% in December. 
The key contribution to the decline in inflation in that quarter came from food prices again. 
Growth in fruit and vegetable prices fell short of what would be a typical hike for that time of 
the year, while processed food prices declined through cheapening of their inputs, such as 
wheat and corn.    
Market-determined  prices  of  non-food  products  and  services  also  grew  more  moderately 
than  in  the  third  quarter.  This  component  of  the  Consumer  Price  Index,  which  is  most 
persistent and most responsive to monetary policy measures, has moved within the target 
tolerance band practically ever since the inflation targeting regime in Serbia was introduced. 
As far as administered prices are concerned, the only significant hikes in the fourth quarter 
were  recorded  for  natural  gas  and  heating,  but  their  contribution  to  headline  inflation  was 
modest. Nevertheless, due to the high growth in the first half of the year, administered prices 
exceeded the growth framework planned for 2011. 
Year-on-year inflation is expected to continue down, i.e. to return within the target tolerance 
band already in this quarter, which confirms our projections from last year’s Inflation Reports. 
Medium-term,  it  is  expected  to  remain  within  the  target  tolerance  band,  with  occasional 
oscillations. 
The  Government’s  decree  imposing  a  10%  restriction  on  trade  margins  on  some  food 
products led to their cheapening in January, but as the decree expires in July, these prices 
could  bounce  back.  However,  provided  that  primary  agricultural  commodities  see  no 
considerable hikes in the coming period, the prices of processed food will probably rise at a 
somewhat slower rate than those of non-food products.

On the other hand, fruit and vegetable prices will probably outpace other prices in 2012. In 
view of their sharp fall in the season behind us, fruit and vegetable prices are estimated to be 
rather low currently, and are hence likely to rise even in the event of an average agricultural 
performance. We expect the contribution of fruit and vegetable prices to inflation growth to be 
most pronounced in the second quarter, with the onset of a new agricultural season. 
Looking forward, growth in administered prices is likely to be slower than in earlier years as 
they  have  come  closer  to  an  economically  sustainable  level.  Their  growth  in  2012  will 
probably be modest until the formation of new republic and local authorities, but could catch 
up thereafter, in the second half of the year.  
A  rise  in  import  prices,  prompted  by  the  weakening  of  the  dinar,  may  put  pressure  on 
domestic  prices.  We  estimate,  however,  that  real  marginal  costs  of  net  importers  are  still 
relatively low, and that importers will be able to offset a major part of the growth in import 
costs by cutting their margins.  
Given  the  high  unemployment  rate  and  deteriorated  outlook  for  economic  growth  at  home 
and abroad, the disinflationary pressures stemming from low aggregate demand will persist 
over the coming period as well.  
A disinflationary effect will also be generated by inflation expectations. In the fourth quarter, 
they  dropped  to  6.0%  from  8.0%.  In  light  of  a further  decline  in  inflationary  pressures,  the 
downward tendency in inflation expectations is likely to continue this year.

A decline in year-on-year inflation will be pronounced in the first months of 2012 as high price 
hikes from early 2011 drop out of its calculation. As a result, inflation will return within the 
target  tolerance  band  already  in  this  quarter.  Year-on-year  inflation  will  reach  its  minimum 
level in March or April, when it should move around the lower bound of the target tolerance 
band. However, with the onset of a new agricultural season, higher growth in administered 
prices after elections, and the repeal of the decree limiting trade margins, inflation will return 
towards the target by the third quarter 2012. On account of these factors, in the first half of 
2013 year-on-year inflation may temporarily stand at around the upper bound of the target 
tolerance band, only to return towards the 4±1.5% target thereafter.  
The key risks to the presented projection relate mostly to the international environment and 
fiscal policy at home. 
Outlook  for  Serbia’s  economic  growth  and  pressures  on  inflation  will  largely  depend  on 
developments in the euro area given that its members, together with countries in our region, 
are our major foreign trade partners. The speed and way of resolving the public debt crisis in 
some member states, as well economic activity in the euro area may, in addition to demand 
for our export products, also impact the country risk premium movements. Under the latest 
6 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches
indicators, the economic downturn in the euro area in 2012 may be softer than the assumed 
0.5%, though deviations are possible in both directions. 
Fiscal policy will also have a significant impact on the perception of country risk. Mounting 
public debt and a more significant deviation of the 2012 budget from the framework agreed 
earlier  with  the  IMF  may  have  inflationary  consequences  through  rising  risk  premium, 
depreciation  pressures  and  higher  demand,  which  would  leave  less  scope  for  monetary 
policy easing.  
 In response to subsiding inflationary pressures, the National Bank of Serbia has cut the key 
policy rate over the last nine months by total 300 basis points to its current level of 9.5%. In 
February, the key policy rate was left unchanged. The future path of the key policy rate will 
depend  on  materialisation  of  inflation  factors,  while  developments  in  the  international 
environment and fiscal policy at home remain the key risks. 
We  wish  to  remind  that  the  decline  in  inflation  to  around  the  lower  bound  of  the  target 
tolerance band, which may happen in some months of the first half of the year, would be only 
temporary and, as such, would not be the reason for monetary policy response. Given the 
time lag in reaction of the key policy rate on inflation, monetary policy should not respond to 
temporary factors, but to factors with a medium-term effect on inflation.

 Ladies and gentlemen, recent developments in some countries in the region show that in the 
current  situation  financial  markets  are  highly  sensitive  to  any  disruption  in  macroeconomic 
and financial stability.  
Therefore,  the  best  way  for  the  Government  and  the  central  bank  to  contribute  to  the 
improvement  in  the  economic  environment  is  to  pursue  a  policy  which  ensures  long-term 
macroeconomic stability. Such policy implies a sustainable level of public debt, price stability 
over  the  medium  term,  and  a  stable  and  resilient  financial  system.  Any  attempt  at 
“stimulating” the economy in an unsustainable way could jeopardise the achievement of the 
above objectives, which would elevate the country risk and increase the costs of borrowing, 
exacerbate the business environment, and ultimately, inflict damage to the economy it was 
intended to help.  
The National Bank of Serbia will therefore continue to stabilise inflation at a low level and 
maintain a sound financial system which, in our opinion, is the best way to help the economy 
in the given circumstances. The more the fiscal budget developments are aligned with the 
framework earlier agreed with the IMF, the more attainable will be the achievement of these 
objectives, with more stimulative monetary policy.
