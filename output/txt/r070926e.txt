Philipp Hildebrand: (The) productivity (imperative) 
Summary of a speech by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of 
the Swiss National Bank, at Avenir suisse, Zurich, 24 September 2007. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bankâ€™s website (www.snb.ch). 
 Just a few years ago, the weak growth of the Swiss economy was a dominant topic in public 
debate.  For  four  years  now,  the  economy  has  been  advancing  strongly.  Is  this  merely  a 
cyclical  boom?  Or  has  structural  change  taken  place,  affecting  both  productivity  and  the 
associated  potential  growth  path?  This  would  have  far-reaching  implications,  not  least  for 
monetary policy. 
A number of factors indicate that structural change is indeed occurring and that this could 
ultimately result in an increase in the underlying productivity trend. However, time lags and 
cyclical distortions make it difficult to identify such changes.
