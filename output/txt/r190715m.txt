 Development of Viable Capital Markets –– The Indian Experience 
by Dr. Viral V. Acharya, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India (RBI)1 
 1.  Introduction 
 1.1  Capital  markets  play  a  crucial  role  in  the  economic  development  of  a  country. 
They provide financial resources required for the long-term sustainable development 
of the economy. Development of viable capital markets is therefore considered an 
important element in the macro-financial policy toolkit, including for objectives such 
as financial stability and the transmission of monetary policy. 
1.2 The Committee on Global Financial System (CGFS), which meets at the Bank for 
International Settlements (BIS), constituted a Working Group in 2018-19 to examine 
global  trends  in  capital  market  development,  identify  various  factors  (legal, 
institutional, structural and conjunctural) that foster the development of robust capital 
markets, and consider the role of policy including prudential measures. The Working 
Group, co-chaired by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC, Dr. Li Bo) and the Reserve 
Bank of India (RBI, Dr. Viral V. Acharya), focussed on issues primarily related to the 
development  of  markets  in  bond  and  equity  securities2.  While  these  issues  are 
arguably of greater relevance to emerging market economies, they were found to be 
of significant interest even for advanced economies.   
1.3  The  CGFS  Report  identified  the  drivers  of  capital  market  development  and 
categorised them into two types:  
(i) drivers which create an enabling environment for financial development, and  
(ii) drivers which are more capital market specific.  
                                                            
1  These  remarks  collectively  summarise  the  presentations  made  earlier  at  the  RBI  symposium  on 
Establishing Viable Capital Markets, 29 May 2019; the Institute for Indian Economic Studies (IIES), 
Tokyo,  Japan,  10  June  2019;  the  meeting  with  Foreign  Portfolio  Investors,  Tokyo,  Japan,  11  June 
2019;  the  National  University  of  Singapore  (NUS)  Asian  Leaders  in  Financial  Institutions  (ALFI) 
Programme,  Bengaluru,  20  June  2019,  and  Fireside  Chat  at  the  Indian  School  of  Business, 
Hyderabad, 29 June 2019.

  1.4 Drivers which create an enabling environment as identified in the CGFS Report 
include:  
–  macroeconomic stability,  
–  broad respect for market autonomy,  
–  fair and efficient legal and judicial systems, and  
–  an  efficient  regulatory  regime  that  creates  conditions  favourable  for 
financial contracts.  
1.5  Drivers  which  are  capital  market  specific  as  identified  in  the  CGFS  Report 
include: 
–  easy access to high-quality material information,  
–  diversity in the investor base,  
–  efficient market ecosystem for trading and robust market infrastructures, 
–  openness 
investors  while  maintaining  macro-
international 
towards 
economic stability, and 
–  markets for hedging and funding securities.  
1.6 The CGFS Report made six broad policy recommendations:  
(i) promoting greater market autonomy;  
(ii) strengthening legal and judicial systems for investor protection;  
(iii) enhancing regulatory independence and effectiveness;  
(iv)  increasing  the  depth  and  diversity  of  the  domestic  institutional  investor 
base;  
(v) opening up capital markets internationally in a bi-directional manner; and  
(vi)  developing  complementary  markets  for  derivatives,  repo  transactions 
and securities lending. 
 
1.7  Policy  initiatives  in  India  have  been  largely  in  sync  with  the  findings  and 
recommendations  of  the  CGFS  Report.  I  shall  discuss  these  and  future  policy 
directions  after  providing  a  brief  overview  of  the  Indian  capital  markets.  While  the 
scope  of  the  CGFS  Report  is  the  entire  capital  market,  I  will  largely  confine  this 
speech to the markets regulated by the Reserve Bank, viz., interest rate markets and 
(to a lesser extent) foreign exchange markets.

2. Overview of the Indian capital markets 
2.1  Indian  capital  markets  have  a  history  of  more  than  a  century.  However,  they 
remained largely inactive till the 1970s. Partial liberalisation of the economy and pro-
capital market policies during the 1980s infused some life into the markets, but it was 
only the economic liberalisation of the 1990s that provided a lasting impetus. Today, 
segments of India’s capital markets are comparable with counterparts in many of the 
advanced economies in terms of efficiency (price discovery), tradability (low impact 
cost),  resilience  (co-movement  of  rates  across  product  classes  and  yield  curves), 
and stability. In particular, their ability to withstand several periods of stress, notably 
the  Asian  financial  crisis  in  1997-98,  the  global  financial  crisis  in  2007-09  and  the 
“taper tantrum” episode in 2013, is a sign of their increasing maturity.  
2.2  In  terms  of  size,  all  the  major  segments  of  the  capital  market,  viz.,  Central 
Government securities (G-Sec) market, market for State Development Loans (SDL), 
corporate bond market and equity market –– the so called “cash markets” –– have 
experienced  consistent  growth  during  the  past  few  decades  in  terms  of  primary 
issuance,  market  capitalisation  (for  equity  market)  and  trading  volumes  in  the 
secondary market. Equity market remains the largest segment, even as G-Sec, SDL 
and corporate bond markets have grown steadily (Chart 1).

2.3 Growth of the Government Securities market: A streamlined, transparent and 
market-based  primary  issuance  process  has  underpinned  the  development  of  the 
government  securities  markets,  both  central  government  securities  (G-Secs)  and 
state  government  securities  (SDLs).  In  the  primary  G-Sec  markets,  issuances  are 
made  as  per  a  half-yearly  pre-announced  calendar.  The  calendar  specifies  the 
amount, tenor and issuance dates. The tenor of the G-Secs goes up to 40 years. G-
Secs  are  mostly  fixed-coupon  bonds,  although  instruments  such  as  inflation-linked 
bonds, capital-indexed bonds, floating-rate bonds and bonds with embedded options 
are  also  issued.  Currently,  all  issuances  are  done  through  weekly  auctions. 
Issuances are supported by Primary Dealers (PDs) who fully underwrite the issue. 
Auctions are conducted through both competitive bidding [for all residents, Foreign 
Portfolio  Investors  (FPIs)  and  Non-Resident  Indians  (NRIs)],  which  determines  the 
market-clearing  price,  and  non-competitive  bidding  (for  retail  investors,  largely), 
which receives the allotted securities at the market-clearing price. More than 90% of 
the  issuances  are  done  through  re-opening  of  existing  securities  which  has 
contributed significantly to market liquidity by spreading out ownership across a large 
number of investors. The Reserve Bank has also introduced “when-issued” segment 
for the G-Sec market since 20063.  
The  profile  of  both  G-Secs  and  SDLs  in  terms  of  stock  and  flow  characteristics  is 
shown in Tables 1 and 2. The weighted average coupon on G-Secs has remained 
stable across interest rate cycles imparting stability to the debt profile as the average 
maturity of issuance (more than 10 years) is one of the longest globally, helping limit 
the rollover risk for the central government. SDL issuance has increasingly formed a 
much greater share of issuance relative to the G-Secs, rising from around 25% of 
issuance in 2013-14 to around 45% in 2017-18. 
                                                              
3.  ‘When  Issued’,  a  short  form  of  'when,  as  and  if  issued  ',  indicates  a  conditional  transaction  in  a 
security authorized for issuance but not as yet actually issued. All 'when issued' transactions are on 
an  'if'  basis,  to  be  settled  if  and  when  the  actual  security  is  issued.  Such  trading  facilitates  the 
distribution  process  for  Government  securities  by  stretching  the  actual  distribution  period  for  each 
issue and allowing the market more time to absorb large issues without disruption.

2.4  Liquidity  of  the  G-Sec  market:  Liquidity  in  the  secondary  market  for 
government securities has noticeably improved over the past decade (Chart 2). The 
average daily volume in the G-Sec and SDL markets has remained higher than that 
 5 
  of  corporate  bond  and  equity  cash  markets.  The  liquidity  in  G-Secs  is,  however, 
mainly  concentrated  in  a  few  benchmark  securities,  particularly  the  10-year 
benchmark, and SDLs are relatively less liquid than the G-Secs, yielding typically 50-
75  basis  points  more  than  the  G-Secs  in  terms  of  yield  at  the  10-year  tenor.  The 
average bid-ask spread for liquid securities in the G-Sec market has remained less 
than a basis point during the last few years (Chart 3). Strikingly, bid-ask spread as 
well  as  the  price  impact  of  trade  for  the  10  year  Indian  G-Sec  benchmark  are 
comparable to or lower than those for most of the advanced economies of the world 
including the US, the UK, France and Germany (Chart 4).

There are several proximate drivers of this liquidity of the Indian G-Sec market:  
(i) Regular issuance of the 10-year benchmark has concentrated trading interest in 
this segment of the yield curve. Efforts are now being made to regularise issuance of 
benchmark securities at shorter maturities (2 and 5 years). 
(ii) Secondary market transactions are predominantly (around 80%) conducted in an 
anonymous  electronic  order  matching  system  (NDS-OM)  which  is  unique  in  the 
world  for  debt  trading.  While  the  remaining  transactions  happen  over-the-counter 
 6 
 
(OTC)  outside  the  NDS-OM4,  they  are  nevertheless  reported  to  the  NDS-OM 
platform.  
 (iii)  Near  real-time  dissemination  of  trade  information  publicly  accessible  on  the 
website of the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL) ensures price transparency.  
(iv) Settlement is guaranteed by the CCIL and takes place through Delivery versus 
Payment (DvP) mechanism on T+1 basis. Guaranteed settlement implies there is no 
risk to investors from each other of delivery failures. 
(v)  Finally,  enabling  of  short-selling  facilitates  a  two-way  interest  adding  to  activity 
and price discovery in the market.

2.5  Growth  and  liquidity  of  the  corporate  bond  market:  The  corporate  bond 
market has grown over the years to a size of USD 447 billion of outstanding stock as 
at the end of March 2019, clocking an annualised growth rate of 13.5% during the 
last  four  years.  Issuances  are  predominantly  through  private  placement  and 
dominated by high credit issuers. In 2018-19, 79% of the issuances were by entities 
rated ‘A’ or higher. Secondary market trading has also picked up in the recent past, 
with trading volumes rising from USD 170 billion in FY 2014-15 to USD 267 billion in 
2018-19. Trading is entirely OTC with trades settled bilaterally and reported to stock 
exchanges.

2.6 Recent developments in the corporate bond market: Consistent investment 
interest  by  domestic  institutions  like  mutual  funds,  pension  funds  and  insurance 
funds  as  well  as  foreign  portfolio  investors  (FPIs)  has  helped  in  developing  the 
corporate bond market.  Tri-party repo (“sale  and repurchase”) in corporate bonds 
has  been  introduced  by  the  exchanges  recently  with  a  view  to  encourage  trading 
interest.  Implementation  of  the  Insolvency  and  Bankruptcy  Code  (IBC)  starting 
December  2016  is  expected  to  go  a  long  way  in  improving  participation  in  the 
corporate bond market by strengthening the protection of creditor rights, in a market 
presently characterised by one of the lowest recovery rates (25%) in the world (Chart 
5).  With  greater  confidence  in  time-bound  and  efficient  resolutions  under  the  IBC, 
foreign  investors  are  likely  to  explore  investment  in  sub-investment  grade  and 
distressed corporate assets.

2.7  Investor  Base:  There  has  been  a  conscious  and  continuous  effort  by  the 
Reserve  Bank  to  expand  the  investor  base  and  thereby  liquidity  of  the  markets  it 
regulates,  while  preserving  financial  stability.  The  investor  base  for  G-Secs,  for 
instance, has expanded over the past decade in terms of an increase in the share of 
holdings by insurance companies and corporates and a corresponding decrease in 
the share of holding by commercial banks (Chart 6). In parallel, calibrated access for 
global  investors  through  the  FPI  route  is  helping  broaden  the  investor  base,  while 
also bringing in diversity of trading views and strategies.

2.8 Funding and Derivatives Markets: A necessary condition for the development 
of capital markets is the existence of funding and securities lending markets as well 
as derivative markets for risk transfer. Repo funding in Indian G-Secs is fairly deep 
with average daily volume of about USD 20 billion (Chart 7). In case of interest rate 
derivatives, there is reasonable liquidity in Interest Rate Futures (IRF) and Overnight 
 10 
 
Indexed  Swaps  (OIS)  markets5.  Much  of  the  recent  increase  in  activity  can  be 
attributed to the Reserve Bank allowing non-residents to participate in interest rate 
derivatives markets for both hedging and trading purposes.

3. Policy initiatives in India  
What  has  enabled  the  growth  of  Indian  capital  markets  to  reach  this  stage?  To 
answer  this,  I  will  now  discuss  the  policy  measures  taken  in  India  vis-à-vis  the 
findings and recommendations of the CGFS Report. 
 3.1 Enabling environment 
3.1.1 Macroeconomic Stability 
India’s GDP growth has been one of the highest among large economies during the 
last decade and half (Chart 8). Double digit inflation of few years prior to the “taper 
tantrum” episode has been tamed, facilitated by a shift by the Reserve Bank  in 2016 
                                                            
5 An Overnight Index Swap (OIS) is an interest rate swap agreement where a fixed rate is swapped 
against a pre-determined published index of a daily overnight reference rate for an agreed period. 
6 Triparty repo in G-Secs went live on November 05, 2018. In tri-party repo, a third party acts as a 
central counterparty between the two originating parties of a repo transaction. Currently, the Clearing 
Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL) acts as the “triparty agent” for the G-Secs, while the Bombay Stock 
Exchange  (BSE)  and  the  National  Stock  Exchange  (NSE)  operate  as  triparty  agents  for  corporate 
bonds.

  to flexible inflation targeting with a headline target of 4% (+/- 2%) for the Monetary 
Policy Committee (MPC). High levels of inflation make holdings of financial assets 
economically unattractive relative to non-financial assets such as housing and gold. 
The important reform of flexible inflation targeting, helped by low oil prices and food 
supply management, has kept the headline inflation under control during the last 5 
years, relative to the MPC’s mandated target (Chart 9). This way, two preconditions 
of  macroeconomic  stability  ––  stable  growth  and  low  inflation  ––  necessary  for 
financialisation of savings and capital market development are now in place in India.

3.1.2 Promoting market autonomy 
a. Rationalising regulatory guidelines and procedures 
In active coordination with the government and other financial market regulators, the 
Reserve  Bank  has  undertaken  a  series  of  reforms  and  rationalisation  of  existing 
policies. These measures also seek to ensure financial stability and instil confidence 
among stakeholders. Some important examples include:  
Liberalising the process for innovation of new products; 
(i) 
(ii)  Moving away from a prescriptive approach to a principle-based regulatory 
approach; 
(iii)  Minimising  interference  in  the  market  process  by  eschewing  ad-hoc 
‘approvals’; and, 
(iv)  Attempting  to  achieve  comprehensive  market  regulations  by  addressing 
gaps,  in  particular,  by  issuing  market  abuse  regulations  and  benchmark 
regulations, as well as regulating trading platforms. 
   13 
 
b. Development of financial market institutions and infrastructure 
 A  well-developed  and  reliable  infrastructure  is  a  prerequisite  for  safe  and  efficient 
functioning of financial markets. Acknowledging this principle, the Reserve Bank has 
taken  several  steps  to  put  in  place  an  effective  infrastructure  in  the  markets  it 
regulates, the salient steps being:  
(i) 
(ii) 
Introduction  of  an  anonymous  trading  platform  for  G-Sec  called  the 
Negotiated Dealing System-Order Matching (NDS-OM); 
Introduction  of  Legal  Entity  Identifier  code  (LEI)  for  OTC  derivatives 
markets as well as non-derivatives markets; 
(iii)  Development of a foreign exchange trading platform (Fx-Retail) aimed at 
bringing down transactions costs for retail users (August 2019); and, 
(iv)  Constituting  an  independent  financial  benchmark  administrator,  viz.,  the 
Financial Benchmarks of India Ltd. (FBIL).  
 
c. Macro-prudential management of investment restrictions for domestic and 
foreign investors 
It has been a constant endeavour of the Reserve Bank to rationalise, and wherever 
consistent  with  macro-prudential  objectives,  to  relax  restrictions  in  the  form  of 
investment limits imposed on the market participants:  
(i) 
The Reserve Bank has reduced the Statutory Liquidity Requirement (SLR) 
stipulation on the minimum percentage of Net Demand and Time Liabilities 
(NDTL)  to  be  held  in  G-Secs  and  SDLs  by  banks  in  a  calibrated  way 
(Chart  10)  from  close  to  40%  in  1990  to  below  20%  at  present.  This 
important  relaxation  has  resulted  in  a  greater  flexibility  for  banks  in  their 
investment decisions and added to the diversity of investor base in G-Secs 
and SDLs (Chart 6) –– which, in turn, have aided efficient pricing of these 
bonds.

(ii) 
 
The  Reserve  Bank  has  been  calibrating  access  for  Foreign  Portfolio 
Investors  (FPIs)  in  debt  markets  to  provide  them  greater  latitude  in 
managing  their  portfolios  in  terms  of  increased  FPI  investment  limits 
(Charts 11 and 12) as well as expanded eligibility of instruments and tenor 
for FPI investments.  
(iii)  Recently, the Reserve Bank has introduced the Voluntary Retention Route 
(VRR) scheme to relax the macro-prudential restrictions for FPIs that are 
willing to retain a significant portion of their investments in the country for a 
minimum retention period (presently three years).

3.1.3 Strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for investor protection 
One  of  the  most  critical  building  blocks  of  market  infrastructure  is  a  proper  legal 
framework  which  ensures  investor  protection  by  acting  as  a  deterrent  to  market 
abuse and malpractices. In India, the Public Debt Act (1944), the Securities Contract 
Regulation  Act  (1956)  and  the  Government  Securities  Act  (2006)  govern  the 
 16 
  formalisation of issuance and transfer of securities. In parallel, the Reserve Bank of 
India  Act  (1934)  confers  powers  on  the  Reserve  Bank  to  regulate  money, 
derivatives,  repo  and  government  securities  markets.  With  the  Insolvency  and 
Bankruptcy  Code  (IBC)  (December  2016),  the  legal  framework  for  financial 
regulation is also moving closer to being comprehensive and effective in the context 
of non-financial corporate borrowers. However, the lack of resolution framework for 
non-bank financial entities remains a crucial gap that deserves prompt attention of 
the authorities. 
 
3.2 Capital market specific drivers 
Let  me  now  turn  to  some  of  the  other  important  drivers  of  market  development  in 
India and also highlight some critical areas for improvement. 
3.2.1 Disclosure regime 
As  per  the  cross-country  survey  findings  of  the  CGFS  Report,  proper  and  timely 
disclosure  by  the  issuers  in  corporate  bond  market  is  a  prerequisite  for  gaining 
investors’ confidence in this market. Conversely, lack of adequate disclosures raises 
the financing costs of corporates, especially sub-investment grade ones, and keeps 
the capital markets small. Recognising this, regulators in India have emphasised and 
mandated high quality and timely disclosures by issuers. However, a few instances 
of  recent  defaults  in  commercial  paper  and  corporate  bond  markets  have  raised 
concerns  about  the  quality  of  disclosures,  even  for  investment-grade  firms.  These 
concerns  are  worthy  of  careful  scrutiny  and  assessment  relative  to  the  best 
international practices to help fine-tune standards for the timely disclosure of default-
relevant information by corporates.   
3.2.2 Deepening the domestic institutional base 
Expanding the investor base leads to increasing diversity in the market (see section 
2.7).  Efforts  in  this  direction  need  to  be  sustained,  with  a  particular  focus  on  the 
domestic institutional investor base. Improving pension and insurance coverage for 
households can be a priority as it not only leads to social welfare outcomes, but also 
leads  to  a  stronger  and  more  stable  investor  base  for  capital  markets.  Better 
financialisation  of  household  savings  could  be  a  catalyst  for  retail  participation  in 
 17 
  markets, in turn providing a boost to collective investment vehicles such as mutual 
funds and alternative investment funds (AIFs). 
3.2.3 Bi-directional opening of markets to international participation 
One  of  the  key  drivers  of  market  development  recognised  in  the  CGFS  Report  is 
opening up of the market to foreign participants although it entails managing global 
spillover  risks.  The  Reserve  Bank  has  taken  calibrated  steps  in  opening  up  its 
regulated  markets  to  foreign  participants  as  discussed  earlier  and  also  allowed 
domestic players to participate in overseas markets:  
(i) 
(ii) 
 
(iii) 
In  consultation  with  the  government,  the  Reserve  Bank  has  decided  to 
permit  offshore  trading  and  settlement  of  G-Secs  through  International 
Central Securities Depositories (ICSD) for non-residents who do not want 
to undergo the domestic FPI registration procedure.  
 
The recently issued draft of regulations for hedging currency risk embodies 
many of the drivers identified by the CGFS report –– product innovation, 
opening  up  markets  to  non-residents  and  simplified  hedging  guidelines 
which offer greater flexibility to users.  
Similarly, in March 2018, the Reserve Bank freed up overseas hedging by 
residents  of  commodity  price  risk  and  freight  risk  overseas.  Residents 
were permitted to hedge both direct and indirect commodity risk through 
specified instruments. For direct exposure, all price risk on all commodities 
is  now  permitted  to  be  hedged  overseas,  while  for  indirect  exposure, 
residents  can  hedge  overseas  the  price  risk  on  industrial  metals  only. 
Further,  revised  directions  treat  risks  acquired  from  domestic  and  cross-
border transactions at par.  
To manage the global spillover risks arising from such reforms, prudential limits have 
been in place alongside most of these reforms to ensure consistency with the overall 
state of capital account liberalisation for India and anchor macro-prudential risks at 
manageable levels. 
  18 
 
 
3.2.4 Developing complementary markets  
 Deep and liquid complementary markets like repo and derivatives play a crucial role 
in  the  growth  of  the  cash  markets  as  they  help  investors  in  funding  and  hedging. 
Over  the  past  few  years,  the  Reserve  Bank  has  taken  measures  to  help  develop 
repo markets for both Government securities and corporate bonds. Introduction of tri-
party  repo  (August  2017)  has  been  a  success  for  the  G-Sec  market;  however,  tri-
party repo is yet to pick up in the corporate bond market. Similarly, securities lending 
(“market  repo”)  works  well  for  G-Secs  although  wider  participation  (especially  by 
large holders of G-Secs like mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds) 
is required to avoid occasional episodes of excessive volatility in borrowing costs. All 
these  regulatory  measures  have  resulted  in  a  consistent  growth  in  liquidity  in  the 
repo markets. 
To  boost  derivatives  markets,  efforts  are  required  in  encouraging  better  risk 
management by domestic institutions, especially banks. With the untapped interest 
rate derivatives market set for a pickup in the risk management activity of banks and 
non-banks, the role of complementary markets will strengthen in the years to follow. 
 
3.3 Other recent initiatives 
Let  me  conclude  by  enumerating  four  of  the  important  initiatives  underway  to 
develop Indian capital markets further: 
a. Task Force on Offshore Rupee Markets 
The Reserve Bank constituted a Task Force in February 2019 to examine in depth 
issues  relating  to  the  offshore  Rupee  markets  and  recommend  appropriate  policy 
measures to  align  incentives  for  non-residents  to  gradually  move  to  the  domestic 
market for their hedging requirements and also to ensure the stability of the external 
value of the Rupee. The Report of the Task Force is due by mid-July 2019. 
b. Internal Working Group on Market Timings 
The Reserve Bank has set up an Internal Working Group on Market Timings which 
will  comprehensively  review  the  timings  of  various  markets  that  are  under  the 
purview of the Reserve Bank, and will assess the necessary payment and settlement 
 19 
  infrastructure  that  can  support  co-ordinated  timings  across  these  markets.  The 
Working Group’s Report, after submission, will be released for public feedback.  
 c. Task Force on the Development of Secondary Market for Corporate Loans 
The Reserve Bank has constituted a Task Force on the Development of Secondary 
Market for Corporate  Loans.  It  will  suggest  required  policies  for  facilitating  the 
development  of  a  secondary  market  in  corporate  loans,  including  loan  transaction 
platform  for  stressed  assets,  creation  of  a  loan  contract  registry,  its  ownership 
structure  and  related  protocols  such  as  the  standardization  of  loan  information, 
independent validation and data access. The Report of the Task Force is due by the 
end of August 2019. 
d. Committee on the Development of Housing Finance Securitisation Market 
The Reserve Bank constituted this committee to assess the state of housing finance 
securitisation  markets  in  India;  study  the  best  international  practices  as  well  as 
lessons  learnt  from  the  global  financial  crisis;  and  propose  measures  to  further 
develop  these  markets  in  India  by  identifying  critical  steps  required  such  as,  inter 
alia, definition of conforming mortgages, mortgage documentation standards, digital 
registry for ease of due diligence and verification by investors, avenues for trading in 
securitised  assets,  etc.  The  Report  of  the  Committee  is  due  by  the  end  of  August 
2019. 
In  summary,  it  should  be  clear  that  while  Indian  capital  markets  have  evolved 
steadily to a stage of long-run viability, the potential for developing and strengthening 
them further is limitless… 
  “Let us, then, be up and doing, 
With a heart for any fate; 
Still achieving, still pursuing, 
Learn to labour and to wait.”
