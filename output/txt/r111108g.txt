José De Gregorio: Chile’s approach to external turbulences and threats 
Speech by Mr José De Gregorio, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, at the “Economic 
and  Entrepreneurial  Vision  2011–2012”,  organized  by  the  Manufacturers  Association 
SOFOFA and Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, 19 October 2011. 
 I thank the valuable comments of Luis Álvarez, Luis Óscar Herrera and Enrique Orellana. 
In  the  past  several  years  we  have  endured  macroeconomic  turbulences  of  unbelievable 
magnitude, as well as new challenges. The years 2007 and 2008 saw a sharp increase in 
inflation, then came the global financial crisis and the recession of 2009, to be topped off by 
an earthquake and a tsunami in February 2010. Today we can say that we weathered this 
string of difficulties but we remain on the alert, because the threats from the world economy 
are far from over. 
These  days,  our  greatest  concern  is  the  state  of  the  developed  economies  and  its 
ramifications on the emerging world and particularly Chile. In mid-2009, the world economy 
began to recover from the effects of the international financial crisis. However, such recovery 
featured two different speeds (figure 1). The emerging economies have grown strongly and 
have  had  to  deal  with  risks  of  inflationary  pressures  and  fast  credit  growth,  while  the 
developed economies have recovered slowly. Since the middle of last year, we have stated 
in our Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Reports that there are many risks still latent. In 
particular, that US growth would weaken and the European sovereign debt would propagate 
from  the  peripheral  economies  to  other  countries  in  the  region.  As  months  have  gone  by 
these risks have materialized.  
The crisis that broke out in 2008 has not finished. Although at first the policies applied around 
the world succeeded in averting immediate damage and an economic depression, there are 
still many issues that have yet to be resolved before it can be left behind. One such issue is 
the  fragile  financial  situation  of  states,  banks  and  households  in  several  developed 
economies. 
In Chile, and in most emerging economies, we have been innocent witnesses of the crisis. It 
has posed new challenges to monetary and financial policy-makers to minimize the impact of 
external  turbulences  and  allow  our  economies  to  continue  along  a  path  of  sustainable 
growth.  The  experience  of  2008–2009  taught  us  lessons  for  our  policy conduct,  but,  more 
importantly, it left us the conviction, not only to policy makers but also to the general public, 
that we are able to mitigate the adversities coming from abroad. Avoiding them is impossible, 
but we can surely mitigate them. 
Chile’s macroeconomic policy framework leans on various pillars that must be tended to. To 
begin with, a fiscal policy that is serious and predictable. Keeping a budget rule based on the 
structural balance, which permits to shield public expenditure from economic fluctuations and 
also empower it to support domestic expenditure when needed, is highly beneficial. A second 
pillar  is  our high  financial  and  commercial  openness.  Although  it  links  us  more  to  external 
shocks, it also permits us to diversify risks, makes us more flexible and facilitates our search 
for  new  markets  and  opportunities.  In  the  distant  past  we  were  a  pretty  closed  economy, 
undiversified and much more vulnerable to the ups and downs of the world economy. A third 
pillar is our strong, well regulated financial system that proved its resilience during the crisis 
of  2008–2009.  Existing  regulation  has  allowed  the  development  of  prudent  banking  not 
engaged in highly risky or toxic instruments. Of course there are areas that lag behind, and it 
is  obvious  that  protection  to  financial  customers  needs  enhancement.  Every  effort  in  that 
direction, which is consistent with keeping a sound financial system, is welcome. Let us recall 
that  the  U.S.  crisis  originated  in  –  among  other  factors  –  a  very  noble  and  pro-customer 
objective:  to  increase  access  to  home  ownership  to  the  less  privileged  population.  The 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

problem  was  that  they  lent  to  the  wrong  people,  based  on  an  expected  ever-increasing 
housing  price  trend  that  proved  unsustainable.  In  Chile,  the  recent  creation  of  a  Financial 
Stability Committee is a step towards helping to prevent this kind of episode from occurring. 
Finally,  there  is  monetary  policy  based  on  an  inflation-targeting  scheme  with  a  floating 
exchange  rate.  This  allows  conducting  monetary  policy  with  transparency  and  with  a  goal 
that  is  clear  and  known  by  everybody.  The  Bank  makes  decisions  aiming  at  expected 
inflation standing  at  3%  over  a  two-year  policy  horizon.  Safeguarding  the  credibility  of  this 
goal is crucial for monetary policy to be an effective tool that not only succeeds in keeping 
inflation low and stable but also helps to reduce the volatility of output and employment. 
Now I would like to take a look at recent macroeconomic developments and their implications 
for the conduct of monetary policy. 
From the high inflation to the great recession 
In the early part of the past decade we enjoyed relative quiet in the macroeconomic front. 
Inflation moderated across the world and the economies resumed their trend growth rates. 
There were some tensions here and there in the region, a mild recession in the U.S. when 
the tech bubble burst, but the years were generally calm. However, towards 2007–2008 we 
were hit by an unusual price shock in foodstuffs and oil that triggered a significant increase in 
inflation around the world (figure 2). In Chile, this shock was visible only in the inflation of 
foods  and  fuels  because  core  inflation  was  contained  (figure  3).  The  Bank  hardened 
monetary  policy,  but  the  unusual  transmission  of  said  prices  to  the  rest  of  the  economy 
caused inflation to deviate largely from the target.  
Several  reasons  explain  the  unusual  propagation  of  this  inflationary  shock  to  other  prices. 
The economy was operating with narrow or even negative output gaps. The cost pressure 
this  generated  combined  with  the  effects  of  the  oil  price increase  on  the  cost  of  electricity 
(figure  4).  Meanwhile,  as  the  crisis  incubated,  the  exchange  rate  depreciated.  Finally,  the 
price hikes began feeding back into inflation expectations. 
Facing  the  resurgence  of  inflation,  we  sped  up  the  process  of  raising  the  monetary  policy 
interest rate (MPR). Between June and September of 2008, we increased it 200 basis points. 
In September of that year, when we still thought we would continue to raise the interest rate 
in order to bring inflation back to the target  – as we had said in Congress early that month –  
came the Lehman Brothers debacle, and the rest is history. 
Uncertainty  and  fear  took  over  investors,  consumers  and  entrepreneurs.  Consumers 
postponed expenses; firms interrupted their projects and depleted inventories; manufacturing 
production  collapsed;  demand  plummeted;  commodity  prices  fell  sharply  and  the  global 
recession  followed.  Chile  was  not  spared.  Domestic  demand  also  fell  with  unprecedented 
force. Sales came to a halt (figure 5). 
Although the inflation scenario was still complex  – it peaked at 9.9% in October 2008 – , a 
slowdown was foreseen that suggested changing the orientation of monetary policy. Growth 
projections plummeted unusually fast in every region of the world, going from a moderation 
to  a  recession  (figure  6).  Chile  was  no  exception.  In  November  2008  we  modified  our 
predictions and pointed out that the economic slowdown would entail a drop in inflation, not 
only  because  of  the  sharp  fall  in  commodity  prices,  but  mainly  because  of  the  sudden 
creation of output gaps. We then observed that most likely we would begin cutting down the 
MPR in the coming months, which set out the process of financial easing.  
Subsequently,  we  started  an  unprecedented  –  in  terms  of  size  and  speed  –  process  of 
interest rate cuts that was one of the largest in the world, bringing the MPR to developed-
economy levels. Between January and July of 2009, we cur 775 basis points off the MPR 
and also established a mechanism – the term-liquidity-facility, FLAP – to grant funds to the 
financial system at the same rate as the MPR for a six-month period (figure 7).

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
Time  and  again  I  wonder  what  else  we  could  have  done  to  cushion  the  international 
recession. In hindsight, it is difficult to think that macroeconomic policies could have averted 
the  collapse  in  demand,  considering  its  size  and  speed,  and  particularly  because  it  was 
triggered by a severe deterioration in economic expectations. The normal lags of monetary 
and fiscal policies do not allow containing such a major drop in economic activity while it is 
happening. 
Nonetheless,  expansionary  measures  were  key  to  attenuate  the  fall  and  also  boost  the 
expansion that began in the second quarter of 2009 and continues to this day. The recession 
was  severe,  but  short.  The  monetary  stimulus  was  vital  in  getting  out  of  the  recession  so 
quickly. 
Our economy was recovering strongly until it was smashed by an earthquake and tsunami in 
February 2010, with devastating consequences. Our first obligation after the catastrophe was  
– concerning the Bank’s legal mandate – to ensure that the payment system could function 
properly,  especially  in  the  worst  affected  areas,  in  which  we  succeeded.  From  the 
macroeconomic standpoint, output was significantly hurt during the first half of the year. In 
March 2010 the Imacec dropped 2% y-o-y, but in some sectors (e.g., manufacturing) it fell 
20%.  The  effects  on  activity  lasted  a  couple  of  months.  Our  estimates  indicate  that  the 
earthquake and tsunami ate up one point of growth in 2010. We also predicted  – correctly –  
that an important part of this drop in output would turn into stronger growth during the first 
half of 2011. 
The fast recovery of economic activity in the aftermath of such a catastrophe leaned on our 
efficient  productive  sector  and  existing  favorable  financial  conditions.  The  MPR  was  at  its 
lowest of 0.5% since July 2009, and as we had said, we expected to keep it there still for a 
few  more  months.  Thus,  after  a  couple  of  months  of  adjustment,  output,  employment  and 
investment  recovered  from  the  recession  of  2009  and  left  behind  the  macroeconomic 
consequences of the disaster with renewed vigor (figure 8). 
Almost  coinciding  with  the  earthquake,  and  after  twenty  years,  there  was  a  change  in  the 
ruling  coalition,  which  demanded  agreements  and  coordination  with  the  new  government 
authorities. I must acknowledge that there were no difficulties there, and thanks to the Bank’s 
accumulated experience in these matters, the transition was very smooth. 
The risk of overheating and forex pressures 
Economic recovery continued over the course of 2010, but at the turn of 2011 we faced new 
macroeconomic challenges. Preoccupations again centered on world developments, due to 
tensions associated to the two-speed recovery. Emerging countries, with their output gaps 
narrowed  or  closed  had  to  deal  with  their  economies’  overheating  and  related  inflationary 
pressures.  Furthermore,  they  began  having  strong  exchange  rate  pressures  due  to  their 
better relative position in the world, capital inflows and the need for global imbalances to be 
resolved.  Several  economies’  exchange  rates  dropped  to  their  lowest  in  the  last  decade 
(figure  9).  Only  very  recently  have  we  seen  some  reversal  because  of  a  terms-of-trade 
deterioration and increased risk aversion around the world. 
Chile  has  been  no  exception.  Although  in  net  terms  capital  inflows  were  not  large,  our 
currency also strengthened, not a surprise in a scenario of vigorous growth and very good 
terms of trade. The nominal exchange rate posted a significant appreciation toward the end 
of 2010, while the real exchange rate hit levels below the averages of the last 15 to 20 years 
(figure 10). 
The  current  exchange  rate  tensions  originate  in  some  long-lasting  phenomena  in  the 
international  economy.  Global  imbalances  are  still  unresolved,  and  part  of  the  solution 
requires that the countries that enjoy a better position today (i.e., emerging en commodity-
exporting  economies)  redirect  part  of  their  demand  to  those  that  are  worse  off  –  the 
developed  economies.  Once  the  latter  regain  their  strength,  their  currencies  will  hopefully 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

follow  suit.  However,  the  transition  may  take  long  and  therefore  exceptional  policies  have 
been necessary to help mitigate these tensions. 
Like other emerging economies, early this year we decided to intervene the forex market, by 
launching a reserve hoarding program that would permit productive sectors to make orderly 
adjustments  to  what  we  foresaw  as  a  protracted  exchange  rate  stress  situation.  We 
announced that we would purchase 12 billion dollars over the course of this year, and so far 
we  have  purchased  10  billion.  We  have  done  this  intervention  in  a  non-discretional  and 
sterilized way in order to preserve our policy-making capacities intact and avoid becoming 
ourselves a source of volatility.  
Importantly,  this  purchase  of  international  reserves  has  been  intended  not  only  to  reduce 
exchange rate tensions, but also to strengthen our international liquidity position. Evidence 
shows  that  a  strong  international  reserves  position  helps  shield  the  economy  from  the 
adverse  effects  of  external  financial  shocks.  The  level  of  reserves  we  pursue  with  this 
program will put us on a good standing to deal with a more pronounced global decline. 
As I said, at the beginning of the year the macroeconomic scenario suffered major changes. 
The  increase  in  commodity  prices  and  the  closing  of  output  gaps  stoked  fears  of  a 
resurgence  of  inflation  comparable  to  that  of  2007–2008.  Our  communiqué  of  the  future 
course of monetary policy changed significantly in just a few months. Since March, the Bank 
accelerated the withdrawal of the monetary impulse, with greater intensity than foreseen by 
analysts’ consensus, bringing the MPR to a level within the normal range. This, coupled with 
the  changed  external  macroeconomic  scenario  due  to  the  drop  in  commodity  prices, 
managed to contain inflation expectations (figure 11). While in mid-year we expected inflation 
to be around 4% for much of the second half, the data have shown inflation hovering around 
3%. The propagation of specific shocks has been similar to the historical average, but lower 
than  that  of  2007  and  2008.  Today,  in  Chile  and  in  a  large  part  of  the  emerging  world, 
inflation  forecasts  have  been  lowered  and  the  risk  of  overheating  has  lost  relevance 
(figure 12). For the same reason, while in mid-year we foresaw that the MPR would end the 
year  2011  close  to  6%,  in  recent  months  we  said  that  there  will  probably  be  no  more 
increases, an opinion we have reaffirmed in our latest communiqués and I will come back to 
shortly. But first let me take a look at what is going on in the developed world. 
The 2008 crisis is not over yet 
The crisis of 2008 was not a typical recession because it originated in a financial meltdown, 
whose  effects  are  deeper  and  its  recovery,  slower.  This  we  know  first-hand  in  emerging 
countries. In Chile we had one in the early 1980s. 
The  financial  stress  episodes  of  the  past  few  weeks  are  part  of  a  growing  uncertainty 
regarding  the  strength  of  the  recovery  in  the  developed  world.  In  this  context,  two 
phenomena occurred that triggered the current fragility. First, between July and August we 
witnessed the debate in the U.S. Congress on raising the fiscal debt ceiling  – an illustration 
of the difficulties of the American political system to deal with their problems in this area – , 
plus  the  downgrading  of  their  sovereign  debt  rating.  Second,  sovereign  debt  problems  in 
peripheral  Europe,  notably  Greece,  expanded  into  central  European  economies  such  as 
Spain and Italy. 
In the U.S., the focus of the debate has shifted to the state of the economy and the possibility 
of a double-dip recession. The high levels of household debt and the difficulties to resolve 
the  real-estate  problem  are  yet  to  be  resolved  and  will  probably  take  a  while.  The  labor 
market  is  being  unable  to  pick  up.  The  Central  Bank  and  the  fiscal  authority,  as  in  other 
developed  economies,  have  no  room  for  new  stimulus  measures  to  make  up  for  the 
weakness  of  private  demand  (figure  13).  The Fed  announced  that  it would  hold the  policy 
rate  low  at  least  through  mid-2013  and  also  a  purchase  of  long-term  bonds  financed  with 
short-term instruments. Since the Fed has the short-term rate at its lowest and the economy 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches
needs further monetary stimulus, this measure is intended to flatten the yield curve, reducing 
long-term rates. The Fed’s own estimates indicate that its effects should be similar to what 
would  result  with  a  policy  rate  cut  of  50  basis  points.  This  is  surely  an  effort  in  the  right 
direction, but its incidence will be limited because of their weak economic situation. 
The problems in Europe are more severe and worrisome because of its consequences on 
the world economy and financial markets. Europe is at the core of any debate on the state of 
the world economy. The serious insolvency of one country, Greece, which is a tiny fraction of 
the  Eurozone,  spread  throughout  the  continent  as  a  major  confidence  crisis  (figure  14). 
There is a vicious circle from weak growth to weak fiscal accounts to weak banking. 
The crisis is in full swing, and its resolution is uncertain. Unlike what could be expected in the 
first  half  of  the  year,  the  market  does  not  rule  out  a  disorderly  resolution  of  Greece’s 
problems, which could result in a default of its sovereign debt and, in a worst-case scenario, 
in  its  departure  from  the  euro.  This  could  be  very  costly,  so  the  Eurozone  authorities  are 
fiercely committed to helping it out. 
The  proposals  under  discussion  call  for  a  firewall  to  avoid  the  contagion  of  the  sovereign 
debt, recapitalizing banks and find a solution to the specific case of Greece. This is obviously 
difficult to do without first having established the firewall for the rest of the region. In principle, 
a “simple” alternative would be to set a large fund to guarantee the European sovereign debt 
and  help  recapitalize  the  banks.  Its  sole  existence  would  reinstate  confidence,  reduce  risk 
premiums and restore the viability to sovereigns and financial institutions. The trouble is that 
the  European  legislation  does  not  have  the  institutions  to  implement  these  solutions.  And 
they must define the fiscal support that such measures would require and how to allocate the 
burden among the participants. It is precisely on these fronts that the authorities are working 
and  hopefully  a  solution  can  be  arrived  at  in  the  short  term.  Otherwise,  the  European 
situation will continue to hold the world under a lot of pressure still for some months. 
Moreover,  some  countries  in  the  Eurozone  are  facing  serious  competitiveness  problems, 
thus depressing growth and, since they have no foreign exchange mechanism, solving them 
will take time because it requires flexibility and structural reforms to boost productivity. 
Monetary policy implications 
Today, in Chile, the expected course of the economy and monetary policy has changed from 
the beginning of the year. The focus is now on the effects that the weak global economy will 
have on the Chilean economy, especially on growth and inflation. About the former, we said 
in our last Monetary Policy Report that Chile’s growth would be in the 6.25%–6.75% range 
this year, to decline in 2012 to 4.25%– 5.25%. This lower growth, beyond the possible effects 
of  the  adverse  external  scenario,  responds  mostly  to  the  economy  converging  to  trend-
consistent growth rates, which we estimate to be around 5%. We are facing a very complex 
external scenario. 
In  last  Thursday’s  monetary  policy  meeting  communiqué  we  said  that  the  deepening  of 
international  economic  trends  could  shape  a  more  adverse  scenario  than  the  baseline 
assumed in the September Monetary Policy Report, with potential consequences for growth 
and inflation in Chile, as well as for the orientation of monetary policy. 
Accordingly,  we  are  paying  close  attention  to  external  developments  and  we  have  the 
necessary flexibility to act whenever necessary. However, I would like to pause to examine 
two aspects. First, it is important for monetary policy not to react too little, too late. But just as 
important it is that it does not act haphazardly. A monetary policy that keeps changing signs 
because  of  mistaken  diagnoses  loses  credibility.  Potential  delays  can  be  compensated  by 
being aggressive. That was the case between end of 2008 and beginning of 2009. We could 
have reduced the rate a couple of months earlier, but because inflation was so high and the 
economic outlook was so uncertain, it could have hurt the credibility of our monetary policy. 
In this context, a policy rate cut would have ultimately been slower and less effective. Once 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

the severity of the situation was confirmed, we reduced the rate with unprecedented force 
and with much success. 
Secondly, changes in the policy rate affect the economy primarily through its effects on the 
overall interest rate structure, that is, on the rates at different terms. The withdrawal of the 
tightening  bias  that  monetary  policy  applied  until  last  August,  and  the  changes  in  the 
international  scenario  have  brought  down  long-term  interest  rates  significantly  in  Chile, 
reducing  financial  costs  (figure  15).  However,  the  transmission  to  lending  rates  can  be 
attenuated by increased financial and economic risks. 
Overall, we must note that the recent interest rate reduction has been possible thanks to our 
credible monetary policy, with clear objectives and orientation. Chile is one of the countries 
featuring  the  largest  drops  in  long  rates.  Said  rates  reflect,  first,  the  expected  average  of 
future monetary policy interest rates. When there is no clarity or credibility with respect to the 
orientation of monetary policy, interest rate movements are less informative about their future 
course and have a lesser incidence on long-term rates, or can even have the opposite effect. 
In  contrast,  when  they  respond  to  credible  policies,  based  on  clear  communication  and  a 
rigorous  assessment  of  the  state  and  prospects  of  the  economy,  then  the  interest  rate 
structure,  and  not  only  the  short-term  rate,  will  respond  to  changes  in  the  orientation  of 
monetary policy. That is why our commitment with the inflation target and the solid grounds 
where we base our decisions are essential. 
Final remarks 
There are good reasons for us to feel confident facing the crisis in developed economies. We 
know  how  to  confront  international  recessions  and  financial  turbulences.  We  did  so  just  a 
couple of years ago and we designed instruments that ensure the proper functioning of the 
financial  system.  Inflation  is  close  to  the  target  and  the  policy  rate  is  within  a  range  we 
consider normal. The fiscal policy also has room to maneuver like few countries in the world. 
But there are also good reasons to be worried. We don’t know for how long the emerging 
economies can grow if the developed ones are still weak. How long can China sustain world 
growth? Do all the emerging economies have fiscal room to back a weak scenario, or it has 
been shrinking after the strong stimulus packages of 2008–2009?  
And there are the local tensions, too. Certainly, the climate of political and social unrest is not 
the most appropriate to confront a further deterioration of the world economy. For the same 
reason, this scenario imposes more than ever the challenge of building an effective solution 
for 
these  specific  problems,  but  always  safeguarding  macroeconomic  stability  and 
strengthening our capacity to grow. This is not only about the specific policies we apply, but 
also about how we resolve our problems. 
As much as some have trouble admitting – it seems that the trendy thing is to complain about 
everything  –  our  country  is  exemplary.  In  the  past  few  decades,  all  of  us  Chileans  have 
enjoyed progress like never before in our history. And, granted, there are many tasks ahead, 
we are a role model for many countries. In this conjuncture we must also set an example 
resolving  urgent  and  critical  problems  and  continuing  building  an  ever  more  prosperous 
country for all. 
Thank you.
