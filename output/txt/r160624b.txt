Report

Finance  Commission  of the  Honorable  Senate  of the  Republic,  Santiago  de  Chile,  6  June 
2016.

Introduction 
Mr.  President  of  the  Senate’s  Finance  Commission,  Senator  Andrés  Zaldívar,  senators 
members of this Commission, ladies and gentlemen, 
Thank  you  for  your  invitation  to  present  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile’s  vision  on  the  recent 
macroeconomic  and  financial  developments,  prospects  and  implications  for  monetary  and 
financial  policy  making.  This  vision  is  contained  in  detail  in  our  Monetary  Policy  Report  of 
June 2016 and our Financial Stability Report of the first half 2016. 
Over the last few months, the economy evolved in line with estimates in our March Report. 
Inflation  declined  to  4.2  percent  annually  and  our  new  baseline  projections  –  which  I  will 
share with you in a moment – indicate that it will return to the tolerance range within a few 
months. 
On economic activity, first-quarter GDP growth outperformed our March forecast. However, 
this year’s outlook foresees that it will remain below potential still for some quarters. 
The  world  economy  continues  to  be  marked  by  expectations  about  the  Federal  Reserve 
(Fed)’s  decision  on  the  trajectory  of  its  monetary  policy  normalization,  and  by  the  risks 
coming from the Chinese authorities’ efforts to meet the country’s target growth rates. During 
most of the quarter, the markets’ assessment of these phenomena resulted in a loosening of 
financial conditions compared with the beginning of the year. Most recently, however, these 
trends have been partly reversed. Thus, our new baseline scenario assumes that our trading 
partners will post similar growth rates to those of 2015, but external lending conditions will be 
tighter and commodity prices will remain below their long-term levels. 
In this context, we have held the monetary policy rate (MPR) at 3.5 percent annually and we 
foresee that, within our forecast horizon, further increases will be necessary. Of course, this 
will  be  contingent  on  incoming  information  about  the  projected  inflation  dynamics.  Thus,  if 
new indicators point at higher expected inflation, monetary policy will need to be tightened, 
and  vice-versa.  In  any  case,  we  have  maintained  a  significantly  expansionary  monetary 
stance, which will remain so in the scenario we believe to be the most likely. 
Let me share with you the workings of our baseline scenario and the main risks we perceive, 
which are depicted in the Reports I am presenting now. 
Macroeconomic scenario 
As  I  said  before,  in  recent  months  both  headline  (CPI)  and  core  (CPIEFE)  inflation  have 
behaved as expected. By components of the CPIEFE, goods inflation began showing a more 
moderate expansion, with y-o-y variation going from nearly 5 percent at the end of 2015 to 
4.4  percent  in  the  latest  figure.  This  responds  largely  to  the  fact  that,  despite  important 
fluctuations, the  exchange rate  has  not  shown  a  comparable  increase  to  the  one  between 
mid- 2013 and third-quarter 2015. CPIEFE services inflation has also slowed, but is still near 
5  percent  annually,  reflecting  past-inflation  indexation  and  the  effects  of  the  depreciation.

Plus, gaps are still narrow and the labor market – despite a somewhat faster deterioration 
lately – still shows low unemployment rates and strong growth in nominal wages (figure 1). 
So, in our most likely scenario, annual CPI inflation will enter the tolerance range in the third 
quarter of this year and will approach 3 percent during the first half of 2017 (figure 2). This 
projection uses as a working assumption that the real exchange rate (RER) will hover around 
its current values throughout the projection horizon. Bear in mind that the RER has risen a 
little  since  the  cutoff  date  of  the  last  Report,  to  near  97  (index,  1986=100)  (figure  3).  The 
convergence of inflation is also linked to output gaps that are forecast to widen in the near 
future and with the labor market adjusting further during the year, especially helping drive a 
reduction – albeit moderate – of services inflation. 
Regarding  output, 
figures  exceeded  March 
expectations,  influenced  by  improved  figures  in  agriculture  and,  somewhat  less,  mining. 
Overall, our growth outlook is essentially unchanged. We expect the economy to continue to 
grow  below  potential  for  some  quarters,  due  mainly  to  poor  performance  of  those  sectors 
with  closer  links  with  investment.  Anyway,  it  is  worth  noting  that  retail  trade  and  personal 
services  have  proven  more  resilient,  reflecting  a  more  gradual  adjustment  on  the 
consumption side. 
The baseline scenario of this Report sees GDP growing between 1.25 and 2.0 percent this 
year and between 2 and 3 percent in 2017. This estimate is based on the assumption that 
the  economy  will  resume  near-potential  growth  towards  the  end  of  the  projection  horizon. 
Finally,  it  uses  as  a  working  assumption  that  public  expenditure  will  follow  a  trajectory 
consistent  with  the  fiscal  rule  and  the  Administration’s  announced  budgetary  consolidation 
path. 
The  process  of  growth  normalization  will  be  slow.  Of  particular  concern  is  the  behavior  of 
investment,  which  the  baseline  scenario  estimates  will  drop  for  the  third  year  in  a  row. 
Indeed,  this  year  several  indicators,  among  which  the  survey  of  the  Capital  Goods 
Corporation,  the  levels  of  imports  of  capital  goods  and  business  confidence,  anticipate  a 
further drop in investment. Moreover, the housing sector will have a limited performance after 
being highly dynamic in 2015, and public investment will follow a trajectory consistent with 
the objectives of fiscal consolidation. However, towards 2017 non-mining investment should 
restart growing at a pace matching the recovery of the overall economy (figure 4). 
About the current account, we believe that this year’s deficit will be smaller than we thought 
in March and will show no big changes in 2017. In particular, the trade balance outperformed 
the March forecast in the first quarter, driven mainly by volume exports of goods, especially 
copper, and tourism-related services. Furthermore, a slowdown  in capital goods imports is 
expected  because  of  adjustments  in  investment.  In  addition,  there  are  generally  upward 
revisions to non-copper export prices. Consumption, meanwhile, continues to grow at around 
2 percent. Details of the domestic economy’s baseline scenario are shown in table 1. 
In this context, we foresee further adjustments in the labor market in the coming quarters. 
Lately, annual growth in salaried employment slowed down significantly, to 0.5 percent in the 
last moving quarter. The national unemployment rate has adjusted more gradually, thanks to 
increased self-employment, so it is still low by historic patterns (figure 5). By regions, in the 
north  of  the  country  unemployment  has  risen  more  sharply  than  in  other  areas.  Firms 
interviewed  for  May’s  Business  Perception  Report  –  a  quarterly  publication  of  the  Bank  – 
reveal increased labor availability together with lower wage claims. Looking into the March 
survey  of  the  University  of  Chile,  we  also  see  an  increase  in  the  unemployment  rate  in 
Greater Santiago, to 9.4 percent, confirming the weakening of the labor market. 
The evolution of employment and real wages, which have slowed down in annual terms in 
the last year, implies slower growth in the wage mass. This, coupled with still low household 
expectations, is consistent with positive, yet moderate, growth in consumption (figure 6).

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  Turning to the world economy, as I said, international financial markets have been marked by 
two  situations.  One,  the  US  monetary  policy  normalization  process,  and  two,  the  Chinese 
policy  makers’  efforts to  achieve  their growth  and financial  stability  objectives.  Early  in  the 
quarter the market assumed that the Fed would take things extremely gradually and that the 
Chinese authorities had figured out the policy mix that would allow them to keep growth in 
line with its objectives. Thus, the calm of financial markets that had begun at the close of the 
last  Report  was  prolonged.  Capital  flows  returned  to  the  emerging  world,  stock  markets 
recovered, interest rates dropped and so did spreads, the dollar weakened and commodity 
prices improved. Nonetheless, the increasing doubts about the Chinese financial system and 
the  perception  that  the  US  monetary  policy  will  soon  implement  its  adjustments  –  a  still 
uncertain development – have tended to reverse these trajectories in recent weeks. This has 
been particularly visible in the depreciation of emerging currencies (figure 7). 
Consistently with the volatility we have been seeing and the risks inherent to the international 
economy, our baseline scenario assumes that in the coming quarters international financial 
conditions will be, on average, less favorable than they were in the past two months. 
Our  growth  outlook  for  the  world  economy  and  our  trading  partners  changes  little  from 
March:  3.2  and  3.0  percent,  respectively,  for  the  2016–2017  average.  Still,  there  is  a 
significant revision to expected US growth: 1.9 percent in 2016 (2.3 percent in March). This 
estimate inputs the low output figure of the first quarter, which has to do both with the drop in 
energy  investment  and  the  weak  external  sector.  In  any  case,  aside  from  one-time  data, 
services and labor indicators show a recovering trend and the baseline scenario foresees the 
economy resuming higher growth in 2017. It also estimates that the Chinese economy will be 
able to carry on with its adjustment process without seriously compromising its growth rates. 
But this process will not be free of difficulties. 
The terms of trade will drop again in 2016, although not as sharply as we assumed in the last 
Report, owing mainly to the evolution of non-copper export prices. Considering its trajectory 
of  the  past few  months,  the  baseline  scenario  assumes that  the copper  price  will  average 
US$2.15 and US$2.25 per pound in 2016 and 2017, respectively. For oil, our forecast for the 
same two years is raised to US$45 and US$52 per barrel the Brent-WTI average (table 2). 
About monetary policy, the baseline scenario just described uses as a working assumption 
that the MPR will follow a trajectory that is similar to the one that can be deduced from the 
financial  asset  prices  at  the  statistical  closing  of  this  Report  (figure  8).  This  means  that 
monetary policy  will advance in its normalization throughout the policy horizon, in line  with 
the assumed economic outlook at that horizon, only a little more slowly than we thought in 
March.  Under  this  assumption,  monetary  policy  will  continue  to  provide  a  boost  to  the 
economy. 
It is important to stress that monetary policy has kept a very expansionary stance, helping 
the economy to weather the changes in macroeconomic conditions as best it can. In this way 
it  has  succeeded  in  accommodating  a  significant  depreciation  of  the  peso  and  inflationary 
consequences  without  jeopardizing  our  monetary  policy’s  medium-term  anchor:  inflation 
expectations  two  years  out.  Unlike  other  economies,  we  have  been  able  to  sustain  an 
expansionary  monetary  policy  without  driving  inflation  expectations  away  from  the  target 
(figure 9). 
This expansionary monetary policy is most notorious in market interest rates. On one hand, 
Chile’s long-term rates are low by historic standards and also in a cross-country comparison. 
The same is true for lending rates, which are now below their historic averages and, in the 
case of mortgage loans, even at or near record lows (figure 10). 
Risk scenarios 
As usual, the implementation of monetary policy will respond to incoming information about 
the  projected  inflation  dynamics.  Therefore,  developments  pushing  in  either  direction  will 
prompt the necessary adjustments in monetary policy.

  In the world economy, risks are pretty much the same we identified in the March Report. Still 
critical is the trajectory that the Fed will choose to follow to advance in its monetary policy 
normalization  process.  In  particular,  because  market  expectations  are  still  misaligned  with 
the most likely scenario defined by the Fed itself, especially at longer horizons. The situation 
in China poses a risk because of its possible impact on world growth, and because it might 
trigger new episodes of financial volatility. 
Latin America also poses significant risks to Chile, both because it is a major trading partner 
and  investment  destination,  and  because  of  its  effects  on  the  external  financial  conditions 
facing us. Its macroeconomic challenges are compounded by complex political situations. In 
Brazil,  the  markets  took  the  changes  in  the  political  scene  well,  but  there  are  important 
adjustments pending. Argentina returned to international financial markets, but it also faces 
significant challenges. 
There  are  several  other  factors  that  could  cause  new  or  intensify  ongoing  episodes  of 
financial  volatility,  including  the  UK  referendum  to  define  whether  it  stays  in  or  leaves  the 
European Union, and a number of electoral processes under way around the world that could 
cause  a  shift  towards  protectionism.  However,  the  consolidation  of  economic  growth  in 
Europe and the United States could contribute to boost world activity. 
The possibility of the oil price’s upward trend continuing or steepening is another risk to the 
baseline  scenario,  because  of  both  its  direct  impact  on  local  and  world  inflation,  and  its 
implications on global growth. But there are also reasons for this price to recede to its levels 
of earlier months. Actually, inventories are historically high. 
At  home,  although  inflation  has  diminished  as  expected,  its  high  level  for  many  quarters 
already is still an important risk in the baseline scenario. In the short term, its evolution is still 
closely tied to the exchange rate and therefore to the risks coming from abroad. 
For activity, the risks outlined in previous quarters persist. Confidence remains pessimistic 
and the Chilean economy is receiving a milder impulse from the world economy than it did in 
earlier  years.  The  recent  evolution  of  the  labor  market  stands  out.  If  it  deteriorates  more 
sharply or if the world economy acquires a more adverse configuration, this might result in 
lower GDP growth than forecast. Conversely, if the labor market makes smaller adjustments 
and/or the external economy remains fairly calm, output may perform better than expected. 
This could translate into stronger consumption growth or more favorable investment, or both. 
Upon  assessing  these  risks,  we  estimate that the  risk  balance  is  unbiased for  both  output 
and inflation. 
To sum up, the macroeconomic scenario is, broadly speaking, the same as March’s. Inflation 
will return to the target range in the coming months and output will continue to post bounded 
growth. Investment, however, will be worse than we expected before. The external scenario 
continues  to  present  risks  and  new  volatility  episodes  will  probably  occur  in  the  financial 
markets. 
Now let me turn to our Financial Stability Report (IEF). 
Financial Stability Report 
Our  Financial  Stability  Report  is  released  in  June  and  December  of  each  year,  containing 
recent macroeconomic and financial developments that might affect the Chilean economy’s 
financial stability. 
This Report’s external scenario includes the same risks I just described when examining the 
Monetary Policy Report, particularly with respect to the US monetary policy and the evolution 
of the Chinese economy. In the Financial Stability Report we also present the Brexit-related 
risks, as well as the difficulties of European banks to resolve their non-performing portfolio 
problems  –  legacy  of  the  global  financial  crisis  –  in  a  scenario  of  weaker  world  growth 
estimates  and  the  global  banking  industry  adapting  to  new  regulatory  standards.  Most 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  recently,  this  scenario  has  become  more  complex  because  of  banks’  profitability  being 
threatened by low interest rates. 
Another  risk  we  need  to  monitor  in  the  coming  months  has  to  do  with  the  prices  of 
commodities and their possible impact on the countries exporting them. Although lately these 
prices have tended to stabilize, they are still lower than they were only a few years back and 
might endanger the fiscal revenues of some economies. In this context, various risk-rating 
agencies  have  downgraded  the  sovereign  ratings  of  oil  exporting  countries,  and  further 
revisions for other commodity exporters – Chile included – cannot be ruled out. Our rating 
being unchanged is certainly good news, but let’s not forget that this is a dynamic process 
and we must never let go. The risk exists and it is up to our own policies to mitigate it. 
On the domestic front, as I just said, local interest rates are low from a historical perspective, 
reflecting monetary policy and external financial conditions. Thus, the downsloping trend of 
long-term rates continues to encourage investment in medium- and long-term mutual funds, 
which  have  reached  high  stock  volumes.  Accordingly,  a  significant  increase  in  long-term 
interest rates poses the risk of these agents becoming a magnifying channel if they react by 
hastily selling off the assets in their portfolios. 
As  for  the  financial  situation  of  companies,  diverse  indicators  confirm  the  weakening 
described  in  previous  Reports.  As  of  the  first  quarter  of  this  year,  the  debt-to-GDP  ratio 
remained near 120 percent, which is relatively high compared to other emerging economies, 
although at the margin it has stabilized and even declined a little (figure 11). 
The  financial  indicators  of  companies  reporting  to  the  Superintendency  of  Securities  and 
Insurance  (SVS)  presented  no  big  changes  at  the  close  of  2015.  However,  by  historical 
patterns, the debt level is high and profits are low. Still, exchange rate mismatch indicators 
continue to show a limited exchange rate risk (figure 12). 
The  real-estate  sector  is  adjusting  after  being  very  dynamic  in  2015.  New  house  sales  in 
Santiago fell sharply in the first quarter of 2016, largely due to advanced purchases last year 
(figure 13). 
A  substantial  part  of  the  sales  of  last  year  were  accounted  for  by  promised  purchases  of 
unfinished units, scheduled for delivery mainly this and next year. In this sense, one risk for 
real-estate companies stems from such promises not being honored if the economic outlook 
worsens.  Finally,  the  vacancy  rate  in  the  office-space  sector  is  around  10  percent,  while 
rental prices showed a slight reduction at the end of 2015. 
In this context, the new house price index for Santiago as estimated by the Chilean Chamber 
of Construction rose 6.8 percent in real annual terms in the first quarter of 2016, slightly less 
than the 7.2 percent it showed in the third quarter of 2015. Meanwhile, in the third quarter of 
last year, the house price index for both new and used units calculated at the Bank rose by 
9.4  and  9.7  percent  in  real  terms  nationwide  and  in  the  Santiago  Metropolitan  Region, 
respectively (figure 14). 
About households, aggregate borrowing – the debt to income ratio, RDI – continues to rise, 
in a context of weaker output and employment. The RDI reached 63 percent at the close of 
2015, largely explained by an increased share of mortgage debt, which continues to expand 
at  a  real  annual  rate  of  nearly  10  percent.  The  aggregate  financial  burden  stands  at  15 
percent of the sector’s disposable income (figure 15). 
Although non-performing indicators for bank consumer credits remain low,  lately there has 
been  some  increase  in  the  case  of  smaller  amount  loans.  Here  the  risk  arises  of  a  more 
drastic  deterioration  of  the  labor  market  that  could  hinder  the  households’  repayment 
capacity. Any developments on this front will need to be closely monitored over the coming 
quarters. 
As for the banks’ lending activity, it is evolving in line with the state of the business cycle. 
Real growth in commercial loans is in line with lower demand for credit by firms, consistently 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 5 
  with  the  reduction  in  investment  and  the  results  of  our  Bank  Lending  Survey.  Consumer 
credit  growth  recovered  slightly  and  mortgage  loans  are  still  growing  strongly,  around  10 
percent  in  real  annual  terms.  Thus,  the  real  annual  growth  rate  of  total  banking  credit  is 
around 5 percent. At the same time, aggregate default indicators are stable, despite some 
deterioration in commercial loans. 
As we pointed out in the last Financial Stability Report, our banking system’s capitalization 
levels  have  decreased  in  recent  years.  At  the  closing  of  2015,  the  capital  adequacy  ratio 
(CAR)  was  12.6  percent.  Although  the  announced  capitalizations  and  accounting  changes 
will push this indicator slightly above 13 percent, a declining dynamic has been observed in 
the past five years. This contrasts with the international trend, where banks have increased 
capitalization in several jurisdictions. Thus, in an OECD comparison, Chile is in the lower part 
of this ratio’s distribution (figure 16). 
Although the current capital levels are sufficient to absorb a possible severe stress scenario, 
gaps have narrowed. While every bank’s CAR exceeds the 8-percent regulatory minimum in 
the stress scenario, the share of banks having a CAR above 10 percent in such a scenario 
has  dropped  in  recent  years,  to  less  than  half  the  system’s  assets  in  the  latest  test 
(figure 17). 
Let me conclude with some final thoughts. 
Concluding thoughts 
In the past several months the macroeconomic scenario has brought no big surprises, but 
that does not mean that challenges have been absent. 
Inflation has dropped in line with expectations, but remains above the tolerance range. Our 
projections  indicate  that  in  a  few  more  months  it  will  return  to  that  range  to  then  decline 
towards the 3-percent target. If this is so, we will have ended quite a long period during which 
inflation  was  at  or  above  4  percent  and  monetary  policy-making  has  been  particularly 
complex,  as  we  have  had  to  deal  with  a  significant  depreciation  of  our  currency  and  the 
ensuing rise in prices, aside from the economic slowdown. Still we have been able to keep 
inflation expectations over the projection horizon well anchored to the 3-percent target. 
In  the  short  term,  there  are  obvious  inflationary  risks,  which  could  again  push  back  this 
convergence. As we have said time and again, the short-term evolution of the exchange rate 
is a very important determinant of the behavior of inflation, and therefore short-term inflation 
will  be  affected  if  some  of  the  external  risks  we  have  identified  in  our  Reports  come  true, 
namely: a trajectory for the fed funds rate well above what the market expects and a sharper 
deceleration  of  the  Chinese  economy  which  would  hit  the  copper  price.  The  medium-term 
impact  of  these  events  is  harder  to  predict,  and  will  depend  on  both  the  persistence  of 
exchange  rate  movements  and  their  effects  on  output.  The  medium-term  effects  are,  no 
doubt  about  it,  more  important  for  monetary  policy,  because  our  policy  framework  defines 
short-term inflation deviations as tolerable, as long as projected inflation two years out does 
not  depart  from  the  3-percent  target.  This  approach  is  what  allows  us  to  keep  inflation 
expectations well anchored while applying a counter-cyclical policy stance in situations like 
the present one. 
Not  denying  the  importance  of  this,  I  must  say  that  the  greatest  challenge  facing  our 
economy is growth. In our baseline scenario, 2017 will be the fourth year in a row with annual 
growth around 2 percent, which is far from satisfactory. However, our scenario also assumes 
that towards the end of next year the country will be approaching potential growth, which we 
estimate  between  3  and  3.5  percent.  This  growth  trajectory  leans  on  three  fundamental 
premises: 
First,  the  impulse  we  are  receiving  from  abroad,  although  milder  than  we  could  have 
foreseen some years back, is not particularly low. Of course we would rather live in a world 
of  higher  copper  prices  and  two-digit  growth  in  China.  But  in  hindsight,  that  was  clearly 
6 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  unsustainable in time. Nevertheless, the world growth figures we see today and project for 
the next two years, do not differ much from what we saw in 2015. The terms of trade should 
tend to stabilize towards 2017 and external financial conditions are good by historic patterns. 
Surely we face risks, but don’t we always. 
Second,  from  a  macroeconomic  standpoint,  our  economy  is  well  balanced.  The  external 
accounts  are  in  good  order,  our  fiscal  policy  is  sound,  inflation  expectations  remain  well 
anchored  and,  beyond  the  importance  of  mitigating  the  risks  identified  in  the  Financial 
Stability Report, local financial markets are well equipped to contribute to that recovery. 
The third premise is the return of confidence. On this point let me digress. It is not a good 
sign  for  a  goal  of  3.5  percent  growth  to  seem  so  elusive.  Just  a  couple  of  years  ago  we 
believed  that  growth  between  4.5  and  5  percent  was  possible.  After  all,  in  the  last  thirty 
years,  the  Chilean  economy  grew  by  an  average  of  5.2  percent  annually.  Certainly  many 
things have happened in the last thirty years that can explain this. 
On  one  hand,  there  is  the  so-called  “convergence”  in  economic  growth.  I  mean,  countries 
with  a  higher  per-capita  income  grow  less  on  average  than  poorer  countries,  because the 
richer  ones  have  more  capital  and  are  closer  to  the  technological  frontier,  so  they  find  it 
harder  to  sustain  high  growth  rates.  Therefore,  it  is  only  natural  for  a  country  that  has 
achieved  the  level  of  development  Chile  has  to  grow  at  a  slower  pace  than  it  did  three 
decades ago. 
On the other hand are some more specific elements, like the end of the boom in commodity 
prices and mining investment. Also that the world is no longer what it was during that boom, 
and us being a small, open economy are touched by that. All of it affects and is consistent 
with our vision of lowering our trend growth to 3.5 percent. 
But,  why  are  we  having  such  trouble  in  achieving  that  level  of  growth?  There  are  two  – 
related – essential elements behind, where we are in debt: investment and productivity. If we 
cannot  ensure  stronger  growth  in  investment,  our  projections  of  economic  recovery  will 
hardly  be  met  and  the  labor  market  will  deteriorate  further.  Obviously  capital  is  a  major 
production factor which by itself has significant effects. But not only that, investment is critical 
for us to be able to achieve productivity growth rates of close to 1 percent in our non-mining 
sectors, an essential element in our trend growth forecast. 
Without investment, technology becomes gradually obsolete and, very importantly, the kind 
of shock that has hit the Chilean economy in recent years requires us to reallocate resources 
from  sectors  that  were  very  attractive  in  the  past  to  others  that  must  now  pull  the  growth 
wagon,  especially  non-traditional  exports.  But  this  reallocation,  which  according  to  our 
research is an important source of productivity growth, can only be achieved if at the same 
time there is investment in these new sectors. Thus, both factors are clearly related to each 
other. 
The question we must all ask ourselves is, if we have done enough to promote these factors. 
I  believe  that  the  productivity  agenda  that  was  agreed  on  by  different  agents  is  a  good 
starting point that must be deepened and carried forward. But we must also bear in mind that 
the loss in confidence affecting the country today, beyond specific causes, puts a brake to 
investment. Remember, our baseline scenario assumes that confidence will recover. 
As for monetary policy, it has done its bit, interest rates are today among the lowest ever and 
will remain expansionary throughout the projection horizon. Monetary policy can help smooth 
the business cycle and that has been our task, successfully I may add. However, the sources 
of countries’ long-term growth are in other areas of the economy that are clearly beyond the 
reach of monetary policy. 
It is important for us to understand, agree on and implement whatever is needed to take the 
leap towards being a more just developed country. We must not forget that our region has 
had  failed  experiences  before.  Countries  that  had  all  the  conditions  to  become  developed 
didn’t make it, and froze their economies exactly at that crucial moment. Today Chile is in a 
BIS central bankers’ speeches
