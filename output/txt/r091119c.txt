José De Gregorio: What happened and where are we headed? 
Speech  by  Mr  José  De  Gregorio,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  at  the  meeting 
Visión  Económica  y  Empresarial  2009-2010,  organized  by  SOFOFA  and  Universidad  del 
Desarrollo, Santiago, 23 October 2009. 
 I thank the federation of Chilean industry SOFOFA and Universidad del Desarrollo for inviting 
me once again to take part in this important annual event. 
When I was preparing this presentation, I realized I had two choices: one was to analyze the 
current situation in light of our latest Monetary Policy Report, which I already did in another 
public seminar and that may overlap other presentations you will hear today. The other was 
to take a longer perspective and examine how we came to where we stand today, how we 
sailed through the troubled waters of the world economy and where we are headed. I think 
this is the perfect audience to take this second option. 
To begin with, it is important to bear in mind that the Central Bank of Chile (CBC) complies 
with  its  mandate  of  safeguarding  price  stability  via  a  monetary  policy  based  on  a  flexible 
inflation  targeting  regime.  The  objective  is  to  keep  annual inflation  around  3%  most  of  the 
time. When deviations occur, monetary policy focuses on correcting them over a period of 
two  years.  In  practice,  in  our  discussions  we  estimate  a  path  for  the  interest  rate  that  is 
consistent with the inflation forecast 24 months ahead converging to the target. This is done 
both because we recognize the lags with which monetary policy operates, and because of 
our concern about the costs in terms of output loss and employment of adjusting inflation to 
the target. If we do not do this, the adjustment would take much less time to complete. 
All this is common knowledge. But I feel it needs to be stressed in order to clear, yet one 
more  time,  the  mistaken  argument  that  the  CBC  does  not  consider  the  level  of  economic 
activity when making its decisions. Additionally it serves to insist on the issue that the current 
global financial crisis was not caused – as some argue – by monetary policy’s orientation to 
price stability, but by a tremendous failure in the financial systems of the developed world. 
Neither  the  private  sector  nor  policymakers  were  able  to  foresee  the  danger  of  the 
imbalances  that  were  accumulating  during  this  decade.  Today,  the  monetary  and  fiscal 
stimulus packages are precisely what have allowed the world economy, which suffered an 
initial  shock  similar  to  that  of  the  Great  Depression,  to  show  a  substantially  better 
performance. This is particularly true in the case of Chile. 
The evolution of the economy and monetary policy from 2007 onwards 
In just three years, the Chilean economy has gone through two radically different episodes, 
although related to one another. From a significant inflationary shock caused by the rise in oil 
and food prices to the effects of an unprecedented international financial crisis accompanied 
by a drop in output and a sharp reduction in inflation. 
Since  mid-2007,  the  Chilean  economy  went  through  a  process  of  significant  increase  in 
inflation, due to the sharp rise in commodity prices in world markets (figure 1). This rise was 
caused  by  supply  and  demand  factors  specific  to  those  markets.  Therefore,  it  was  an 
adjustment of relative prices in foreign markets and not a generalized increase in domestic 
prices. 
The fact that it was an adjustment of relative prices made us not act with the strength that we 
would have if, for example, it had been a widespread increase in prices caused by a demand 
shock.  In  fact,  the  purpose  of  the  increases  in  the  monetary  policy  rate  (MPR)  applied  in 
2007  and  early  2008  were  to  avoid  the  incubation  of  undesired  second-round  effects  that 
BIS Review 145/2009

might  unreasonably  prolong  the  inflationary  impact  of  the  shocks.  Also,  in  that  period  we 
decided to begin a process of reserve accumulation consistent with the prevailing financial 
uncertainty and the evolution of the exchange rate.  
As from May of last year, the macroeconomic picture changed. Inflation rates began to show 
a  fast  and  unexpected  propagation  of  these  shocks  to  other  prices  (figure  2).  It  could  be 
argued that the Bank reacted too late. However it is worth recalling that when this massive 
inflation  propagation  began,  private  agents  were  expecting  4.4%  for  December  2008 
inflation, while May’s Monetary Policy Report placed it at 4.7%. The actual figure was 7.1%, 
with a peak in October of 9.9%. 
The  inflationary  upsurge  certainly  took  everybody  by  surprise,  coinciding  with  peaking  oil 
prices. Chile was, at the same time, one of the countries where inflation rose fastest during 
the  episodes  of  increasing  commodity  prices  and  also  where  inflation  dropped  fastest 
afterwards (figure 3). 
Why was that? We know it was not because of changes in the traditional variables, such as 
the evolution of economic activity or the exchange rate. The speed of the adjustments may 
be explained by us being an open, market economy, with few price distortions. The rise in 
the oil price may have also created the perception that the increase would be very persistent, 
accelerating  the  adjustment  of  local  prices.  However,  beyond  the  need  to  deepen  our 
understanding  of  inflationary  dynamics,  what  counts  here  is  the  capacity  to  react  and  the 
flexibility  of  monetary  policy,  two  characteristics  that  it  exhibited  in  its  response  to  this 
phenomenon. 
In our May Report of last year, when the MPR was at 6.25%, we announced that in the most 
likely scenario the path of the MPR would be in line with market expectations, that showed a 
further increase of at most 25 basis points in the next twelve months. 
Things changed and, naturally, monetary policy decisions changed as well. In four meetings 
we raised the MPR by 200 basis points, to 8.25%. The purpose was to limit the propagation 
effects, via reducing the demand through a more restrictive monetary policy. Just as we then 
stated, although a deceleration of global growth was expected, we did not see that it would 
have  the  necessary  force  to  contain  inflation  and  therefore  monetary  policy  had  to  be 
tightened. 
As a matter of fact, our Report of September 2008, before the economic plunge and when 
Consensus Forecasts estimated 2.6% growth for the world this year, we announced that the 
MPR would probably be raised above 9%. But the world changed again, and very strongly. 
What at first seemed just as a deceleration of global activity, resulted being the first drop in 
world growth in over sixty years (figure 4). 
This led to a change in policies with no precedent in Chile’s monetary history. The drop in 
world  demand  would  result  in  a  larger  slowdown  in  domestic  demand  than  the  one  we 
intended  to  cause  via  monetary  policy.  In  this  new  setting,  the  obvious  reaction  was  to 
change the sign of monetary policy. 
The first important signal was revising our projections – in November 2008 – and announcing 
that  the  increases  that  had  been  forecast  in  September  would  not  occur.  Such  an 
announcement had an immediate impact on financial conditions. This way, the CBC initiated 
the most aggressive interest rate cut ever implemented in Chile, and one of the sharpest in 
the world (figure 5). 
Likewise,  in  September  and  October  2008,  at  the  peak  of  the  world  financial  crisis,  the 
spreads of the peso and dollar rates increased significantly. In scenarios of financial stress, it 
is imperative to align market rates with the MPR, because the latter may cease to act as a 
benchmark for the financial system. Therefore, the first actions we took were to provide the 
necessary liquidity and  ensure that the financial system could continue operating as usual 
(figure 6).

 BIS Review 145/2009
The  timing  of  the  interest  rate  cut  can  be  subject  to  debate.  It  is  possible  that,  with  the 
information we have today, we could have done it sooner. But I  must insist that monetary 
policy  decisions  are  made  with  the  information  available  at  each  moment  in  time,  so  it  is 
useful to refresh some facts. 
In December 2008, we entered the monetary policy meeting with an annual inflation rate of 
8.9%. The market expected the MPR to be at 6.25% and annual inflation to be at 3.9% by 
December  2009.  Thus,  despite  the  downward  bias  of  monetary  policy,  the  MPR  was  not 
reduced  until  January,  and  began  a  process  rate  cuts  with  a  speed  and  magnitude 
unexpected by the market (table 1). 
This is how, after accumulating signals that the inflation phenomenon had ended and was 
strongly reversing, we began reducing the MPR, and we did it with vigor, taking it to the level 
we  believe  is  the  minimum  it  can  take  without  jeopardizing  the  normal  functioning  of  the 
money market. 
But this cut did not exhaust our monetary policy tools. In July we took additional measures to 
make monetary policy still more expansionary. 
Beyond adopting the commitment that we still keep, of holding the MPR at its minimum level 
for  a  prolonged  period  of  time,  we  made  it  explicit  by  creating  a  time  liquidity  facility,  the 
“FLAP.”  This  was  meant  to  ascertain  to  the  market  that  they  would  be  able  to  obtain 
resources at a rate equivalent to the MPR for three- and six-month terms, and thus generate 
an interest rate structure that would allow a faster and stronger transmission of the monetary 
stance  to  market  interest  rates.  The  success  of  these  measures  is  tangible  proof  of  the 
diversity of monetary policy tools at the Bank’s disposal as well as of its commitment with 
meeting the inflation target. 
The global crisis and the weakening of economic activity 
The effects of the global crisis in Chile, on both the financial and the trade sectors, do not 
reflect  its  full  impact  on  the  domestic  economy.  The  increase  in  risk  premiums  and  the 
tensions in the world financial markets last year tightened local financial conditions, with a 
direct  effect  on  the  demand.  Although  at  some  point  every  country  feared  a  generalized 
shutdown  of  international  financial  markets,  Chile  maintained  its  normal  access  and  the 
direct financial impact was milder (figure 7). 
On  the  trade  side,  Chile  has  seen  a  drop  in  export  prices,  whose  greatest  effect  can  be 
observed in disposable income, which affects the demand, although the effects of the lower 
copper  price  are  offset  by  the  fiscal  rule.  Nonetheless,  because  the  Chilean  economy  is 
primarily an exporter of commodity-related products, the effects of the drop in world activity 
were  smaller  than  on  exporters  of  manufactured  goods.  This  is  because  the  demand  for 
manufactures  has  been  the  hardest  hit  by  the  global  recession.  In  our  case,  prices  have 
fallen,  but  it  has  been  always  possible  to  sell  our  products.  On  the  other  hand,  in 
manufactures  exporting  countries,  purchase  orders  came  to  a  sudden  halt,  giving  way  to 
inventory build-up and a severe drop in production. This explains the magnitude of the initial 
fall in many Asian and industrialized economies. 
Overall,  it  is  interesting  to  note  that  an  essentially  healthy  economy  like  Chile  was  hit 
surprisingly fast by the international crisis. Here we must underscore that the effects of the 
global  crisis  had  an  unprecedented  degree  of  synchrony.  Roughly  90%  of  the  world’s 
countries posted a contraction of output the fourth quarter of last year. 
The culprit of the deteriorated economic activity, in my opinion, was the confidence crisis that 
took over the whole world, Chile included. Uncertainty multiplied. There was genuine concern 
that the financial systems of developed economies might paralyze completely and that the 
economic  meltdown  would  trigger  a  much  deeper  recession  than  the  one  we  see  today. 
Households and firms reduced their expenditures in preparation for a possible catastrophe, 
BIS Review 145/2009

causing  a  much  larger  drop  in  demand  than  would  have  occurred  without  the  crisis  of 
expectations.  In  hindsight,  you  can  say  that  we  overreacted,  because  the  catastrophic 
scenario did not materialize. But the loss of confidence had a real foundation, both because 
of  the  deteriorated  global  macroeconomic  and  financial  conditions  and  because  we  were 
enduring the deepest crisis ever. 
In this context, there was also the uncertainty about how and how effectively policies would 
operate, which has faded thanks to the determination of central banks and finance ministries 
in the larger part of the world. In our case, the quick reaction of macroeconomic policies has 
been essential in mitigating the impact of the external crisis. 
Although  our  GDP  will  fall  this  year,  the  performance  of  our  economy,  from  a  historic 
perspective, has been remarkable. In 1982 and 1983, the Chilean economy grew nearly 18 
percentage  points  lower  than  the  world’s  average.  In  1998  and  1999,  this  difference  was 
around 4 percentage points. In 2009, estimations point at the drop in output in Chile similar to 
the world’s average (figure 8). 
Monetary policy can do little to avoid the immediate effects of this kind of confidence crisis. 
However, policies do play an essential role in preventing these crises from aggravating, and 
they provide the grounds for the recovery of expectations. To that end it is necessary to act 
in  a  timely  manner  and  with  conviction.  Any  hasty  behavior,  or,  on  the  contrary,  being 
complacent and ignoring the severity of the crisis, could have eroded the effectiveness of the 
policies and deepened the recession. 
There will be plenty of time to analyze the phenomena that deepened the crisis, but what is 
clear  is  that  the  confidence  crisis  exacerbated  the  effects  of  the  world  turmoil  on  global 
economic activity. The upside is that the reaction of policies and the responses of firms have 
set us on the right foot for the recovery of the local economy. The adjustment of demand has 
put  households  and  firms  in  a  healthy  financial  position  to  resume  demand  growth.  The 
various  indicators  of  demand,  expectations  and  production  suggest  that  the  Chilean 
economy has begun the process of recovery we foresaw for this half. The monthly index of 
economic  activity,  Imacec,  seasonally  adjusted,  has  been  rising  since  May  and  the 
unemployment rate, which at some point was thought to be headed to exceeding 12%, has 
stabilized under 11%. Also, monetary policy will continue to be expansionary for a prolonged 
period  of  time  and,  as  we  stated  in  our  last  Report,  in  the  most  likely  scenario,  the  slow 
withdrawal of the monetary stimulus will begin during the second quarter of next year.  
Meanwhile, the Chilean peso has remained somewhat more depreciated that the currencies 
of  other  commodity  exporters.  There  are  several  hypotheses  to  explain  this,  including  the 
effect of the monetary policy stance. Anyhow, the real exchange rate is currently at levels 
believed to be consistent with its long-term fundamentals (figure 9). Accordingly, in a context 
of  high  uncertainty  about  the  evolution  of  global  exchange  rates,  the  CBC  will  continue 
monitoring the impact of the exchange rate path on expected inflation in its monetary policy 
decisions. 
In  this  scenario,  annual  inflation  will  be  in  negative  territory  for  some  months,  to  gradually 
converge to 3% toward 2011, while the economy will grow between 4.5% and 5.5% in 2010 
(table  2).  This  scenario  is  consistent  with  a  gradual  closing  of  output  gaps,  a  necessary 
condition for inflation to return to 3%. If we consider that trend GDP growth will be in the 4%-
4.5% range in 2010, a figure estimated by the CBC and consistent with the opinions of the 
committee of experts that perform the estimation for the design of the budget, such a range 
seems not excessive but rather moderate to close the output gap. If growth falls short, the 
economy will not close the gaps and, therefore, inflation will continue dropping or will adjust 
at a much slower pace, which obviously would require a stronger monetary impulse.

Final remarks 
We  have  suffered  the  worst  financial-economic  crisis  in  many  years.  The  strength  of  the 
Chilean  economy,  rigorously  built  over  a  long  time  period,  has  allowed  us  to  mitigate  the 
costs of a crisis that in the past would have impacted us much harder. The lessons about the 
need to maintain a solid financial system and the capacity to apply countercyclical policies 
have been critical in this performance. At the same time, they serve as a solid foundation for 
a steady recovery. There are many tasks ahead of us, in particular to reinforce Chile’s growth 
capacity, but our macroeconomic fundamentals are consolidated. 
However, the horizon is not completely clear. Although risks are more limited than they were 
a  few  quarters  ago,  vulnerabilities  remain.  The  financial  systems  of  developed  economies 
remain  weak.  World  growth  forecasts  point  to  a  slow  recovery  and  the  world  will  hardly 
regain  the  growth  rates  of  2006-2007  in  the  coming  years.  A  proper  conduct  of  economic 
policies should provide the support for such recovery. 
Adding to the problems still present in the financial systems and the level of private sector 
indebtedness, the fiscal situation of many industrialized economies, which met the crisis with 
already  fragile  positions,  leaves  several  questions  open.  Global  imbalances  are  not  a 
problem  today,  because  the  drop  in  demand  has  taken  part  of  the  adjustment,  but  as  the 
world  economy  picks  up  they  could  become  a  threat  again.  Finally,  we  have  seen  an 
optimistic attitude in international stock exchanges. They anticipate a healthy recovery, but if 
wrong they might result in asset revaluations that could pave the way for new uncertainties. 
The role of the Central Bank of Chile is to monitor all these risks and their implications on the 
monetary  stance,  in  order  to  regulate  it  in  consistency  with  its  inflationary  objective.  We 
remain at a stage where making projections is a complex task, but the scenario for output, 
inflation and monetary policy path we presented in our last Report remains in force. 
Although private forecasts already recognize that the worst is over, it is still too soon to say 
that  the  work  is  complete.  Output  gaps  are  wide  and  we  face  the  challenge  of  bringing 
inflation  back  to  the  target.  Markets  are  incorporating  a  faster  withdrawal  of  the  monetary 
stimulus than the Bank considers appropriate for the purposes of meeting the inflation target. 
Particularly  now  that,  as  in  the  rest  of  the  world,  fiscal  policy  is  entering  a  consolidation 
phase,  monetary  policy  will  have  to  continue  providing  the  necessary  stimulus  to  the 
economy  for  a  prolonged  period  of  time.  This,  in  order  for  the  recovery  of  output  and  the 
normalization of inflationary expectations to be well entrenched. One lesson from past crises 
is  that  a  premature  withdrawal  can  be  very  costly  and  can  lead  to  subsequent  policy 
reversals. 
Thank you very much.
