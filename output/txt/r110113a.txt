José De Gregorio: The Central Bank of Chile’s financial stability and 
monetary policy 
Speech by Mr José De Gregorio, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, before the Senate at 
the  presentation  of 
financial  stability  and  monetary  policy  report,  Valparaíso, 
20 December 2010. 
the 
 Introduction 
Mr. President of the Finance Committee, senator Camilo Escalona, honorable senators, 
I am grateful for the Committee’s invitation to the Board of the Central Bank of Chile to share 
our  vision  on  recent  macroeconomic  and  financial  developments,  their  outlook  and 
implications for monetary policy. They make up the content of our  Monetary Policy Report 
(IPoM) of December 2010 and our Financial Stability Report (IEF) for the second-half 2010. 
When we presented our third IPoM of the year last September, we said that expansionary 
policies  applied  during  2009  had  borne  fruit  and  set  the  ground  for  sound  growth  in  the 
Chilean economy. Today, we see that as a result our country will grow by around 5.2% this 
year, despite the effects of the earthquake and tsunami of last February. Also, prospects for 
2011 are favorable, with projected growth in the range of 5.5 to 6.5%.  
Inflation has approached the 3% target, but more gradually than foreseen. In this behavior 
there  have  been  transitory  factors  related  with  the  peso  appreciation  since  mid-year.  Our 
projections  are  consistent  with  inflation  hovering  around  the  3%  target  during  the  next 
24 months. 
Chile  is  facing  an  unusual  international  scenario.  On  the  one  hand,  the  recovery  of 
developed  economies  goes  on,  but  only  moderately  and  insufficiently  to  reduce  the  high 
rates of unemployment (figure 1). Risks are substantial. In fact, the intensity and velocity of 
the  events  we  saw  in  Europe  in  early  November  are  proof  of  the  fragility  of  the  world 
economy.  On  the  other  hand,  growth  prospects  in  emerging  markets  are  still  positive; 
commodity  prices  are  still  high,  with  copper  standing  out  recently  at  record  highs,  and 
external financing conditions are good. The sustainability of this imbalanced scenario for the 
global economy is one of the primary risk factors for next year. Some of the questions we 
must try to answer and monitor closely are: How fast can emerging economies grow if the 
advanced  economies  are  further  weakened?  How  can  advanced  economies  grow  without 
incurring in unsustainable current-account deficits? How will the financial tensions in Europe 
be  resolved?  Is  it  possible  for  expenditure  in  Chile  to  grow  excessively  while  ignoring  the 
risks coming from abroad? 
In this context, the Board has continued to gradually normalize the monetary policy interest 
rate (MPR), setting it at 3.25% in its December meeting. In the most likely scenario, it will 
continue to gradually withdraw the monetary stimulus, which will depend on the unfolding of 
internal and external macroeconomic conditions.  
Let me now take a closer look at the scenario we believe is the most likely for the next two 
years and its implications for inflation and monetary policy.  
Macroeconomic scenario 
I will begin with the world economy.  
After the global recession of 2009, the recovery has been imbalanced between developed 
and  emerging  economies.  Among  developed  ones,  especially  those  that  encountered 
problems in their financial systems during the crisis, are growing below trend.

Thus, the main developed economies are still enduring high unemployment rates. Stimulus 
measures adopted during the recession helped the world economy to begin recovering. But 
private demand remains weak in the advanced world and inflation, both headline and core, is 
still contained. Households, banks and governments in the main developed economies are 
facing  a  fragile  financial  situation.  Within  this  context,  the  process  of  de-leveraging  and 
restoring the damaged balance sheets will take some time.  
Such  a  scenario  has  called  for  additional  monetary  expansion  measures  and  postponing 
interest rate normalization in those economies. The dollar has depreciated in global markets 
(figure  2)  while  in  the  U.S.,  additional  fiscal  stimulus  packages  have  been  adopted  and  in 
Europe fiscal adjustment plans are being applied.  
In  emerging  markets,  especially  in  Asia  and  Latin  America,  economic  activity  has  been 
growing  strongly,  although  it  is  expected  to  converge  to  trend  levels  during  2011.  As  a 
response  to  this  and  to  signs  of  increased  inflation,  emerging  economies  are  gradually 
withdrawing their fiscal and monetary stimulus packages. Differences in the growth outlook, 
risk perceptions and interest rates have created conditions that favor capital flows towards 
these economies (figure 3). 
Commodity  prices  remain  high  by  historic  standards,  consistently  with  the  strength  of 
emerging economies, some specific supply-side elements and the depreciation of the dollar. 
Worth noting are the recent sharp increases in the international prices of some foodstuffs and 
the copper price peaking at US$4.2 per pound (figure 4).  
The  baseline  scenario  in  the  IPoM  we  are  presenting  today  assumes  that  some  of  these 
factors will persist over the projection scenario. In the case of copper, even if it will not be as 
high as today, it will exceed September’s projections, at US$3.3 and US$3.2 per pound in 
2011  and  2012,  respectively.  The  price  outlook  for  WTI  oil  is  also  revised  up  from 
September, to US$89 per barrel in the two years.  
The baseline scenario for the international economy is good, albeit with important associated 
risks. We expect an average growth rate of 4.2% for the world economy over the next two 
years, fairly high by historic standards, but around 0.3 percentage points below the market 
consensus  forecast.  This  differential  is  based  on  the  effects  of  the  financial  turbulences  in 
Europe, tighter fiscal adjustment plans in the region and the absence of a vigorous recovery 
of  demand  in  developed  economies.  In  addition,  because  of  the  inflationary  pressures 
present in some emerging economies, it is obvious they cannot continue to grow at the same 
pace they did this year (table 1). 
It is worth noting that the Board of the Central Bank of Chile believes that the risk of an even 
weaker performance of the world economy is still latent and is more likely to occur than is a 
more optimistic scenario. A lasting recuperation of the developed world calls for a reduction 
in the current-account deficits accumulated before the crisis. Some advanced economies like 
the U.S. must reduce their trade imbalances, but their possibility of basing growth on their 
external sectors is limited. In the Eurozone, the rigidities associated to the common currency 
slow the exchange rate adjustment inside the region. In China, high savings and exchange 
rate interventions lock the parities’ adjustments.  
At the national level, third-quarter figures for output and demand continued to show strong 
dynamism,  although  with  some  deceleration  compared  with  the  first  half  (figure  5).  In  that 
quarter, GDP rose 7% annually, with a velocity of 8.1%. In aggregate, third-quarter output 
was  in  line  with  the  baseline  scenario  we  had  foreseen  in  September,  but  with  a  different 
composition  both  on  the  output  side  and  on  the  expenditures  side.  From  the  expenditures 
standpoint,  it  is  worth  mentioning  the  moderation  of  the  durable  components  of  demand  
– i.e., purchases of durable goods and investment in machinery & equipment – with respect 
to  indicators  for  the  first  half.  Investment,  although  at  a  slower  pace  than  forecast  in 
September, continued to expand during the third quarter, driven by imports of machinery & 
equipment. Meanwhile, non-durable private consumption outperformed expectations again.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
Among  the  factors  underlying  the  demand  trend  is  the  recovery  from  the  crisis  and  the 
earthquake,  together  with  the  banking  credit  expansion  combined  with  reduced  lending 
spreads,  which  is consistent  with  the  flexibilization  of  lending  standards  as  reported  in  the 
Banking Credit Survey to financial institutions undertaken by the Bank.  
Therefore,  projections  are  that  GDP  will  grow  5.2%  in  2010,  while  demand  will  increase 
16.1% annually, reflecting that output gaps are narrowing and close to exhaustion (figure 6).  
In 2011, domestic demand will continue to drive GDP growth, with a y-o-y increase of 6.6%. 
Consumption and investment will be dynamic, but not as much as in 2010. This trajectory is 
based on still optimistic confidence indicators, a positive labor market, ongoing expansionary 
monetary conditions and a favorable scenario for borrowing (figure 7).  
In addition, next year will see a stronger impact of public and private reconstruction works, 
which  should  be  visible  mainly  in  infrastructure  investment,  in  line  with  a  dynamic 
construction sector. Accordingly, the investment rate will rise next year, to more than 30% of 
GDP  in  real  terms.  Inventory  change,  meanwhile,  will  be  smaller  than  in  2010,  due  to  the 
completion of the inventory replacement process triggered by depletion in late 2008 and the 
earthquake last February. In the case of the public sector, the baseline scenario is consistent 
with provisions in the Budget Law.  
Thus, GDP will grow in the 5.5%–6.5% range in 2011, with a smaller contribution of supply-
side sectors – i.e., fishing, mining and hydroelectric generation – than foreseen in the latest 
IPoM,  while  the  other  sectors  will  converge  to  trend  growth  as  the  monetary  and  external 
impulses are normalized (table 2). 
Prospects for trend growth are similar to September’s, that is, around 5%. In this scenario, 
which also features improved terms of trade, the current account of the balance of payments 
will post a surplus of 0.3% of GDP in 2010, contrasting with the deficit forecast in September, 
owing  mainly  to  better  export  prices.  However,  estimations  yield  that  in  2011  the  current 
account will reach a deficit of 1.4% of GDP.  
Y-o-y headline inflation has remained in the lower zone of the tolerance range, while the core 
measure CPIX1 is still in negative territory. This low core inflation has been partly offset by 
increases in the prices of foodstuffs, both perishable and non-perishable and, most recently, 
by increased fuel prices (figure 8).  
Since last July, there has been a renewed, markedly ascending trend in food prices in the 
global  market.  Given  the  experience  of  2008,  it  has  become  again  cause  for  concern  for 
policy-makers in some countries. As shown in a box in our IPoM, in Chile a little more than 
one percentage point of inflation is due to food prices. Until now, the recovery of margins in 
the aftermath of the crisis has allowed cushioning the local inflationary effects of world price 
increases.  Still,  this  is  an  important  risk  for  inflation,  particularly  because  of  the  potential 
propagation effects it might cause, and it calls for close monitoring and follow-up. 
The CPI will end this year with a variation of 2.8% (table 3). Going forward, the absorption of 
output gaps and increased food prices suggest that annual inflation will stay near the target 
until  the  end  of  the  projection  horizon,  this  time  the  fourth  quarter  of  2012.  The  path  of 
normalization of the CPIX and the CPIX1 will be slower. They are forecast to converge to the 
target only towards the end of next year, to stay there for the remaining part of the projection 
horizon. Market inflation expectations, in line with this scenario, remain at 3% in the medium 
term. However, for the near future reduced inflation figures are foreseen (figure 9).  
In  addition  to  the  already  mentioned  assumptions  about  output  gaps  and  higher  prices  of 
foods and commodities, imported inflationary pressures are assumed to be well contained. 
Also, nominal wages are expected to be adjusted in accordance with the economy’s stage of 
the business cycle and inflation dynamics.  
As I said last Tuesday in my visit to the full Senate, the Chilean peso has been gaining value 
against the dollar since our latest IPoM, although not as strongly as it did between June and 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

September.  In  multilateral  terms,  the  appreciation  has  also  been  smaller,  because  of  the 
dollar’s loss in value with respect to other currencies; even some currencies of Chile’s trading 
partners have shown higher bilateral appreciations than the peso (figure 10). 
Among  the  long-lasting  elements  underlying  this  appreciation,  we  may  highlight  improved 
terms of trade, a better cyclical position of the Chilean economy compared with developed 
ones, the accumulated increase in the ratio of public expenditure to GDP and the reduction in 
our net debtor position relative to the rest of the world.  
In Chile, net capital flows have been limited. We have seen capital inflows as direct foreign 
investment  and  placement  of  bonds  abroad  by  Chilean  firms.  But  at  the  same  time,  these 
inflows  have  been  offset  by  outflows  due  to  higher  investments  abroad  by  residents, 
including pension funds.  
Considering  the  level  of  the  nominal  exchange  rate  and  currency  parities  prevailing  at  the 
statistical  closing  of  this  IPoM,  the  real  exchange  rate  (RER)  is  around  its  minimum 
consistent  with  its  long-term  fundamentals.  The  baseline  scenario  of  this  IPoM  uses  as  a 
working assumption that the peso will post a moderate real depreciation into the long-term.  
Projections also use the assumption that the monetary stimulus will continue to be gradually 
withdrawn  at  a  pace  comparable  to  what  can  be  inferred  from  the  various  expectations 
surveys  (figure  11).  The  Board  hereby  states  that  this  will  depend,  in  any  case,  on  the 
unfolding of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions. 
As  is  usual,  in  our  diagnosis  and  assessment  of  developments  of  the  world  and  local 
economy, we identify the risks whose potential consequences on inflation and output warrant 
special  attention.  These  are  also  the  risk  scenarios  that  we  consider  when  evaluating  the 
resilience of the domestic financial system. 
On  this  occasion,  the  main  concern  in  the  international  outlook  is  global  recovery  being 
slower than foreseen in the baseline scenario, thus producing a milder external impulse for 
the national economy.  
One  of  the  reasons  tilting  the  risk  balance  toward  the  negative  side  are  constraints  facing 
macroeconomic,  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  in  the  main  advanced  economies  to  mitigate 
potentially  negative  trends  in  private  confidence.  These  facts  could  originate  in  the 
persistence or intensification of financial turbulences associated to European countries, or in 
the  application  of  tighter  policies  in  some  emerging  economies  to  avoid  a  resurgence  of 
inflation and/or an overheating of the economy. This entails the risk of the emerging world 
being unable to sustain world growth. In addition, this would have a negative impact on the 
prices of commodities, including copper. Barriers to exchange rate adjustments help amplify 
those effects on world economic activity. 
Regarding inflation, the main risks are associated to pressures coming from higher prices of 
foodstuffs  and/or  other  commodities,  which  could  continue  rising  globally  and  be  more 
intensely transmitted to local prices. Also, it may so happen that local demand and output is 
stronger  than  projected  in  2011,  thus  creating  higher  than  foreseen  inflationary  pressures. 
Finally, labor cost pressures are still latent with tighter conditions in the labor market. 
The materialization of these risks would have direct implications on the inflation and growth 
rates estimated to be the most likely by the Board. Thus, after evaluating all the elements 
described, the Board believes that the risk balance is unbiased for inflation and downward 
biased for output. 
Although the recent financial turbulences have centered mainly in the peripheral countries of 
the  Eurozone,  we  cannot  rule  out  that  they  intensify  and  spread  to  other  economies, 
including  emerging  ones.  In  this  scenario,  in  addition  to  the  slowdown  in  growth  I  just 
commented, there would be the risk of a sharp change in the supply of external capital that 
could  translate  into  higher  costs  or  constraints  in  external  financing  to  Chilean  banks  and 
firms. Therefore, in the present context of abundant supply of external funds, it is important to 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches
safeguard  the  resilience  that  has  characterized  the  Chilean  financial  system  in  the  past 
several years, preventing vulnerabilities to be created as a result of asset price misalignment, 
exchange  rate  mismatches,  excessive  short-term  borrowing  or  unsustainable  increases  in 
credit taken by firms and households. 
So far, none of that has happened. As has been the case since the exchange rate float, and 
despite greater external credit, firms’ mismatches are limited and leveraging is stable. In the 
case of households, borrowing and financial burdens have remained at 2007 levels. Banks, 
meanwhile, show low and stable exchange rate mismatches, and have managed to extend 
the  tenor  of  their  external  debt.  At  the  same  time,  our  reported  stress  tests  show  that  the 
banks’ level of capital allows them to absorb a risk episode like the one just described. 
On the other hand, the main financial prices have generally proceeded in line with short-term 
fundamentals.  For  the  stock  exchange,  the  IEF  reports  results  showing  some  degree  of 
optimism in stock prices with respect to fundamentals. It is necessary to point out that, in the 
case  of  Chile,  the  risks  of  financial  instability  from  potential  price  corrections  in  the  stock 
exchange are low, because the level of debt associated to higher stock prices is small. 
However, it is important not to become too indulgent because of the resilience of the financial 
system.  Credit  users  and  financial  intermediaries  must  internalize  the  risks  I  have  just 
mentioned in their consumption, investment and financing decisions. On its part, the Central 
Bank  permanently  monitors  these  variables  and,  through  instances  such  as  the  Capital 
Market Committee and the Board of Superintendents, coordinates with other institutions to 
watch  over  the  health  of  the  national  financial  system  within  the  framework  of  its  legal 
authorities.  In  this  context,  the  Central  Bank  will  not  hesitate  to  perform  –  or  request  the 
relevant  institutions  –  regulatory  amendments  whenever  it  detects  risks  threatening  the 
financial system.  
To finish, let me share with you some thoughts.  
Final remarks 
After being hit by the Great Recession that swept through the world in 2008 and 2009, the 
Chilean economy has picked up strongly. Expansionary policies applied have paid off. Today 
the challenge is to attain sustainable growth, and, to that end, the Board of the Central Bank 
of Chile will continue to conduct monetary policy to ensure that inflation stands near 3% over 
the two-year policy horizon.  
Despite the favorable outlook, in the international scenario there are still tensions and it is not 
totally clear how the global recovery will proceed. The Central Bank will continue to monitor 
the performance of the world economy to determine its implications on our policy conduct.  
Prospects for the Chilean economy in 2011 are good, but, as I just said, not free of risks. We 
expect  our  economy  to  continue  along  its  strong  growth  trend  during  the  next  24  months, 
boosting increases in income, employment and welfare of our fellow citizens. Our mandate is 
to oversee that this process is sustainable in an environment of price stability and financial 
stability. We will do our best to make it happen, taking every necessary measure. 
Thank you.
