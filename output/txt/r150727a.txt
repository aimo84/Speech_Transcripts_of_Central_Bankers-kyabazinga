  Gent Sejko: Supervisory policies after the start of the Banking Union – 
initial experiences and outlook for CESEE economies 
Intervention by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, in 6th ECB Conference on 
CESEE: “CESEE, old and new policy challenges”, session’s topic “Supervisory policies after 
the  start  of  the  Banking  Union  –  initial  experiences  and  outlook  for  CESEE  economies”, 
Frankfurt am Main, 10 June 2015. 
 Dear participants: 
I  am  honored  and  pleased  to  be  in  this  important  conference  among  distinguished 
professionals of banking and financial industry! I want to start by thanking the organizers for 
the invitation to be here, but also to congratulate the ECB on its new building: I wish it is as 
functional, as it is beautiful! 
Coming  from  the  banking  industry,  I  have  been  feeling  the  impact  on  the  banking  activity 
arising from the changing economic and financial environment due to recent global financial 
crisis. Since my appointment as the new Governor of the Bank of Albania at the beginning of 
this year, I have been seriously estimating the challenges we face in order to maintain the 
stability of our banking sector and ensure that it is fit to play its role in support of Albania’s 
economic growth. 
In my intervention today, I would like to share with you how we see the impact of changes in 
the financial landscape, including those in supervision superstructure, on the financial system 
of CESEE countries and more specifically on Albania’s one. 
With  that  being  said,  please  let  me  start  with  supervision  superstructure  and  the 
relevant changes in the post-crisis financial landscape, on the first place. 
Since the beginning of the global financial crisis, there have been significant changes in the 
financial landscape. These changes have been driven by a combination of: 
1) 
2) 
3) 
pre-crisis excesses; 
restructuring measures; 
international financial regulatory reforms; 
Pre-crisis excesses were due to: 
• 
• 
• 
increasing financial integration and innovation; 
misalignments between incentives for risk-taking and risk-provision; 
weaknesses  in  monitoring  and  supervision  (especially  lack  of  monitoring  and 
assessment  of  systemic  risk  development,  as  well  as  cross-border  interaction 
issues); 
Such pre-crisis excesses led to risks coming from: 
• 
higher  (and  often,  hidden)  concentration  of  exposures  and  interconnection, 
especially on a cross-border level; 
over-indebtedness (both in private and public sectors); 
unrealistic increase in both, financial and real asset prices; 
• 
• 
Hence,  restructuring  measures  were  necessary  to  address  inherent  risks  in  the  financial 
institutions, which were coming from:

  high leverage; 
falling asset quality; 
funding constraints; 
insufficient capitalization; 
fragmentation and conflicts of interest in supervision; 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Such  measures  were  associated  with  public  intervention  in  the  financial  system  (mostly 
banks),  increasing  further  the  linkage  between  “banks  and  sovereigns”  and  creating  more 
“moral  hazard”.  At  this  point,  a  financial  regulatory  reform  was  necessary  at  international 
level, to address such risks. 
Under the guidance of the G20, broader and more comprehensive regulatory reforms were 
designed,  with  a  special  contribution  by  Basel  Committee,  the  Financial  Stability  Board, 
IMF/WB group and many other. Such reforms were aiming to: 
• 
• 
In more details, such reforms included: 
• 
– 
Improving the surveillance superstructure of the financial system, through: 
establishing  institutions  with  macro-prudential  powers  to  monitor,  assess  and 
address systemic risk (in EU – ESRB, ECB; in US – FSOC; in UK – FPC; etc.); 
reducing fragmentation and possible conflicts of interest in supervision, and achieve 
supervision  consistency:  notably 
the  “Banking  Union/Single 
Supervisory Mechanism”: ECB – EBA – ESRB; in UK – BoE – PRA – FPC; 
new  directives  to  ensure  timing  and  effective  restructuring  of  banking  business 
(BRRD); 
better design and use of tools to assess resilience of financial institutions to risks, 
like stress-testing (in EU – EBA/ECB); 
strengthen the resilience of the financial system; 
avoid future similar crisis; 
through 
in  EU 
Improving the financial system infrastructure, through: 
better  protecting  the  “core”  banking  activity  from  other  activities  like  “proprietary 
investment” through new rules and proposals (in US – the “Volcker” rule; in UK – 
proposals of the “Vickers” Commission; in EU – proposals in “Liikanen” report); 
improving  clearing  and  settlement  of  securities  transactions  and  streamlining 
financial reporting; 
improving deposit guarantee schemes 
      Improving in banks under “Basel III”: 
the quantity and quality of the capital; 
the funding structure 
their risk management requirements and capabilities; 
• 
– 
– 
– 
To  summarize,  the  legacy  of  previous  financial  excesses  and  the  following  crisis,  is  a 
changing  financial  landscape  ultimately  determined  by  international  financial  regulatory 
reform, local financial market characteristics and the crisis impact itself.

Following, in the second part of my speech I would like to briefly share some thoughts 
about possible implications for emerging markets and economies, including those in 
CESEE region. Such implications are determined by: 
(1) 
local financial system features and inherent risks; 
political and macroeconomic developments; 
(2) 
(3) 
approach to reforms’ implementation; 
In  terms  of  financial  system  features,  compared  to  advance  economies,  in  CESEE  the 
financial system is generally characterized by: 
– 
– 
– 
more reliance in retail (longer-term) funding and more “buy to hold” business model 
wider use of foreign currency in retail transactions; 
less complex financial system, good level of capitalization and simpler approach to 
risk management; 
 serving  as  “host”  to  foreign  financial  institutions  (usually  from  EU  advanced 
economies) 
higher reliance in banking to finance the public and private needs; 
evolving regulatory framework of the financial system; 
– 
– 
In terms of political and macroeconomic developments, CESEEs are generally characterized 
by: 
– 
efforts to develop the financial system and integrate more the local economy in the 
regional and world one (in Europe, the process is driven by the process of European 
Integration); 
stronger  macroeconomic  developments,  which  have  seen  improvement  in  the 
inflation  due  to  more  effective  monetary  policy,  better  use  of  economic  resources 
and better fiscal management; 
 staying “out” is not an option; 
less financial integration is not an option 
However, in terms of approach to international financial regulatory reforms implementation, 
given their features, CESEE will have to consider that: 
– 
– 
and,  given  the  complexity  of  reforms,  preparations  should  progress  quickly,  although  the 
pace of change should be carefully weighted and prioritized with local market features. 
In  this  regard,  to  my  opinion,  CESEE  may  feel  some  stress  impact  during  the  process  of 
reforms implementation which will come most likely from: 
– 
deleveraging,  in  terms  of  lower  “parent”  support  for  liquidity  and  lending  to  local 
economy; 
cross-jurisdictions similarity in economic and financial cyclicality; 
cross-border cooperation in supervision; 
possible capital movements and impact on exchange rate; 
political process as, in SEE, the EU integration process is determinant; 
– 
– 
– 
– 
Nevertheless, there is no option on “holding back” from the reforms for a long time, given the 
unstoppable  process  of  financial  integration  and  globalization.  Hence,  an  early  start  of  a 
pacing approach to financial regulatory reform is appropriate.

In  the  last  part  of  my  speech  I  would  like  to  stop  by  on  the  impact  on  Albania’s 
financial  sector  and  economy  and  possible  ways  to  avoid/mitigate  negative 
externalities. 
The features of our financial system are similar to those of other CESEEs. In fact: 
– 
– 
– 
– 
in Albania, the banking sector dominates the financial system; 
banking activity is concentrated and controlled by foreign banks (87% of the assets); 
in total there are 16 banks and the 4 biggest ones possess 68% of total assets. 
home countries are: Austria (1 bank), Greece (3), France (2), Italy (2), Turkey (1), 
Bulgaria (1). 
banks play the main role in meeting the private and public financing needs, and they 
rely heavily in local deposits to finance their activity; 
 Changes in the regulatory superstructure, and enforcement of the regulatory requirements, 
have had important impact on Albania’s financial sector and economy. More concretely: 
In the financial sector, we have experienced: 
– 
deleveraging in local financial assets investments, particularly seen at subsidiaries 
of  European  banking  groups,  as  they  try  to  meet  requirements  coming  after  EBA 
and ECB stress tests; 
increasing  preference  by  financial  institutions  to  place  local  funds  in  foreign 
investments (abroad); 
 lower financial intermediation to both private and public sector; 
negative impact on economic growth; 
In the economy, such behavior by some of the banks has materialized in: 
– 
– 
However, the stability of both, financial system and macroeconomic framework, have been 
saved and at this point I would like to state that we believe that there can be found ways to 
further avoid or mitigate any negative externalities. 
On deleveraging, Bank of Albania has raised the concern on such phenomena directly with 
the EU counterparts, but also through its role in Vienna II initiative. In this regard, we have 
highlighted  the  need  to  establish  effective  mechanisms  to  restore  healthy  lending  to 
economies of non-EU countries where subsidiaries of EU banking groups operate. 
Furthermore, we consider important to ensure that macro-prudential policies undertaken in 
the Euro-area, and banking group solutions originating from the EU, should take into account 
the relevant impact on non-EU host countries financial stability where systemically important 
EU  bank  subsidiaries  operate.  This  could  be  bridged  also  by  an  effective  exchange  of 
information  in  the  supervisory  colleges,  in  accordance  with  the  new  EU  directive  for  the 
recovery and resolution of banks, and particularly by working to remove barriers for non-EU 
host  countries  to  come  closer  to  the  European  forums  and  be  able  to  participate  and 
exchange their views. 
Despite some negative externalities that could be temporary, in the Bank of Albania we do 
believe that the Banking Union/Single Supervisory Mechanism and the new role provided to 
ECB, will also serve to improve the supervision of the banking sector in our country. This will 
come not only by much more consistent approach in supervision practices, but also through 
improving the coordination framework between home and host supervisors. In this regard, in 
the  Bank  of  Albania,  we  are  willing  and  hopeful  that  we  can  establish  a  much  stronger 
working relationship with the ECB. 
Thank you very much for your attention!
