Fatos Ibrahimi: The reduction of cash in the context of reducing the informal 
economy 
Speech  by  Mr  Fatos  Ibrahimi,  First  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Albania,  at  the  Conference 
“Reducing the informal economy – a challenge of the Albanian Government”, Tirana, 16 October 2006. 
 Since  the  inception  of  the  programme  undertaken  by  the  Bank  of  Albania,  in  cooperation  with  the 
Ministry  of  Economy  and the  Ministry of  Finance,  on  reducing  cash,  it  came  clear  that  the  issue  of 
cash  in  economy  cannot  be  treated  as  separate  from  the  issue  of  the  informal  economy.  The 
companies, which try not to expose their activities to the third parties, will avoid banks and will find 
alternative sources of financing and payment, mainly in cash. Therefore, the Government initiative on 
reducing the informal economy is to be welcomed when bearing in mind the great impact it will have 
on reducing the cash economy. 
It needs to be said that the process of formalizing the economy has not been considered as an excuse 
for not undertaking a number of measures and initiatives, which may accelerate the progress of cash 
reduction. Among the actions undertaken in this context, I would mention: 
The channelling of the state administration payrolls through the bank accounts 
1.  
At this moment, the entire public administration payrolls are channelled through the accounts with the 
commercial banks. Despite the initial reluctance of a part of the public administration employees, the 
withdrawal  of  payrolls  through  the  bank  accounts  has  now  turned  into  as  common  as  any  other 
services provided by the private market. The channelling of pensions through the bank accounts has 
met with certain complications, since the small amounts and the high circulation do not make them 
very  attractive  for  the  commercial  banks.  The  licensing  of  the  post  for  carrying  out  certain  banking 
services has resulted to be a good solution for this issue. 
The larger involvement of the private business in this process remains a challenge. In this context, the 
encouragement of channelling the payments through the banking system is a crucial step to be taken. 
The requirement of a rigorous application of the obligation that (small, medium and large) businesses 
have to open and operate with the bank accounts would not only serve to reduce cash but also to 
reduce the informality. 
Monthly utility payment (electricity, water, telephone) through the bank accounts 
2.  
The monthly utility payment is now made through banks. However, this is limited only to the clients of 
the bank the utilities have their account in. The holding of these utilities’ accounts with all the banks in 
the system, or the finding of a kind of interbank cooperation would not only serve to increasing the 
amount  of  payments  channelled  through  banks,  but  also  to  enhancing  the  competition.  Another 
difficulty  encountered  in  this  context  is  the  implementation  of  bank  accounts  direct  crediting  by  the 
utilities.  This  has  been  due  to  the  concentration  of  these  companies  in  certain  banks,  and  also 
because of the problems encountered in the standardization of the bills according to particular banks’ 
requirements. The Bank of Albania continues to be committed to finding a solution to these problems. 
The expansion of the ATMs and the POS (point of sale) 
3.  
Automated teller machines (ATMs) experienced a further development over 2005 - 2006. Most banks 
have established a number of ATMs in Tirana and in other main cities throughout the country. The 
number of electronic terminals has grown from 93 at the end 2004 to 266 in August of the present 
year, while the number of users has increased from 34,090 to about 295,250. ATMs are used through 
debit cards, but credit cards are also being widely used. Both Visa and MasterCard are actively being 
used in Albania and most banks are members in one of them, providing the respective cards. Although 
the  use  of  cards  is  still  limited,  the  growing  number  of  service  units  accepting  electronic  payments 
(POS-Point of Sale) from 155 in December 2004, to 1073 in August 2006, and the gradual change of

the attitude favouring the holding of cash will lead to the enhancement of the use of cards as a mean 
of payment. 
The  service  of  electronic  transactions  (e-banking)  as  a  banking  product  began  four  years  ago, 
although it may be said that it has not reached satisfying levels as far as its introduction and the use 
by  the  public  is  concerned.  So  far,  two  banks  have  been  providing  this  service  to  particular  clients 
(mainly businesses) for the carrying out of transfers, different payments etc. Over the present year, 
other banks have planned to provide this service.

The network and services expansion through the bank offices 
4.  
Over 2005 the banking system continued to expand its network rapidly within the Republic of Albania 
territory. It expanded with more than 50 branches and agencies throughout the country, although most 
of  them  were  established  in  Tirana.  A  considerable  number  of  branches  and  agencies  have  been 
opening  in  small  towns,  indicating  that  a  large  share  of  the  population  is  now  being  provided  with 
banking services. 
Almost all banks have established new branches and agencies, but just like in 2004, the opening of 29 
branches  and  agencies  by  the  small  banks  (G1  group)  makes  an  impact.  It  mainly  relates  to  the 
significant growing number of Banka Popullore branches, which opened 15 new branches throughout 
the territory of Albania over 2005, and to several other banks within this group, which expanded with 
some  new  branches  and agencies after  a  period  of  long  inactivity.  The  number of  employees  grew 
considerably  over  2005,  by  24  per  cent,  from  the  growth  of  26  per  cent  over 2004.  This  significant 
growth in the number of employees is mainly related to the expansion of the banking system network 
and  to  the  extension  of  the  banks’  activities,  which  requires  a  better  division  of  work  and  a  more 
complete  organizational  structure.  By  the  end  2005,  the  Albanian  banking  system  had  3,479 
employees, from 2,816 over the previous year. 
Compared to the previous year, the number of employees per banking unit decreased over 2005. In 
2005, banks had 13.9 employees per banking unit, compared to 15 over 2004. Such a decrease has 
been  a  consequence  of  the  growing  number  of  branches  and  agencies  with  higher  rates  than  the 
growth  of  the  number  of  employees.  A  considerable  number  of  branches  and  agencies  have  been 
established  in  sparsely  populated  areas;  as  a  consequence,  the  number  of  employees  in  these 
branches and agencies has been quite small. 
The  number  of  loan  officers  has  increased  considerably,  following  the  significant  growth  of  lending 
over 2005 and in the upcoming period. A considerable number of banks have restructured their loan 
departments, aiming at a more distinct division of duties and responsibilities. 
The increase in the number of banks, branches and their agencies, as well as the growing number of 
bank  employees  have  caused  the  coverage  of  the  population  to  improve  significantly.  Thus,  the 
number of inhabitants per bank, banking unit and per bank employee has decreased considerably.

The implementation of the Automatic Electronic Clearing House (AECH) project 
5.  
After  the  introduction  of  the  RTGS  system  for  the  settlement  of  gross  payments,  the  payments 
infrastructure expanded with the Automatic Electronic Clearing House (AECH) system, which aims at 
reducing the processing time of small value payments considerably, encouraging as such the use of 
banking payments. Over the present year, significant improvements have been made in terms of the 
information technology and communication with commercial banks, which has been indicated by the 
programmes  used  and  by  the  purchase  of  new  programmes  by  several  banks.  These  programmes 
constitute a better sustaining for the Banking Accounting Manual requirements and serve to the needs 
of the institution to expand the activity and introduce new services, such as e-banking. 
6.  
The review of the legal framework related to the payment system in the country, 
paying a special attention to that part which supports the new payment instruments 
and actors in the country 
The abovementioned developments in technology and information have been supported by the Bank 
of  Albania  through  the  formulation  of  the  Regulation  ”On  the  use  of  information  technology  and 
communication  of  the  entities  licensed  by  the  Bank  of  Albania”,  approved  upon  the  Supervisory 
Council decision No. 32, dated 3 May 2006. This regulation will not only assist the provision of a more 
prudent and complete supervision of the information technology and communication used by banks, 
but  at  the  same  time  it  will  help  banks  in  their  day-to-day  work  and  in  the  use  of  this  technology. 
Moreover,  it  will  increase  the  security  measures  that  banks  should  apply  in  order  to  provide  the 
security and the good use of the information, the maintenance of the information and the continuity of 
work in cases of extraordinary events. 
Another crucial issue to be paid a special attention to and where certain deficiencies are present, is 
the SWIFT system. There needs to be a better administration of the users’ profile, in order to observe 
the three stages of sending the messages (creation, verification and authorization), and a division of 
security officers’ duties (left and right officer) from the different operational duties at the SWIFT. 
It is also necessary that the internal bank audit (or external when provided by consultant companies) 
be expanded, including the information technology entirely. This audit, which currently is limited only to 
the system users’ profiles or to the access rights they have in the system, should include issues that 
relate to the functionality of these systems, the accuracy of generating the information, the changes in 
the  system,  the  information  security  during  the  operation  and  in  transmission  (for  on-line  branches) 
etc. 
7.  
The enhancement of transparency of the bank commissions applied for loan 
payments, and in particular the decrease or abolition of domestic commissions or of 
incoming payments, are another measure that the Bank of Albania is implementing in 
the context of attracting the public and businesses as far as the banking services are 
concerned. 
 Referring to the significant decrease of currency outside banks to total money – from 31 per cent in 
2002 to 24 per cent over the present year – as an important indicator of the cash economy, it can be 
said  that  the  abovementioned  measures  have  provided  their  effect.  However,  the  reduction  of  the 
informal economy remains a decisive factor in order to reach to the levels of cash in more developed 
economies,  which  is  below  10  per  cent.  In  this  context,  the  establishment  of  the  Credit  Information 
Bureau, initiated some time ago by the Bank of Albania and expected to finalize over the coming year, 
is believed to make an overwhelming contribution to reducing the business informality in the interbank 
level.
