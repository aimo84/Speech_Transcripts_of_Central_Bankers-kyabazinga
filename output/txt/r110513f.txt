Ewald Nowotny: Achieving financial stability – the role of the EU, the 
Euro and the ECB 
Opening speech by Prof Dr Ewald Nowotny, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of 
Austria, at the Salzburg Global Seminar on “New rules for global finance – which kinds of 
regulation are useful and which are counterproductive?”, hosted by the Central Bank of the 
Republic of Austria, Vienna, 8 March 2011. 
 Welcome to the Salzburg seminar:  
1. 
Ladies and Gentlemen: 
It  is  a  great  honor  for  me  and  the  Oesterreichische  Nationalbank  to  host  the  Salzburg 
Global Seminar exceptionally here in Vienna. Let me extend a warm welcome to all of you, 
in  particular  the  high-ranked  decision  makers  and  high-profile  experts  coming  from  all 
over the world. 
The Salzburg Seminar was founded in the immediate post-war period, when visions were 
so badly needed, by three young men from Harvard University as a center for intellectual 
exchange in the heart of Europe. More than half a century later, it has developed into one 
of Europe’s foremost forums for the discussion of global issues. It brings together future 
leaders  from  around  the  world  with  prominent  individuals  from  virtually  every  field  of 
human  activity:  politics,  economics,  social  and  environmental  concerns,  the  arts  and 
academia.  
The next three days are devoted to an issue which has shaped my life at least for the last 
three  years:  “New  Rules  for  Global  Finance:  Which  kinds  of  regulation  are  useful  and 
which are counterproductive?” In order to answer this tricky question, we need to learn the 
lessons from the recent financial and economic crisis. But even if the financial sector is 
in the core of our considerations, they also go far beyond. It is our whole economic model 
which needs to be checked.  
Let me present you my views on some of these topics. 
Sequencing of the financial and economic crises:  
2. 
Popular  perception  of  the  crisis  origins:  falling  prices  in  the  US  housing  market  led  to 
disturbances on the interbank market and finally to the financial crisis. 
Actually, a complex set of conditions, causes and trigger factors made the crisis possible: 
– 
First, basic conditions: disequilibria evolving over the last years: 
 
Global  imbalances  inducing  financial  flows  from  emerging  to  advanced 
economies; 
Increasing  weight  of  the  financial  industry  in  the  economy;  in  U.S.A.  the 
share doubled since 1980 to reach about 8% of GDP in 20081; 
Global interest rates – arguably at least for some time too low; 
Related trend to household indebtedness, partly fueled by policies expanding 
homeownership to the poor2;

 Insufficient framework and rules of the international financial system; 
Trend towards income and wealth inequality within advanced economies3; 
Oil shock until mid-2008 seems to have contributed to recession4. 
 
 
 
Second, more immediate causes: asset market bubbles: 
 
Bubbles  started  with  financial  innovations  –  turning  mortgages  into  liquid 
assets; 
These innovations led to bubbles that were fostered by a huge, unregulated 
shadow banking sector – excessive leverage;  
Intransparent products of “financial industry” attracted risk-loving investors5;  
False management incentives favoring short-termism. 
 
 
Third, the triggering factors that helped the bubbles burst: 
 
 
Massive defaults in the U.S. subprime mortgage market; 
In a second step, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. 
  Preliminary conclusion: Financial crisis has been caused by a market failure, however, the 
ignorance of its risk is a major policy failure, 
– 
Stemming from inadequate regulation and supervision of financial (and housing) 
markets; 
As well as overly loose global monetary policy.

 Dramatic drop in confidence; 
Plunge of international trade and manufacturing. 
interbank market dried up; 
Banks refinanced themselves with fire sales of their assets (asset meltdown).  
First, banking sector immediately hit by liquidity shortage: 
 
 
Second, the crisis reached the real economy  Great Recession: 
 
 
Third, a truly global crisis: 
 
Finally, domino effect – entire countries: 
 
 
 
 
 
Rapid deterioration of budgets (anticrisis measures & automatic stabilisors); 
Structural vulnerabilities of several economies got evident; 
Liquidity problems endanger refinancing of public debt; 
Perceived risk of sovereign insolvency by financial markets; 
Overshooting  of  risk  premia  on  bonds  interest  rates  created  self-fulfilling 
prophecy effects. 
No decoupling of emerging economies (however recovery started first their). 
Greece is a case in point, but also a very special case:  
Fraud of budgetary statistics – loss in confidence; 


  Greece’s fiscal situation worse than any other EU Member State (public debt 
around 140% of GDP in 2010; deficit now improving: 9.6% in 2010); 
Interest rate spreads to German 10-year bonds above 900 basis points; 
Rescue package of EMU MS and IMF (strong conditionality!): 110 bn EUR for 
3 years:  
 
 
Eliminated liquidity risk;  
Bought  time  to  reduce  (perceived)  sovereign  solvency  and  (derived) 
financial market risks. 
  Ireland is a different case (10-y spreads above 600 bps):  
 
Always obeyed to the Stability and Growth Pact: Fiscal surpluses instead of 
deficits;  
Problems  arouse  from  overextended  financial  sector  hit  by  a  housing 
bubble; 
Mistake in crisis management: state guarantee of whole banking sector; 
Public  debt  exploded  fourfold  within  3  years  (from  around  25%  in  2007  to 
almost 100% in 2010); 
Under rescue umbrella of EU/IMF: 85 bn EUR. 
 
Other countries not comparable: (10-y spreads only around 200 to 400 bps) 
 
Portugal: problems less severe and different: competitiveness but no housing 
bubble! Nevertheless, meager growth prospects and high interest rates make 
Portugal susceptible to refinancing risks.  
Spain:  low  initial  debt  level  (40%  of  GDP),  in  2010:  64%  –  still  below 
Germany’s  debt  (76%),  but  strong  dynamics;  relatively  sound  banks  despite 
housing bubble; 
Italy:  low  liquidity  risks,  high saving  rate,  low external  debt  (but  high  overall 
debt). 
  A euro crisis?  
 
 
  Misperception: crises not euro area origin but contagion from global crises;  
Exaggeration: break-up of EMU or end of the euro no issue! (Too costly for 
all participants); 
Crisis of few euro area countries not of euro: Just like California and Illinois 
– not affecting the US dollar;  
The euro remains a success story! 
 
Euro  area  =  stability  area:  Over  the  last  decade,  average  inflation 
exactly  matched  ECB’s  definition  of  price  stability  (below  but  close  to 
2%), despite heavy oil shock; 
Euro = at least as strong a currency as German mark:  
Against  USD  stronger 
1.18 EUR/USD in 1999); 
Marginal devaluation of effective exchange rate = relief for our exporters, 
after years of appreciation.

 Elimination of exchange rate volatility – beneficial for small member 
states: “in turbulent financial waters it is better to be on a large, solid and 
steady ship rather than on a small vessel,” (ECB President Trichet); 
Europe proved its solidarity and ability to act – (recovery plan, rescue 
umbrella, reform debate); 
ECB reacted swiftly and effectively – avoiding a collapse of the whole 
economy: 
 providing boldly liquidity to banks:  
No inflationary impact as long as low credit demand; 
Exit already underway.  
 Securities Market Programme – temporary purchasing of bonds:  
 No state financing – only to calm markets; 
Temporary, secondary market, very limited amount; 
Recovery  on  its  way  (but  slow  and  bumpy):  2010:  1.7%;  forecasts  2011:  around 
1,6%); 
Nevertheless national adjustment challenges still exist: structural reforms + fiscal 
discipline.

Timing of consolidation and structural reforms is crucial: 
 
In  some  countries,  concerns  for  fiscal  solvency  –  immediate  tightening  of 
fiscal policy necessary; 
However, majority of euro area countries: delicate balancing act avoiding a 
premature and abrupt fiscal tightening; 
Currently, window of opportunity: 
 
Demand  side:  Relatively  weak  euro  and  high  growth  in  emerging 
markets;  
Supply side: Expected decline in the working-age population not started 
yet. (In Austria, the decline will start around 2020.) 
 Packages  for  Greece  and  Ireland  and  measures  ECB  to  stabilize  bond 
markets have bought some time to undertake substantial reforms; 
Consolidation  measures  announced  as  soon  as  possible  to  convince 
financial markets.

  Consolidation should focus on expenditure side, especially where fiscal burden is 
already high (like Austria). 
However,  given  the  size  of  consolidation  needs,  supplementary  tax  increases 
necessary in many cases:  
 
Less  distortive  taxes,  for  instance  on  energy  or  wealth  –  to  prevent 
undermining long-term growth potential; 
Reforms  of  the  tax  structure  –  to  enhance  growth  and  labor  market 
participation.

  Inflation  expectations  firmly  anchored:  below,  but  close  to  2%  over  the 
medium term; 
Risk: commodity prices (wheat, oil, etc.); 
But expansive monetary policy not inflationary – can easily be reversed!

 
Crisis lesson: monetary policy’s role (Jackson Hole Consensus): 
 
Preserving both price stability and financial market stability; 
“Leaning against the wind”: difficult in practice; 
 
However  more  tools  (blurring  boundaries  between  monetary  policy  and

regulation); 
Price stability = sine qua non for financial stability (but not sufficient). 
  Conclusion 
Despite criticism, reform progress has been substantial. 
Enough to avoid future crisis? Certainly not, but hopefully enough to render crisis 
less severe. 
Remaining reform workload is huge.  
Changes in the regulatory framework are not technical matters alone implemented 
by pressing a button by a benevolent social planner.  
Resistance  from  vested  interests  and  lobbyists  endanger  success  of  reform 
agenda.  
Policy  makers  need  support  for  their  ambitious  project  of  securing  future 
economic stability in Europe and elsewhere.
