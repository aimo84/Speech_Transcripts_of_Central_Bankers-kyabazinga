Ignazio Visco: The impact of the crisis on financial integration in Central 
and Eastern Europe 
Speech by Mr Ignazio Visco, Governor of the Bank of Italy, at the conference “Twenty years 
of  transition  –  experiences  and  challenges”,  hosted  by  the  National  Bank  of  Slovakia, 
Bratislava, 3 May 2013.

Introduction 
The global financial crisis has been severe and widespread, affecting different economies in 
different and long-lasting ways. The transition countries of Central and Eastern Europe1 have 
been  no  exception:  their  quite  rapid  financial  integration  over  the  past  twenty-years  has 
brought enduring economic benefits but also left them relatively more exposed to the global 
financial  turmoil,  through  their  links  with  Western  European  banks,  which  hold  dominant 
stakes in the region’s markets.  
Financial  stability  has  become  a  fundamental  objective  of  policy-making  once  again,  and 
central banks are heavily involved  in this endeavor, which calls for a thorough overhaul of 
financial  regulation  and  supervision.  Tomorrow’s  financial  system  will  be  different from  the 
one that has developed over the last two decades. 
Global financial integration during the past decade 
In the decade before the financial crisis the financial system grew dramatically in size, and its 
role and pervasiveness in the economy increased in comparable measure. Since the advent 
of the crisis, this process has not been interrupted but only slowed down. In the euro area, 
the  total  financial  resources  collected  by  the  private  sector  (bank  credit,  bonds  issued 
domestically  and  stock  market  capitalization)  rose  from  160  per  cent  of  GDP  in  1996  to 
240 per cent in 2007, before slipping to 230 per cent in 2011. A similar pattern is found for 
the United States, where over those same years the ratio rose from 230 to 330 per cent and 
then declined to 260 per cent in 2011 (Figure 1). Driven by the revolution in information and 
communications  technology  and  by  the  process  of  financial  integration,  there  was  a 
considerable  expansion  in  the  supply  of  derivatives  products,  the  securitization  of  banks’ 
assets, and so-called structured financial instruments. The total outstanding notional amount 
of over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivatives rose from about 94 trillion U.S. dollars 
at the end of 1998 to around 670 trillion dollars at the end of 2007 and has hovered around 
that  level  since  (Figure  2).  An  important  aspect  of  this  process  has  been  international 
financial  integration.  In  the  last  decade  industrial  countries’  gross  external  financial  assets 
and liabilities more than doubled in proportion to GDP, reaching 440 per cent at the end of 
2007 (Figure 3). 
Financial  market  development  in  the  emerging  economies  has  also  been  dramatic.  Total 
financial  resources  collected  by  the  private  sector  (outstanding  stocks  of  bank  credit, 
domestic  debt  securities  and  equity  market  capitalization)  increased  from  about  120  to 
230 per cent of GDP between 1996 and 2007 for the emerging Asian economies as a group, 
and from about 40 to almost 100 per cent for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe

Slovenia, Slovakia and Estonia, which joined the euro area in 2007, 2009 and 2011, respectively, insofar as 
the main focus is on international financial integration from the perspective of transition countries.

(Figure 4).2 International financial integration – with foreign direct and portfolio investment and 
the  involvement  of  foreign  banks  in  domestic  financial  systems  –  was  boosted  by  the 
overcoming of a series of obstacles: macroeconomic instability, vulnerable external positions 
and  inefficient  institutional  and  regulatory  setups.  Since  the  mid-2000s,  this  process  has 
been greatly furthered by exceptionally favorable global financial conditions, with abundant 
liquidity, low risk aversion, and falling long-term interest rates. 
Financial integration in Central and Eastern Europe 
The  transition  countries  of  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  were  the  recipients  of  a  massive 
influx of capital from abroad, mostly from Western Europe. Between 2003 and 2008 capital 
inflows reached very high levels – averaging more than 12 per cent of GDP – compared with 
an  average  for  the  emerging  market  countries  overall  of  about  6  per  cent  (Figure  5).  The 
transition  countries  were  perceived  as  attractive  investment  opportunities:  the  lure  of 
potential  high  returns,  underpinned  by  relatively  low  wages  and  capital-output  ratios,  was 
reinforced  by  the  prospect  of  faster  income  convergence  entailed  by  economic  and 
institutional  developments  in  the  context  of  EU  membership  and  expectations  of  rapid 
interest rate convergence in connection with the eventual adoption of the euro.  
Financial  integration  in  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  has  been  nearly  unique.  International 
banks played a fundamental role indeed in spurring financial integration. In the years running 
up  to  the  global  financial  crisis,  Western  European  banks  expanded  rapidly  in  the  region, 
gaining substantial market shares through branches and subsidiaries; by 2008 they held as 
much  as  80  per  cent  of  total  banking  assets  in  these  countries.  The  entry  of  foreign 
intermediaries  with  long-term  strategic  goals  and  the  ensuing  radical  transformation  of  the 
ownership structure of banks in the CEE countries was a crucial element of discipline and 
stability  in  breaking  the  vicious  circle  of  systemic  crises  and  macroeconomic  volatility  that 
had marked the early years of transition. It is generally accepted that international financial 
integration has played a positive role in the long-term process of economic convergence in 
the CEE transition countries: long-term per capita GDP growth in the region before the crisis 
was  positively  correlated  with  conventional  measures  of  financial  integration,  such  as  the 
ratio of gross foreign assets and liabilities to GDP (Figure 6). The evidence of this linkage in 
other  emerging  areas  tends  to  be  less  clear-cut.  The  key  extra  contributing  factor  for  the 
countries  of  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  may  well  be  the  interaction  with  institutional 
convergence  implicit  in  the  EU  accession  process.  Thanks  to  this  unique,  favourable 
combination,  presumably  financial  integration  as  such  acted  as  a  catalyst  for  the 
development  of  the  domestic  financial  sector  and  the  adoption  of  structural  reforms  to 
strengthen the institutional framework.  
However, a balanced account of the process of financial integration in this region must not 
overlook  such  drawbacks  as  excessive,  cheap  lending,  currency  mismatches  and  demand 
overheating in the years running up to the crisis. Between 2003 and 2008, many economies 
recorded  rapid  import  growth,  real-estate  bubbles  and  wage  increases  far  outpacing 
productivity  gains  –  sometimes  rooted  in  overly  optimistic  expectations  of  fast  income 
convergence. Inflationary pressures spilled over into the tradeable sector and cut into export 
performance. Balance-of-payments deficits on  current account widened (Figure 7). Several 
countries  accumulated  large  external  debts  (Figure  8),  largely  private  and  denominated  in 
foreign currency, making them vulnerable to a reversal of the capital flow or depreciation of 
the currency. When the global crisis began to impact on these countries, there was a sharp 
decline in capital inflows and a consequent slowdown in bank credit (Figure 9).

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
Although there was concern over the possible meltdown of domestic financial systems driven 
by a rush of foreign banks to exit, a fully-fledged financial crisis along the lines of that in East 
Asia in 1997–98 did not materialize. Overall, during the first phase of the crisis, the reversal 
of  capital  flows  was  actually  less  severe  than  in  other  emerging  areas.  In  some  cases 
(Hungary,  Latvia  and  Romania)  substantial  financial  support  from  the  EU  and  the  main 
international  financial  institutions  was  crucial  to  avoiding  the  worst;  coordination  between 
home and host country authorities, international financial institutions and multinational banks, 
in  the  context  of  the  Vienna  Initiative,  also  helped  prevent  the  sort  of  collective  action 
problems that could have triggered the feared massive withdrawal of foreign banks.3 There is 
evidence that the foreign banks that participated in the Vienna Initiative were relatively stable 
lenders.4 
Moreover,  the  distinctive  model  of  financial  integration  in  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  – 
where  foreign  banks  operate  mainly  through  local  subsidiaries  and  branches  in  the  retail 
market  –  evidently  offered  a  high  degree  of  risk-sharing  and  stability  during  the  crisis,  as 
parent banks tended to be less sensitive to information asymmetry and counterparty credit 
risk and more committed to long-term market prospects, given the important sunk costs of 
their in-country structures. This compares favourably with the dominant pattern in the other 
EU  countries,  where  external  borrowing  by  domestic  banks  is  mainly  in  cross-border 
wholesale markets.5 
The  differing  intensity  of  the  boom-bust  cycle  in  the  various  CEE  countries  suggests  that 
apart from the influence of specific structural features (such as differences in starting income 
levels,  international  trade  and  financial  links),  domestic  policy  had  a  role,  although  capital 
inflows of the magnitudes observed in the region in the run-up to the crisis would certainly 
have strained any toolkit available to national policy makers. 
Monetary  and  exchange  rate  regimes  probably  played  a  critical  role  in  determining  each 
country’s  ability  to  counteract  the  effects  of  capital  inflows:  the  internal  and  external 
imbalances of the fixed- and floating-exchange-rate countries differed in size.6 The countries 
with fixed-exchange-rate regimes had sharper credit booms, higher inflation rates and larger 
current account deficits than the floating-rate countries, on average. Yet the contribution of 
the exchange rate regime remains an open issue; the question is whether the more extreme 
boom-bust cycle was driven mainly by the fixed exchange regime as such or rather by the 
inconsistency  of  the  overall  policy  mix  in  countries  where  this  setting  was  in  place;  in 
particular, a stricter fiscal stance and a better macroprudential policy framework might have 
at least partly compensated for the absence of exchange rate flexibility.  
As for monetary policy, the experience of the CEE countries appears to confirm that it is a 
less effective lever for restraining credit booms in small, financially open economies. This is 
the case even for floating-rate regimes, as a number of factors – currency substitution in the 
form of balance-sheet effects associated with initial high euroization, or the shift to foreign-
                                                
3   The  “Vienna  Initiative”  brought  together  systemically  important  cross-border  banks,  home  and  host  country 
authorities, and international financial institutions to produce a coordinated response to the crisis. The banks 
pledged to their  continuing commitment  to  the  region, and  in  the  case  of  five countries with  IMF-supported 
programmes  (Bosnia  Herzegovina,  Hungary,  Latvia,  Serbia,  and  Romania)  the  parent  banks  pledged  to 
maintain their exposure.

Paper, No. 143, March 2012.

In the period before the crisis, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania adopted hard pegs to the euro; Slovenia 
followed  an  intermediate  crawling-band  regime;  the  Czech  Republic,  Hungary,  Poland,  Romania,  and  the 
Slovak Republic were floaters.

currency-denominated  lending  –  could  undermine  or  even  reverse  the  intended  effect  of 
monetary tightening.  
This underscores the importance of maintaining a prudent fiscal stance during credit booms. 
Actually,  in  the  years  preceding  the  crisis  headline  fiscal  positions  in  most  CEE  countries 
were  broadly  balanced,  but  in  many  cases  this  was  the  result  of  exceptional  revenues 
associated  with  cyclical  demand  and  asset  price  booms.  Adjusted  for  these  factors,  the 
underlying fiscal positions looked much less healthy. With hindsight it is easy to recognize 
the  need  for  a  conservative  approach  in  evaluating  tax  revenues  during  booms,  and  the 
useful  role  of  automatic  stabilizers  (particularly  income  taxes  and  welfare  spending)  in 
increasing fiscal policy flexibility and attenuating economic fluctuations. 
In  addition  to  the  standard  macro  policy  tools,  CEE  countries  also  took  a  wide  range  of 
prudential actions before the crisis. Prudential instruments can prevent or contain systemic 
financial  risk  in  upswings  (by  affecting  the  incentives  associated  with  asset  price  booms, 
foreign  exchange  lending,  excessive  risk-taking  and  the  erosion  of  lending  standards)  and 
can  also  build  buffers  to  cushion  the  impact  of  downturns.  In  general  the  evidence  is  that 
these measures produced the intended effects in the short run but sometimes failed to have 
a  lasting  impact  on  credit  dynamics.  In  some  instances,  in  fact,  circumvention  of  the 
prudential intervention through direct cross-border financing and/or lending from unregulated, 
non-bank financial intermediaries proved to be a major issue; this was the case with direct 
limits on credit growth. A more effective role in containing systemic financial risks was played 
by measures specifically devised to build liquidity and loss-absorbing capital buffers, such as 
reserve and capital requirements. And when they were appropriately formulated, prudential 
regulations helped to curb the growth of foreign exchange loans and to keep default rates 
lower during the crisis.  
Lessons learnt from the global crisis: in search of better regulation 
Global financial deepening and international integration have resulted in greater risk sharing 
and  made  finance  accessible  to  more  countries,  households  and  firms,  thus  proving 
instrumental  in  broadening  economic  development.  But  an  interlinked  and  more  closely 
connected financial system heightens the risks of contagion. Most importantly, the crisis has 
shown that market participants were not capable of mastering the inherent complexity of the 
system that they themselves had developed. And it has highlighted the shortcomings of the 
idea  that  self-regulation  and  market  discipline  are  sufficient  to  ensure  stable  financial 
systems. In this regard, accepting the concept of benign neglect was a critical mistake on the 
part  of  regulators.  Rather,  financial  regulation  and  supervision  have  to  keep  pace  with 
developments in the financial industry. Moreover, national authorities need to be aware of the 
risk that their powers may become narrow compared to the sphere of influence of the global 
financial  players.  The  coordination  of  financial  supervision  across  countries  and  across 
sectors is a key condition for the stability of the global financial system.7  
A major effort is required at the national but especially at the international level to strengthen 
the  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework.  At  the  international  level,  under  the  political 
impulse  of  the  G-20,  the  Financial  Stability  Board  (FSB)  and  the  Basel  Committee  on 
Banking Supervision have introduced substantial regulatory changes to prevent new financial 
crises and enhance the resilience of economic systems. Much has been already achieved. 
The  quantity  of  capital  that  banks  need  to  hold  has  been  significantly  increased  and  the 
quality  enhanced,  in  order  to  ensure  that  they  operate  on  a  safe  and  sound  basis. 
International  standards for  bank  liquidity  and  funding  have  also  been  instituted to  promote 
the  resilience  of  banks  to  liquidity  shocks.  Initiatives  have  been  taken  to  strengthen  the

regulation of the OTC derivatives market, aimed at reinforcing market infrastructures, in order 
to  minimize  contagion  and  spill-over  effects  among  today’s  more  closely  interconnected 
players. But further progress in important areas is needed, in that bank capital and liquidity 
regulation must be accompanied by improvements in internal risk control arrangements and 
actions aimed at correcting the incentives for excessive risk-taking.  
What is more, it is indispensable to level the playing field, since when a country relaxes the 
rules in order to attract financial intermediaries it generates negative externalities for other 
countries.  The  transition  to  a  uniform  system  of  rules  and  financial  oversight  must  be 
hastened. In the euro area, and in the European Union at large, the plan for a banking union 
is  ambitious,  to  be  sure,  but  this  is  the  direction  in  which  to  move.  Among  other  things,  it 
would  limit  regulatory  arbitrage,  help  remove  national  bias  in  supervision,  and  reduce  the 
phenomenon of “regulatory capture” by powerful cross-border banks, while at the same time 
reducing  compliance  costs  for  cross-border  banks  and  enhancing  the  functioning  of  the 
single market for financial services. The planned European banking union would also benefit 
the economies of Central and Eastern Europe. It would work against the fragmentation of the 
European financial markets along national lines and – by enhancing the financial resilience of 
the euro area – it would reduce the risks of negative spill-over effects to the CEE banking 
systems.  
In conclusion 
The recovery of the CEE economies remains fragile. With few exceptions, output, held back 
by debt overhang and direct and indirect exposure to the eurozone debt crisis, has not yet 
regained pre-crisis levels. Import demand from the euro area remains at depressed levels. 
And although financial conditions have improved since the end of 2011 they remain volatile. 
Bank credit dynamics remain weak, reflecting subdued domestic demand and a large volume 
of  non-performing  loans.  The  banking  systems  of  most  of  these  countries  remain  well 
capitalized,  however,  and  are  consequently  in  a  position  to  withstand  the  lingering 
deterioration of their asset quality.  
The  financial  legacy  of  the  crisis  will  not  be  short-lived.  The  evolution  of  the  international 
banking sector in the coming years will continue to shape financial conditions also in the CEE 
countries. The regulatory and supervisory responses adopted at global level will imply more 
stringent capital and liquidity requirements. In response to these more demanding rules, as 
well  as  to  spontaneous  market  forces,  international  banks  are  adapting  their  business 
strategies, unwinding unsustainable pre-crisis practices and shifting to longer-term sources 
of funding. In this context the main European banks with large stakes in the CEE markets are 
gradually going over to more decentralized business models, in which subsidiaries will have 
to rely more heavily on local sources of funds and set their lending conditions accordingly. 
Orderly and even desirable for the resilience of the global financial system as this process 
may  be,  it  could  also  put  significant  pressures  on  emerging  countries  that  are  highly 
dependent  on  external  financing  owing  to  underdeveloped  domestic  financial  systems  and 
structurally  low  national  saving  rates.  Indeed,  this  calls  for  decisive  reforms  to  bolster  the 
development and deepening of local money and capital markets, including the issuance of 
bonds denominated in local currency. The process will be lengthy and complex, requiring a 
suitable legal framework, adequate infrastructures, a large institutional investor base, stable 
macroeconomic conditions and predictable policy-making, as has been demonstrated by the 
extensive  analysis  conducted  and  the  guidelines  then  issued  by  the  Bank  of  International 
Settlements (BIS), the World Bank and the G20.8 Several of these conditions have already 
been achieved in the process of integration in the EU.

Against  the  backdrop  of  this  changing  financial  environment,  one  risk  is  that,  arguing  the 
need  to  preserve  domestic  financial  stability,  national  regulators  could  adopt  ring-fencing 
measures,  hampering  the  smooth  functioning  of  the  EU  single  market.  As  the  long-term 
benefits  of  free  capital  mobility  and  international  financial  integration  remain  substantial, 
averting this risk requires that the EU institutions, notably the European Commission and the 
European  Banking  Authority,  play  a  greater  role  in  monitoring  these  measures  and 
enhancing coordination among national regulators, in order to avoid the fragmentation of the 
European financial markets.
