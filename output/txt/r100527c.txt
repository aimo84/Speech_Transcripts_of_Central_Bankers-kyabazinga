The last few years have brought unprecedented challenges to macroeconomic management 
in small, open economies. The severe inflationary shock that began in 2007 was followed by 
the  worst  financial  crisis  since  the Great  Depression  and a  worldwide  economic  recession 
with  no  match  in  the  postwar  period.  Today,  a  while  after  the  immediate  resolution  of  the 
crisis, we face new challenges. On the one hand, some developed economies, whose public 
finances  were  severely  damaged  by  the  great  recession,  now  face  a  period  of  drastic 
macroeconomic adjustments and, in some cases, uncertainty about how their debts will be 
restructured.  On  the  other  hand,  a  substantial  segment  of  emerging  economies,  which 
suffered  no  permanent  damages  in  the  balance  sheets  of  their  households,  firms,  or 
governments,  is  currently  experiencing  what  can  be  an  incipient  start  of  a  credit  and 
economic  rebound.  The  new  momentum  of  capital  inflows  mirrors  this  phenomenon.  The 
current  status  of  these  inflows  and  how  to  deal  with  them  are  a  substantial  part  of  the 
challenges we face today and the substance of this document.  
Capital inflows in perspective 
After the boom of 2006–2007, and the sharp collapse of 2008 and part of 2009, capital flows 
to emerging economies have picked up. Investments in stock and fixed-income mutual funds 
in emerging economies have recovered and in some regions have exceeded pre-crisis levels 
(figure  1).  Corporate  bond  issuance,  which  nearly  stopped  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2008, 
regained their pre-crisis levels, starting from the second half of 2009 (figure 2). International 
interbank credit flows also stopped falling by mid-2009, although a significant recovery is yet 
to  be  seen  (figure  3).  This  is  consistent  with  the  relatively  weaker  balance  sheets  of 
international  banks  compared  with  increased  investment  possibilities  of  global  funds  and 
capital markets. Summing up, with the financial crisis behind us, capital flows have returned 
to emerging economies, but it is not evident that they currently exceed their pre-crisis levels. 
Financial  asset  prices  have  also  reflected  this  process.  In  emerging  markets,  the  price-to-
earnings ratio dropped during the crisis, but is currently back to 2007 levels (figure 4). The 
real  exchange  rate  fluctuated  significantly  over  the  past  three  years,  but  it  is  currently  not 
significantly away from its 2007 levels (figure 5).  
Short-term  interest  rate  differentials  between  emerging  and  industrialized  countries  have 
narrowed, since emerging economies also eased their monetary policies (figure 6). This has 
occurred, after the widening that happened during the crisis, as a result of a faster monetary 
expansion in the economies that were at the center of the problems, particularly the US. In 
the future, given the weaker cyclical behavior of developed economies, these differentials will 
probably increase, providing renewed incentives for capital flows to emerging economies. In 
this  case,  the  appearance  of  short-term  interest  rate  differentials  would  be  a  symptom  of 
cyclical  divergence  between  developed  and  emerging  economies.  Furthermore,  in  the 
coming years, the fundamentals of economic growth across economic zones, together with 
the deleveraging process in the developed world, could also encourage more capital flows 
into emerging economies, even if short-term turbulences in financial markets delay or push 
back its occurrence. 
The  fact  that  capitals  are  flowing  into  emerging  economies  with  renewed  vigor  does  not 
mean  that  all  such  flows  are  being  absorbed  in  net  terms.  If  inflows  are  counteracted  by 
comparable outflows, no significant impact should be felt either by output or the exchange

rate. Thus, for the purposes of analyzing the exchange rate, it is important to examine net 
capital  flows.  Given  the  balance  of  payments  identity,  net  capital  inflows  must  equal  the 
current account deficit plus the hoarding of international reserves, the latter being equivalent 
to capital outflows conducted by the central bank. In any case, the prices of assets in the 
economy  may  be  affected  by  gross  flows  depending  on  their  composition,  which  matters 
from a financial stability point of view. 
More  complex  scenarios  are  those  where  capital  inflows  trigger  a  credit  and  a  domestic 
spending  boom  by  financing  the  leveraging  of  households,  firms  or  government.  In  these 
circumstances, the counterpart of capital inflows is an increase in the current account deficit. 
If  this  phenomenon  does  not  occur  facing  an  abrupt  capital  inflow  increase,  it  means  that 
capitals  are  flowing  out  as  well.  It  is  less  than  evident  that,  from  a  mere  macroeconomic 
consistency perspective, gross capital inflows or outflows cause severe disruptions. If in the 
short run, because of frictions in financial markets, momentary illiquidity or portfolio effects, 
simultaneous inflows and outflows stress the markets, they could be dealt by using liquidity 
providing instruments that are regularly used by central banks. 
This discussion centers around the main macroeconomic impacts, with a special emphasis 
on inflation, output, and the exchange rate. However, it is worth noting that, from a financial 
stability  perspective,  monitoring  requires  also  paying  attention  to  other  effects  caused  by 
capital flows. Accordingly, important areas to monitor, aside from the behavior of the current 
account  and  its  counter-entry  in  the  capital  account,  are  asset  prices  and  the  evolution  of 
global  credit.  Also  important  is  using  macro-prudential  measures  to  complement  monetary 
policies.  
In any case, the current scenario differs distinctively from other periods of booming capital 
inflows  to  emerging  economies.  For  example,  in  the  early  1980s  there  were  massive  net 
capital  inflows  to  Latin  American  countries  (figure  7).  When  it  reversed,  because  of  an 
increase in interest rates in the United States, the debt crisis burst and a period of no capital 
flows to the region started. This type of experiences is precisely the one that makes us be 
very cautious when confronted with massive capital inflows, because a reversal could trigger 
drastic output adjustments. 
Later  on,  in  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s,  Latin  America  was  again  the  recipient  of 
substantial capital inflows, which has been thoroughly analyzed in Calvo et al. (1993, 1994). 
At that time there was also an increase in the current account deficit. Today, considering the 
forecasts for 2010–2011 contained in the WEO of April 2010, no net inflows are expected for 
regions as a whole, but what is expected is a reduction in the current account surpluses of 
emerging economies. Although this scenario has not evidently materialized, it presents risks 
that have to be considered. 
Finally, while in the current setting inflows have been offset by similar outflows, we cannot 
disregard  the  possibility  of  sudden  gross  outflows  or  sudden  stops  of  gross  inflows, 
generating severe adjustments in the current account with high costs in terms of output.  
Traditional policy options 
The  first  line  of  defense  against  massive  capital  inflows  is  exchange  rate  flexibility. 
Frequently exchange rate rigidities and unsustainable defenses of parities that are away from 
their fundamental value give way to speculation against the foreign exchange regime. The 
literature  on  speculative  attacks shows  how  an  exchange  rate  that  is inconsistent with  the 
rest  of  the  policy  actions  can  trigger  massive  capital  outflows  that  end  up  forcing  its 
abandonment.  The  same  rationale  applies  to  inflows.  If  the  exchange  rate  level  that  is 
intended to be defended is inconsistent with economic fundamentals, massive inflows can be 
created  that  will  sooner  or  later  appreciate  the  domestic  currency  in  real  terms.  Investors 
take  advantage  of  a  relatively  cheap  currency  to  enter  capitals  before  the  appreciation 
occurs,  and  get  a  significant  capital  gain.  Hence,  within  a  framework  of  capital  mobility, 
foreign exchange flexibility avoids one-sided bets over the exchange rate.

Furthermore,  an  inflation  targeting  regime  with  a  floating  exchange  rate  provides  a  good 
buffer  to  smooth  the  impact  of  changes  in  capital  flow  cycles.  The  same  monetary  policy 
reaction  to  a  currency  appreciation  that  reduces  inflationary  pressures,  allows  limiting  the 
currency appreciation process by narrowing interest rate differentials. 
A second line of defense is a symmetrical opening of the financial account. Many countries 
have  approached  financial  integration  by  opening  their  economies  to  capital  inflows,  still 
holding on to their constraints to local capital outflows, especially from institutional investors. 
After  a  while,  and  as  a  reaction  to  massive  capital  inflows,  restrictions  on  outflows  are 
allowed to become less stringent. However, this is normally done too late and signals fear of 
capital inflows. In fact it can even reinforce the phenomenon, particularly when the exchange 
rate has reached unsustainable levels. 
Having  a  well  regulated  and  developed  financial  system  is  a  requisite  for  properly 
accommodating exchange rate and capital movements. This is because it makes it easier to 
prevent  exchange  rate 
financial  conditions.  Currency 
mismatches  have  been  at  the  origin  of  many  banking  crises  in  emerging  economies. 
Nonetheless,  their  financial  systems’  resilience  to  exchange  rate  fluctuations  toward  late 
2008  and  early  2009  showed 
learned,  and  effects  on  banks’ 
balance-sheets, that would have translated an external recession into a far-reaching financial 
crisis,  were  avoided.  Of  course  there  were  exceptions,  particularly  in  emerging  Europe, 
where fragilities arose precisely because of the rigidity of their exchange rate systems and 
currency mismatches of their banks. 
Another  reason  of  the  importance  of  having  a  well-functioning  financial  market  is  the 
distortions  caused  by  exchange  rate  volatility  on  resource  allocation.  In  order  to  minimize 
such effects it is prudent to develop an exchange rate hedging market allowing producers in 
the tradable sector to hedge against exchange rate fluctuations at least at one year’s term. In 
fact,  evidence  shows  that  hedging  markets  are  more  developed  in  economies  with  more 
flexible exchange rates, because it is that flexibility that creates incentives for these hedging 
mechanisms to develop (De Gregorio and Tokman, 2005; Kamil and Sutton, 2008). If, on the 
contrary,  the  monetary  authority  attempts  to  provide  stability,  the  market  will  have  no 
incentives to develop hedging instruments. 
However, a floating exchange rate and an inflation targeting regime may be insufficient for 
stabilizing large amounts of capital inflows. The appreciation that results from massive capital 
inflows and a credit boom cycle may require other instruments to stabilize the economy and 
ensure  the  smooth  functioning  of  the  financial  system.  Under  such  circumstances,  one 
should resort mainly to fiscal policy. A tighter fiscal policy accommodates lower interest rates, 
in addition to limit exchange rate pressures and moderating the boom. In a closed economy, 
an  increase  in  interest  rates  could  stop  the  credit  expansion  and  avert  collateral  effects. 
However, in a small open economy subject to strong capital inflows, raising the interest rate 
in an attempt to stop the credit expansion may end up encouraging further capital inflows and 
currency appreciation, without obvious effects on the volume of credit. 
On  the  other  hand,  if  the  exuberance  that  induced  capital  inflows  is  due  to  local  credit 
effervescence, it becomes necessary to adopt macro-prudential measures to limit risk taking. 
Actually,  an  important  area  of  interest  in  the  design  of  post-crisis  policies  has  been  the 
creation of buffers and other mechanisms to limit the procyclicality of financial systems. 
Foreign exchange intervention 
On  top  of  the  aforementioned  argument,  specific  measures  to  confront  stress  episodes  in 
international financial markets and processes of massive capital inflows cannot be ruled out, 
if  we  observe  that  there  is  no  additional  room  on  the  fiscal  or  monetary  side  or  that  the 
macro-prudential instruments are not enough. 
In exceptional situations, it is possible to resort to foreign exchange interventions to stabilize 
potential  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  and  lending  conditions  caused  by  massive  capital

inflows.  However,  it  should  be  emphasized  that  in  the  context  of  a  floating  exchange  rate 
regime, such intervention must be used only in exceptional cases. Its reiterative use would 
make it loose effectiveness as a stabilizing tool, in addition to eroding the hedging incentives 
I  mentioned  before.  Furthermore,  it  could  encourage  arbitrage  against  the  monetary 
authority, which could destabilize the foreign exchange market. 
A circumstance is deemed exceptional and worthy of an intervention if one can foresee an 
overreaction  in  the  foreign  exchange  market  that  is  pushing  the  real  exchange  rate 
significantly away from its fundamentals. It is important that the intervention is consistent with 
the inflationary objectives, because otherwise it might hurt the credibility of monetary policy. 
Although interventions can be either sterilized or not, the inflation targeting regime together 
with  the  exceptional  nature  of  the  intervention  means  that,  generally,  a  foreign  exchange 
intervention  must  be  sterilized.  Therefore,  monetary  policy  decisions  can  be  made 
independently  of  the  exceptional  intervention.  In  addition,  the  purpose  of  the  intervention 
should be to stabilize the foreign exchange market without pursuing a specific level for the 
exchange rate. 
In a context of capital mobility, sterilized interventions can influence the exchange rate via 
the portfolio channel and interest rate differentials. This occurs because it affects the relative 
supply  of  assets  in  domestic  currency  in  the  local  market,  signals  future  interest  rate 
movements,  or  provides  information  about  policy  makers’  perception  on  the  fundamental 
value of the exchange rate. 
In  Chile,  after  the  elimination  –  in  December  1999  –  of  the  exchange  rate  band  and  the 
adoption  of  the  inflation-targeting  regime,  the  Central  Bank  stated  that  exceptional 
circumstances may require an intervention in the foreign exchange market. Since then, the 
Central Bank has intervened on three occasions. The first time, in August 2001, the Central 
Bank announced that it might intervene at any moment from then to the end of the year. It 
also  explained  that  the  exchange  rate  was  depreciating  very  fast  and  with  great  volatility, 
which  was  cause  for  concern  in  financial  markets,  despite  the  fact  that  the  peso  was 
weakening  largely  because  of  stressful  conditions  abroad.  The  intervention  consisted  in  a 
sale of up to US$2 billion of international reserves and issuing another US$2 billion in dollar-
indexed bonds. The final intervention amounted to a sale of slightly above US$800 million 
and the full issuance of bonds. The second time, in October 2002, the Bank announced a 
similar  package,  as  it  considered  that  the  depreciation  reflected  an  overreaction,  high 
volatility and a liquidity shortage. US$1.50 billion were issued in exchange rate indexed debt 
and  no  reserves  were  sold.  The  third  time,  in  April  2008,  because  of  the  high  global 
uncertainty, the Bank decided to increase its holdings of reserves, while recognizing that, at 
the time of the announcement, the exchange rate was appreciated relative to its long-term 
fundamentals.  The  intervention  consisted  in  daily  purchases  of  US$50  million  intended  to 
accumulate  US$8  billion  in  eight  months.  The  outburst  of  the  global  financial  collapse  in 
September  2008  made  us  suspend  these  measures.  The  evidence  at  hand  indicates  that 
these  interventions  had  an  immediate  impact  on  the  exchange  rate  of  around  3%,  but  on 
some occasions they also altered its later trend. 
In Latin America, the hoarding of reserves has been used several times. In the first half of the 
1990s it was used to deal with strong capital inflows; in the 2000s it has been used much 
more frequently (figure 8). 
Intervening the foreign exchange market via reserve accumulation also serves the purpose 
of  improving  the  international  liquidity  position,  which  is  a  form  of  self-insurance  against 
external financial turmoil. Today other forms of insurance are available, that are more cost-
effective.  For  example,  this  is  the  case  of  contingent  credit  lines  of  the  IMF  or  hedging 
instruments  to  hedge  against  fluctuations  in  the  terms  of  trade  (Borensztein  et  al.,  2009; 
Caballero,  2009).  But  the  estimated  benefits  of  these  forms  of  insurance  vis-à-vis  self-
insurance through reserve accumulation do not consider the fact that this latter option has 
also a stabilizing effect on the exchange rate, because the accumulation is done at a time 
when the exchange rate is overly appreciated with respect to its fundamentals. Furthermore, 
one can think that the presence of efficient insurance mechanisms may exacerbate capital

inflows during boom periods in emerging economies. Therefore, these are instruments that 
can  prove  beneficial  in  critical  times,  but  may  create  some  inconveniences  in  normal  or 
favorable periods. 
Some economies have adopted regimes where limited interventions are applied with some 
frequency. Nonetheless, larger interventions, which are precisely the ones that may have a 
substantial effect on foreign exchange markets, entail quasi-fiscal costs that must be taken 
into  account.  This  is  another  reason  to  make  these  interventions  only  in  exceptional 
circumstances. 
Controls on capital inflows 
If  capital  inflows  are  believed  to  cause  trouble,  one  solution  is  to  limit  them  by  applying 
controls. This can be done in economies whose financial systems are not well-developed. As 
the economy and its financial systems develop, limiting capitals becomes more complex and 
ineffective,  in  particular  due  to  difficulties  in  discriminating  which  types  of  flows  should  be 
curtailed.  Also,  in  economies  with  high  levels  of  international  assets  such  as  Chile,  it  is 
difficult to control capital inflows because of the need to distinguish between inflows by non-
residents and repatriation of capital by residents. 
In the 1990s, before adopting the current monetary and exchange rate regimes, the Central 
Bank  of  Chile  imposed  controls  on  capital  inflows  together  with  a  gradual  liberalization  of 
capital  outflows.  The  main  instrument  used  to  limit  inflows  was  the  reserve  requirement, 
whereby a fraction (initially, 20%) of capital inflows had to be deposited in a Central Bank 
account bearing no interest. The stated purpose of this policy was to reduce net inflows by 
increasing related costs, and stop the appreciation of the peso, as a competitive exchange 
rate was thought to be a key factor in the successful economic recovery since the mid-1980s. 
The  reserve  requirement  would  also  favor  the  independence  of  monetary  policy  in  the 
context of an exchange rate managed within a band. Finally, the reserve requirement was 
also intended to reduce short-term capital inflows and thus limit financial vulnerability. This 
measured was introduced in June 1991 with a rate of 20% that was raised to 30% in 1992. It 
was subsequently lowered to 10% in June 1998 and further down to 0% in September of the 
same year. 
Empirical evidence indicates that the reserve requirement had a small, short-lived effect on 
interest rates, probably because agents adjusted their portfolios toward longer maturities and 
found their way around the measure (Cowan and De Gregorio, 2007). The effect on volumes 
was also small, around 2% of GDP, with total capital inflows that amounted to nearly 27% of 
GDP in the period 1991–1997. No material effects have been perceived on the real exchange 
rate. 
Where  a  significant  effect  did  occur  was  in  the  composition  of  total  inflows:  the  share  of 
short-term  debt  dropped  dramatically  as  a  percentage  of  total  debt.  However,  financial 
fragility was not completely eliminated. Severe speculative attacks against the peso in 1998 
showed that the reserve requirement policy did not isolate the economy from global financial 
turbulences (figure 9). Lastly, it is possible to contend that the reserve requirement did have 
significant  distributive  effects,  because  large  firms  continued  to  access  the  international 
bonds  market  directly  to  obtain  long-term  funding,  while  smaller  firms  could  only  access 
short-term banking loans, which were made more costly due to the reserve requirement. 
It is hard to conceive a general rule governing the use of capital controls to deal with massive 
capital  inflows,  but  it  is  certainly  more  difficult  to  apply  such  controls  in  economies  highly 
integrated to the world markets. Something that the evidence seems to suggest is that capital 
controls affect mainly the composition of the flows, not necessarily their magnitude. In that 
case,  in  order  to  affect  the  composition  of  international  liabilities,  in  particular  those 
intermediated  by  the  banking  sector,  it  would  be  more  efficient  to  direct  the  eye  toward 
financial regulation rather than to capital controls. In addition, macro-prudential regulations 
should be used to mitigate the procyclicality of capital flows. These measures could include

financial  systems  are 
Final remarks 
To  conclude,  we  must  first  emphasize  that  global  financial  integration  entails  extensive 
benefits, as it allows to smooth expenditure fluctuations and to obtain resources to finance 
investments in countries with capital shortage. However, we have also learned that capital 
flows  can  be  destabilizing,  particularly  when 
fragile  and 
macroeconomic  policies  inconsistent.  Long-lasting  boom  periods  have  always  presented 
challenges to macroeconomic policy making.  
Sadly, the passing from economic boom to a costly recession is a too recurrent experience 
for emerging economies, especially in Latin America. From a historical perspective, capital 
flows today are currently not so abundant and no imbalances of income and expenditure are 
seen that might reveal substantial misalignments. After the recessive period of 2009, slack 
remains in our economies, and tensions in the near future cannot be ruled out. It is therefore 
advisable to begin exploring the proper policy responses. In such circumstances, the first line 
of defense must be an active monetary and fiscal management, within a context of exchange 
rate flexibility and stable inflationary perspectives. This combination proved very favorable to 
maintain  macroeconomic  and  financial  stability  in  2008-2009,  and  has  the  necessary 
elements  to  also  succeed  in  dealing  with  a  potential  period  of  strong  capital  inflows  and 
appreciating exchange rate pressures. 
Additional measures, such as a foreign exchange intervention or controls on capital inflows, 
cannot be a priori ruled out, and will depend on each economy’s specific circumstances and 
characteristics. However, in implementing them it is essential that they do not become the 
cause  of  macroeconomic  imbalances  by  encouraging  massive  capital  inflows.  In  fact, 
distortions often do not originate in excessive appetite by foreigners for domestic assets, but 
in disturbances resulting from the application of inconsistent policies. 
On  the  one  hand,  exceptional  measures  cannot  be  used  as  a  substitute  for,  say,  a  more 
austere fiscal policy or a strengthening of prudential regulation and supervision of banking 
and  non-banking  entities.  On  the  other  hand,  trying  to  maintain  an  artificially  depreciated 
exchange  rate,  especially  in  contexts  of  growing  financial  integration,  can  only  foster 
speculation  and  capital  inflows,  as  it  increases  expected  appreciation.  Any  exceptional 
measure  must  be  applied  only  in  extreme  circumstances  and  for  a  limited  period  of  time, 
once every other instrument has been reasonably exhausted.
