   Yves Mersch: Making Europe’s financial market infrastructure a bulwark 
of financial stability 
Speaking points by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central 
Bank, for the  Bank  of France/Sciences  Po  research seminar “Financial stability  in  a  digital 
world”, Paris, 7 June 2016. 
 Introduction 
• 
Europe’s financial market infrastructure has proved to be resilient through bouts of 
financial market volatility; 
it has supported the liquidity and stability of financial markets in times of stress; 
the  European  Central Bank  and  the  Eurosystem,  in  conjunction  with  European 
legislators  and  market  participants,  have  made  Europe’s 
financial  market 
infrastructure into the bulwark of financial stability it is today; 
in  the  first  part  of  my  presentation,  I  will  investigate  the  potential  impact  of  the 
digitalisation of financial services on Europe’s market infrastructure; 
in  the  second  part,  I  will  outline  how  the  Eurosystem  plans  to  deal  with  the 
technological and strategic challenges which affect our market infrastructure. 
Part 1: The digitalisation of financial services and their potential impact on Europe’s 
market infrastructure 
• 
Technical innovations in financial services will be among the key focal points for the 
Eurosystem over the next few years; 
In my article, I address four key topics where innovation in financial services will have 
to be tackled in the coming years: 
pan-European instant payments; 
person-to-person mobile payments; 
the emergence of new (non-bank) service providers; 
distributed ledger technology (DLT). 
Pan-European instant payments 
In 2015, the Euro Retail Payments Board invited the European Payments Council to 
develop an instant payment scheme for euro payments based on the SEPA credit 
transfer; 
the implementation of this scheme is foreseen by November 2017; 
By that time, end-user solutions for instant payments in euro should be made available 
at the pan-European level by the payment service providers; 
This means that by November 2017 the European financial market infrastructure has 
to be ready to clear and settle instant payments on a pan-European scale; 
As an operator of market infrastructure, the Eurosystem is exploring how to support 
the settlement of pan-European instant payments.

innovative  service 
impact  the  underlying  financial  market 
Person-to-person mobile payments 
Another 
infrastructure is person-to-person (P2P) mobile payments; 
One  key  component  of  pan-European  P2P  mobile  payments  is  the  so-called 
standardised proxy lookup (SPL) service; 
This is a database service that can link the mobile number of the payment recipient 
to the IBAN; 
this would greatly add to the convenience of mobile payments as it would free users 
from having to know and use the IBANs of the payment recipients; 
Such database services are already available at the national level; 
the Euro Retail Payments Board has called on the market to develop a pan-European 
solution. 
new (non-bank) market entrants 
the digitalisation of financial services opened the doors for a wave of new market 
entrants; 
there are two categories of new market entrants; 
first, there are start-ups making use of new information technology applied to financial 
services (“FinTech” companies); 
second,  there  are  established  internet  companies  (large  US  social  media  or  e-
commerce platforms); 
In most cases, they do not offer banking services other than the initiation of payments 
or access to account information; 
these new product and service providers might present a challenge to the traditional 
market incumbents’ revenue streams; 
their impact on the underlying financial market infrastructure will be more limited as 
the clearing and settlement of payments and securities transactions still take place 
between the account-holding entities. 
distributed ledger technology (DLT) 
What may have a much more profound impact on the financial market infrastructure 
in the years to come is distributed ledger technology (DLT); 
DLT allows the verification of financial transactions in a decentralised way; 
Thus, they have the potential to reshape the mechanisms for making transactions; 
the Eurosystem needs to reflect on the possible impact and use of DLT in its three 
capacities as operator, catalyst and overseer; 
as the discussion on DLT is proceeding at great pace, I would like to point out that in 
the meantime, we have established an organisational structure within the ECB and 
launched dedicated work streams on DLT around the central bank roles of operator, 
catalyst and overseer in the field of market infrastructures: 
[operator role:] 
• 
we study the potential impact on the Eurosystem market infrastructure, i.e. TARGET2 
and T2S;

     work is conducted in the context of our strategic reflections around “Vision 2020”, on 
which I will elaborate in a minute; 
adopting DLT for the Eurosystem’s market infrastructure would obviously imply that 
central bank money is transacted via DLT; this may have implications on the central 
bank functions which go beyond the operational and technical sphere; therefore, it is 
important to structure the discussion along the lines of who could access the central 
bank ledger. 
[catalyst role:] 
• 
in order to avoid DLT silos and jeopardizing market integration achievements, we also 
attach great importance to standardisation and interoperability both in the payments 
and in the post-trade domain; 
we very much welcome the ongoing industry’s efforts in these areas and have already 
offered our support in facilitating this market-driven process. 
[oversight role:] 
• 
in  our  capacity  as  overseer  of  market  infrastructures,  we  need  to keep abreast of 
market  developments  in  the  FinTech  arena  and  study  the  appropriateness  of  our 
oversight framework with a view to ensuring efficiency and safety. 
Part 2: The Eurosystem’s vision for 2020 
• 
for 
infrastructure 
To deal with the technological and strategic challenges to its market infrastructure, 
the Eurosystem has developed three key action points it will work on in the run up to 
2020; 
The  first  is  to  explore  synergies  between  TARGET2  and  T2S,  potentially  even 
merging  them  into  a  single  platform  in  the  future,  with  the  goal  of  achieving  a 
consolidated  market 
large-value  payments  and  securities 
settlement; 
The enhancements envisaged for Europe’s financial market infrastructure will benefit 
users by providing access to all available services via a single gateway; 
Moreover,  these  enhancements  will  provide  an  opportunity  to  further  increase  the 
resilience of the system, which is also beneficial from a financial stability perspective; 
The second action point is to consider new service opportunities that the closer 
integration of TARGET2 and T2S would bring; 
in particular, the Eurosystem is considering enhancing the TARGET2 services with 
instant payments, at least in the settlement layer; 
Third, there are plans to review the harmonisation of Eurosystem arrangements and 
procedures for collateralisation; 
The  three  action  points  are  currently  in  the  design  phase,  and  it  is  expected  that 
decisions on the actual implementation of the projects will be taken over the summer; 
For  all  three  action  points,  the  Eurosystem  will  continue  to  work  closely  with  the 
market in order to benefit from its knowledge and experience as well as to ensure that 
Europe’s future financial market infrastructure fully meets the needs of its users. 
         Conclusion 
• 
the Eurosystem is not only helping to create a more integrated financial market but is 
also  contributing  to  greater  financial  stability  by  ensuring  a  strong  and  efficient 
European market infrastructure;

  Looking to the future, the Eurosystem remains committed to these objectives and will 
seek  to  exploit  technological  advances  and  innovation  while  maintaining  safety, 
reliability and, ultimately, confidence and stability.
