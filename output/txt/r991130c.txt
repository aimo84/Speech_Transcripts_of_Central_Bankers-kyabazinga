Mr Schieber takes a look at European monetary policy
 under the sign of the euro
Lecture delivered by Mr Helmut Schieber, Member of the Directorate of the Deutsche Bundesbank, in
the  context  of  the  function  “Germany  –  Powerhouse  for  Europe’s  Capital  Market?”,  organized  by
Finanzplatz e.V. (Frankfurt), held in New York on 22 November 1999.
 I
I am delighted to have been invited to speak to you in the context of this function. It is, I believe, a
rare privilege for a central banker to feature as a speaker at what is – ultimately – a marketing event. A
well-known US central banker once said, however, that it is, in principle, always a mistake to invite a
central  banker  as  one’s  speaker,  since  he  is  not  allowed  to  say  anything  that  is  of  interest  to  his
audience, while the audience mostly already knows everything that he is allowed to say. Today I shall
try to get round that dilemma as best I can.
The launch of the euro - a milestone on the way to European integration
Figure 1
The euro is a new currency which has superseded the old currencies in 11 of the 15
Member States of the European Union.
11 sovereign states, while retaining national responsibility for their fiscal and general
economic policies, have set up a supranational central bank which bears the sole
responsibility for the common monetary policy.
The launch of the euro is associated with both political and economic expectations:
politically speaking, with hopes of favourable repercussions on European integration; in
economic terms, with hopes of further progress towards the enhancement of the
common market through the disappearance of exchange risk and the intensification of
competition.
The launch of the euro for 11 Member States of the European Union constitutes the most far-reaching
change in the international monetary order since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1973.
For  the  first  time,  11  sovereign  states  bearing  continued  national  responsibility  for  their  fiscal  and
economic  policies  have  set  up  a  supranational  central  bank  bearing  the  sole  responsibility  for  their
common monetary policy.
The launch of the euro has aroused both political and economic expectations: politically speaking, the
transition  to  the  single  currency  marks  a  further  –  consistent  –  milestone  on  the  road  to  European
integration. In the meantime, the European Union comprises 15 Member States (the United Kingdom,
Denmark, Sweden and Greece have failed to join the monetary union – for very different reasons); 12
other European states are seeking admission to the EU. In economic terms, it is hoped that the launch
of the euro will likewise yield substantial benefits: it is anticipated that the disappearance of exchange
risk  within  the  Eurosystem  and  the  intensification  of  competition  in  the  European  financial,
BIS Review 130/1999

merchandise  and  services  markets  will  have  a favourable impact  on the further  enhancement  of the
common market.
Don’t let  yourselves  be confused by  the  fact  that the  old  currencies,  such  as  the  Deutsche  Mark  or
French  franc, are  still in  circulation in  the  11  euro countries.  Euro banknotes  and  coins  will  not  be
launched until the year 2002 because of the immense logistical trouble it will cause.
Actually, in statutory and economic terms, the euro is already the sole currency in the eurozone; the
old  currencies are  –  as  we  say  in the jargon  – nothing  but  the  “non-decimal  denominations”  of  the
euro.
At this juncture, I have no wish to bore you unduly with figures. As regards the dimensions of the euro
monetary area, it is enough to say that, in terms of their population and economic performance, the
eurozone and the United States are roughly comparable (290 million EMU Europeans compare with
270 million US Americans; in terms of economic performance, the euro area, accounting for 15% of
global GDP, is second only to the USA, at 20%).
The  statutory  and  institutional  prerequisites  of  the  euro  are  laid  down  in  what  is  known  as  the
Maastricht Treaty.

The European System of Central Banks (“Eurosystem”)
Figure 2
European Central Bank (ECB)
   11 national central banks
Primary objective: maintenance of price stability, accompanied by independence
from instructions from government institutions (the general
economic policy of the Community is endorsed only insofar as
the primacy of the objective of price stability is not in jeopardy).
According to that Treaty, the so-called “Eurosystem” consists of the European Central Bank and the
national central banks of the 11 Member States. Hence the Deutsche Bundesbank is integrated in the
Eurosystem, rather than sunk – a small but significant distinction. I am not addressing you today as
one of the last representatives of a species doomed to extinction.
The  primary  objective  of  the  Eurosystem  is  the  maintenance  of  price  stability.  That  institution  is
independent  of  instructions  from  government  bodies.  It  is  required  to  support  the  Community’s
general  economic  policy  only  insofar  as  that  is  possible  without  endangering  the  objective  of  price
stability. That is a not entirely insignificant difference from the duties assigned to the Fed system.
BIS Review 130/1999

The decision-making bodies of the Eurosystem are the Governing Council and the Executive Board.
The  Governing  Council,  comprising  six  members  of  the  Executive  Board  of  the  ECB  and  11
Governors of the national central banks, formulates the monetary policy of the Community.

Task of the Governing Council:
Formulation of the monetary policy of the Community.
Task of the Executive Board and the national central banks:
Implementation of monetary policy in accordance with the guidelines and decisions
laid down by the Governing Council.
The  principle  of  subsidiarity,  as  defined  in  the  Treaty,  is  likewise  important.  According  to  that
principle, the European Central Bank is required to avail itself of the services of the national central
banks to execute transactions, insofar as that seems possible and appropriate. In practice, operational
transactions are almost all conducted by the national central banks.
The monetary constitutions of the ESCB and the Deutsche Bundesbank show distinct parallels. The
primacy  of  the  maintenance  of  price  stability  is  common  to  both  systems,  as  is  the  high  degree  of
monetary autonomy and the decentralized execution of duties.

The Governing Council has defined its primary objective, namely that of maintaining price stability, in
quantitative terms. According to that definition, price stability obtains if it is ensured over the medium
term that the year-on-year rise in the harmonized consumer price index (HCPI) for the euro area is less
than 2%.
To realize the objective of price stability, a monetary policy strategy which rests on two pillars was
devised. In the first place, the Governing Council announced a reference value for the growth of the
money stock M3; secondly, a broad range of leading economic indicators is constantly being analyzed
in order to assess the prospects for price movements and the risks to price stability.
Central  bank  money  is  mainly  provided  through  open  market  operations,  a  weekly  tender  being
offered with a maturity of two weeks and a monthly one with a maturity of three months. Through the
institution  of  two  standing  facilities,  the  movement  of  the  overnight  money  rate  is  curbed  by  an
interest-rate corridor, i.e. a ceiling and a floor to the overnight money rate.
The Eurosystem also has a wide range of fine-tuning instruments. Owing to the buffer function of the
minimum reserve system, however, a comparatively steady development of the money-market rates is
assured, so that the Eurosystem has not had to intervene in the market with fine-tuning measures even
once  since  the  start  of  monetary  union.  You  can  gather  the  full  range  of  the  monetary  policy
instruments of the Eurosystem from the figure; unfortunately, I am unable to go into more detail here,
for time reasons.
In  my  opinion,  the  monetary  policy  strategy  and  arsenal  of  instruments  of  the  Eurosystem  are
convincing  and fully  in  keeping  with international  standards.  The  particular  significance  of  the  two
standing facilities is demonstrated, for instance, in connection with the Y2K problem. The marginal
lending facility sets the ceiling on the overnight money rate, since the counterparties of the ESCB can
obtain overnight liquidity on an unlimited scale against the lodging of sufficient collateral. Unless I am
much mistaken, the Fed has just set up a similar facility for the turn of the year.
III
Just under 11 months after the launch of the euro, it seems legitimate to take initial stock:
As regards domestic price stability, i.e. the movement of the inflation rate, the history of the euro has
so far been a “success story”. The rise in the harmonized consumer price index, currently at 1.2%, is
still  a  good  way  off  the  absolute  limit  of  “less  than  2%”  set  by  the  Governing  Council.  Even  so,
increased  vigilance  is  needed  here  since  a  certain  upward  pressure  on  consumer  prices  has  to  be
expected, not least on account of the steep rise in oil prices. For this reason the Governing Council of
the ECB decided at its meeting on 4 November 1999 to raise the ECB’s three main interest rates by
50 basis  points  each.  The  Governing  Council  is  convinced  that  the  timely  rise  in  interest  rates  will
avoid the need for stronger measures later; on balance the prospects for sustained price stability remain
good.
 [Figure 6] – not available
“There is no light without shadows”, says a German proverb, and that brings me to a topic which has
been  much  discussed  among  the  public  at  large,  namely  the  movement  of  the  external  value  of  the
euro:
The expectations about the positioning of the euro in the global financial markets were very  mixed.
“Euro  over-optimists”  had  reckoned  with  a  rapid  appreciation  of  the  euro  against  the  US  dollar
because they were expecting central banks, institutional investors and private investors to take early
and marked advantage of the euro in  order  to  diversify  their  portfolios,  which  often focused on  the
dollar. By contrast, “euro sceptics” drew attention to the fact that it needs a long time before a new and
untried currency is accepted as an investment, reserve and transaction currency.
BIS Review 130/1999

As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  euro  made  a  promising  start  in  the  foreign  exchange  markets,  with  a  rate
against the dollar of 1.18. But the exchange rate soon began to edge down, reaching an all-time low, at
1.0124, on 12 July.
The main reasons for this depreciation were no doubt the astonishing resilience of US business activity
and the associated distinct interest-rate advantage of the United States.
In the meantime, the reference rate of the euro against the dollar has picked up distinctly, and for some
time past  has been  moving  within a  range  of  1.03–1.09  (on  ... the  current level  is  ...). This  upward
movement  is  undoubtedly  due  to  the  improved  economic  outlook  and  rising  interest  rates  in  the
eurozone.
The  movement  of  the  external  value  of  the  euro  can  be  viewed  with  relative  composure  from  the
standpoint of a European central banker. Since the euro became the single currency of 11 European
countries,  foreign  trade  between  those  countries  has  been  conducted  without  any  exchange  risk  or
exchange-rate fluctuations.  In  other  words,  only  foreign  trade  with  non-EU  countries  is  affected  by
exchange-rate movements; hence the “openness” of the euro-area countries, i.e. their vulnerability to
exchange-rate fluctuations, has decreased significantly.
What, then, have been the repercussions of the launch of the euro on the European financial markets?

                                         certain deficits
         remain
- divergent legal systems
- cross-border settlement of securities 
  transactions sometimes poses problems
To begin with, a few words on the European money market, i.e. the direct field of operations of the
ECB.
As far as the unsecured money market is concerned, it has long been fair to speak of a single European
market. In this sector, a highly liquid market with a tight bid-ask spread and considerable transaction
volumes  evolved  very  quickly.  A  large  part  of  the  trade  between  “big  players”  is  meanwhile  being
transacted  with  counterparties  abroad;  this  trend  is  undoubtedly  being  fostered  by  the  smooth
functioning of the European payment system, TARGET.
Distinct progress towards integration has likewise been made in the secured money market. Even so,
there are still certain shortcomings here. Particular problems are posed by the coexistence of different
BIS Review 130/1999
6
legal systems, as reflected, for instance, in divergent master agreements. To cite an example, alongside
the PSA/ISMA master repo agreement customary for international transactions, there are a number of
national framework agreements, e.g. for Germany or France.
Finally, there is also a degree of friction in connection with the cross-border settlement of securities, as
a  result  of  which  particular  securities  are  being  traded  only  in  their  domestic  markets.  In  general,
however, all those concerned are faring satisfactorily as far as the European repo market is concerned:
for instance, the European Banking Association is in the process of preparing a European master repo
agreement, which will be put on the market very shortly.
Degree of integration of the European capital market
Figure 8
Bond market: largely integrated
- large-scale old issues converted
  into euro
- uniform market practices laid down 
- highly liquid
- world’s second largest bond market
  after the USA
Equity market: some progress towards
 integration, but still no
 little need for adjustment
-  segmentation of European stock markets
(but: efforts to create a pan-European
stock market)
-  national differences in corporate law, tax
law and balance-sheet law
With  reference to  the  European  capital  markets,  it  must  be  said  that  developments  in  the  bond  and
equity markets have so far diverged very markedly:
In the market for fixed interest securities, a large and liquid market came into being very quickly after
the  disappearance  of  the  price  differences  owing  to  inflation  and  exchange  rate  changes;  in  the
meantime,  the  euro  bond  market  is  the  second  largest  in  the  world,  after  the  US  bond  market.  The
main reasons for that were, firstly, the decision taken by the principal issuers not only to launch new
issues in euro, but also to convert fungible large-scale old issues into euro. Secondly, market players
had  agreed  in  the  run-up  to  monetary  union  to  standardize  their  highly  divergent  national  market
practices into internationally customary market rules and regulations.
I suppose that the formation of a single European equity market will  take  some  time.  It  is  true that
efforts  are  now  being  made  to  set  up  a  pan-European  stock  market,  so  as  at  least  to  overcome  the
pronounced segmentation of European stock markets, but national differences in underlying conditions
– meaning corporate law, tax law and balance-sheet law – constitute a serious stumbling block to that.
V
Altogether, the chances of the further auspicious development of the euro financial markets are to be
rated very favourable. The substantial progress towards integration that has already been made attests
to the rapid pace of growth of the euro area; the attractiveness of the euro to international investors and
issuers alike will probably go on increasing.
