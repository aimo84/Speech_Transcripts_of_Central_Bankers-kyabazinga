Jean-Pierre Roth: Fifteen months of financial crisis – a status report 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the 
Swiss  National  Bank  and  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Bank  for  International 
Settlements,  at  the  Associazione  Bancaria  Ticinese,  Centro  di  Studi  Bancari,  Vezia, 
3 December 2008. 
The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 The financial crisis broke out a little over fifteen months ago. The magnitude of the turmoil 
experienced  by  the  financial  industry  has  been  greater  than  all  the  forecasts.  So  far,  our 
entire  attention  has  been  focused  on  the  problems  of  the  financial  industry,  while  the  real 
economy appeared to be passing through this difficult period without too many problems. We 
now  realise  that  this  view  was  deceptive:  the  situation  in  the  non-financial  sector  is 
deteriorating substantially. This could lead to new challenges in 2009. After having benefitted 
extensively  from  the  international  expansion  of  the  past  few  years,  we  are  currently 
experiencing the consequences of a widespread recession. This situation is difficult for our 
country, but we may be better placed than others for coping with it.
