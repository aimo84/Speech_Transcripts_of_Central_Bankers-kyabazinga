Philipp Hildebrand: Financial stability 
Summary of a speech by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of 
the  Swiss  National  Bank,  at  the  Institut  des  Hautes  Etudes  Commerciales  de  Lausanne, 
Lausanne, 16 September 2008. 
The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 During  the  period  of  financial  market  turbulence,  central  banks  have  gone  far  with  their 
interventions to stabilize the financial system, taking into account the high costs that can be 
imposed by a banking crisis onto the real economy. 
Central banks by themselves, however, cannot guarantee financial stability in the long term. 
In particular, we cannot exclude that their interventions create incentives for banks to be less 
cautious in the future. The first line of defence therefore consists of banks having sound risk 
management practices and holding appropriate levels of capital and liquidity. The Financial 
Stability Forum has made a series of recommendations in this respect. 
Given  the  size  of  the  big  Swiss  banks  in  relation  to  our  national  economy,  we  should  be 
especially prudent. For this reason, the Swiss National Bank supports the project undertaken 
by  the  Swiss  Federal  Banking  Commission  (SFBC)  to  strengthen  capital  adequacy 
requirements  and  to  revise  the  liquidity  requirements  for  the  big  banks.  As  the  SFBC  has 
pointed  out on  several  occasions,  these  measures  have  to  be  implemented  gradually  –  to 
ensure that banks have sufficient time to adapt. These measures will contribute to the solidity 
and credibility of the Swiss financial centre. This will strengthen its position as a global leader 
in wealth management.
