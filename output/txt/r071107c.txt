Nicholas C Garganas: Does one size fit all? Monetary policy and 
integration in the euro area 
Address  by  Mr  Nicholas  C  Garganas,  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Greece,  at  a  visit  to  the 
Central Bank of Chile, Santiago, 12 October 2007. 
 The euro has created a new reality for 318 million Europeans and has probably become the 
most  visible  symbol  of  European  integration.  Its  introduction  was  in  itself  a  remarkable 
achievement, representing the culmination of a process of convergence and integration that 
began  many  years  ago.  However,  the  introduction  of  the  euro  did  not  mark  the  end  of 
European  economic  integration.  Instead,  the  euro  created  new  challenges  for  monetary 
policy. I want to focus on two of those challenges in my presentation: 
• 
First, how would the newly-created European Central bank build credibility? Here, I 
will argue that the adoption of a credible monetary policy strategy and its systematic 
implementation would be crucial. 
Second, does the single monetary policy fit the particular circumstances in each of 
the  countries  of  the  euro  area?  In  addressing  this  question,  I  will  argue  that  the 
traditional  way  of  thinking  about  what  constitutes  an  optimum  currency  area 
overlooks  the  fact  that  the  criteria  used  to  judge  optimality  are,  to  some  extent, 
endogenous.  In  particular,  I  will  argue  that  the  creation  of  a  monetary  union  can 
itself create conditions that are favourable to the well-functioning of the union. 
 The ECB’s monetary policy strategy and its implementation 
I. 
The monetary policy strategy – which was initially adopted in 1998 and confirmed with a few 
clarifications in 2003 – drew on decades of central bank policy experience and the strategies 
of the most successful (in terms of inflation performance) central banks in the euro area. The 
strategy includes three key elements. 
First,  there  is  the  objective  of  price  stability.  The  view  that  monetary  policy  can  contribute 
most  to  economic  welfare  by  maintaining  price  stability  is  supported  by  a  large  body  of 
empirical  evidence.  Ultimately,  monetary  policy  can  influence  only  the  price  level  and  can 
have  no  lasting  influence  on  real  variables.  Price  stability  is  defined  as  a  year-on-year 
increase in consumer prices for the euro area of “below, but close to, 2 per cent”. The “close 
to”  was  added  in  2003  to  establish  a  safety  margin  above  zero  inflation  to  guard  against 
deflationary risks. In the light of the long lags involved in the transmission of monetary policy, 
price stability is to be maintained in the medium term. 
Second, there are the “two pillars” of economic and monetary analyses.  
• 
The economic analysis focuses mainly on the assessment of current economic and 
financial  developments  from  the  perspective  of  the  interplay  between  supply  and 
demand  in  the  product  and  factor  markets,  and  provides  short-  to  medium-term 
indications of inflation. 
The  monetary  analysis,  which  acts  as  a  cross-check  to  the  economic  analysis, 
focuses  on  money  and  credit  developments  in  recognition  of  empirical  evidence 
suggesting  that  monetary  growth  and  inflation  tend  to  be  closely  related  in  the 
medium to long run. 
 The  third  element  in  the  strategy  is  central  bank  independence,  counterbalanced  by 
accountability and transparency. The Maastricht Treaty granted full political independence to 
the ECB in its pursuit of price stability. When exercising their duties, neither the ECB nor the 
BIS Review 126/2007 
 1
National Central Banks, nor any member of their decision-making bodies, is allowed to seek 
or  receive  instructions  from  EU  or  member-state  institutions.  Long  terms  of  office  for 
members of the Governing Council, who serve on the Council in a personal capacity, and a 
rule  that  members  of  the  Executive  Board  cannot  be  reappointed,  also  contribute  to 
minimizing potential political influences on members of the ECB’s decision-making bodies. 
In a democratic society, however, central bank independence needs to be counterbalanced 
by accountability, that is, an obligation on the part of the central bank to explain its decisions 
to  the  public  and  its  elected  representatives.  In  turn,  accountability  requires  transparency 
with respect both to objectives and decision-making. To this end, monetary policy decisions 
taken by the ECB are explained “in real time” at a press conference immediately after each 
rate-setting Governing Council meeting. 
The  ECB’s  record  over  the  past  nine  years  has  been  a  positive  one.  It  has  delivered  low 
levels of inflation, inflation expectations and long-term interest rates. Average inflation in the 
euro area since its inception has been 2.03 percent, a shade higher than the ECB’s definition 
of  price  stability,  notwithstanding  significant  price  shocks  stemming  mainly  from  oil  price 
increases. Inflation expectations have also been remarkably close to the ECB’s definition of 
price stability and long-term interest rates have been at historically low levels for a significant 
period  since  the  formation  of  the  monetary  union.  The  anchoring  of  expectations  clearly 
attests to the ECB’s credibility.

By maintaining low inflation and securing long-term inflation expectations at levels consistent 
with  price  stability,  the  ECB  makes  its  best  possible  contribution  to  supporting  sustained 
economic  growth  and  employment  creation.  The  stability-oriented  policies  have  supported 
both households, by maintaining the purchasing power of their income and savings, and the 
business sector, by creating an environment of low and stable interest rates, conducive to 
investment.

Does one size fit all? 
II.  
While the success of the monetary union in delivering low inflation and a credible currency is 
beyond dispute, the issue of whether a single monetary policy can “fit” all member states of 
the euro area, continues to be hotly debated. 
EMU: an optimum – currency – area perspective  
i)  
EMU brought unique challenges for monetary policy. Critical observers took the view that a 
single monetary policy was doomed to failure because the euro area does not fulfill the pre-
requisites of an Optimum Currency Area (OCA). This implies that if national economies are 
affected by asymmetric exogenous shocks or if shocks are transmitted to different degrees in 
different economies, because of unique economic and institutional characteristics in national 
economies, the mechanisms which could temper their impact either do not exist or are not 
strong. 
BIS Review 126/2007

It is certainly true that the euro area is characterized by a lack of labour mobility, because of 
linguistic and cultural differences. There is also an absence of a significant centralized fiscal 
transfer mechanism. In these circumstances, so the argument goes, shocks are likely to lead 
to  widening  inflation  differentials  so  that  a  common  nominal  interest  rate  in  the  monetary 
union  results  in  diverging  real  interest  rates  among  countries.  For  member  countries  with 
relatively-strong  domestic  demand  and  a  higher-than-average  inflation  rate,  the  lower  real 
interest  rate  fuels  domestic  demand  and  national  inflation.  Conversely,  for  countries  with 
relatively-weak  domestic  demand  and  a  lower-than-average  inflation  rate,  the  high  real 
interest rates put further downward pressures on domestic demand and inflation. A one-size 
monetary policy, in other words, does not fit all. 
The foregoing, traditional view of optimum currency area is static in nature. It assumes that a 
country’s  characteristics,  such  as  its  degree  of  trade  integration,  are  immutable.  The 
experience of the euro area, however, suggests that participation in a monetary union may 
itself  induce  changes  in  economic  structure  and  performance.  Indeed,  a  good  deal  of 
academic  research,  much  of  it  reflecting  the  experience  of  the  European  monetary  union, 
also  indicates  that  the  creation  of  a  monetary  union  can  itself  create  conditions  that  are 
favorable to the well-functioning of the union.1  
The experience of the euro area has demonstrated that a common currency can affect an 
economy’s  characteristics  through  at  least  two  channels.  These  channels  operate  through 
enhanced credibility, and trade and financial integration. In what follows, I will discuss each 
of these channels in turn. 
How does the credibility channel work? A major benefit of participating in EMU, especially for 
countries  such  as  Greece,  Italy,  Portugal,  and  Spain  that  have  had  recent  histories  of 
relatively-high  inflation  rates,  has  been  the  credibility  gain  derived  from  eliminating  the 
inflationary bias of discretionary monetary policy. Since there is no devaluation risk, and no 
need of an interest rate premium to cover the risk of devaluation, nominal and real interest 
rates  are  lower  than  otherwise.  Low  and  stable  inflation  and  inflationary  expectations 
lengthen  economic  horizons,  encouraging  a  transformation  of  both  the  financial  and  real 
sectors. 
Let  me  now  turn  to  the  trade-creation  effects  of  a  common  currency.  Recent  empirical 
evidence  has  shown  that  a  common  currency  (as  opposed  to  separate  currencies  tied 
together with fixed exchange rates) can also promote trade2. The basic intuition underlying 
this  view  is  that  a  set  of  national  currencies  is  a  significant  barrier  to  trade.  In  addition  to 
removing the costs of currency conversion, a single currency and a common monetary policy 
preclude  future  competitive  devaluations,  and  facilitate  foreign  direct  investment  and  the 
building of long-term relationships. These outcomes, in turn, can promote (over-and-above 
what may have been attained on the basis of the elimination of exchange-rate uncertainty 
among  separate  currencies)  reciprocal  trade,  economic  and  financial  integration,  and  the 
accumulation  of  knowledge.  Greater  trade  integration  can  increase  growth  by  increasing 
allocative efficiency and accelerating the transfer of knowledge. 
The euro-area’s experience indicates that the euro has indeed acted as a catalyst for trade 
integration. Intra-euro area trade in goods increased from 26% of euro area GDP in 1998 to 
33% in 2006. Intra-area trade in services has also risen. Recent empirical work has shown 
that similar increases in trade have not taken place among European countries which did not 
adopt the euro3.

The euro has also had a positive effect on intra-euro area FDI. Between 1999 and 2005 (the 
latest data available) the stock of intra-euro area FDI more than doubled, from around 14 per 
cent of euro area GDP to over 30 per cent. 
Increased  trade  integration,  along  with  growing  intra-euro  area  FDI  flows,  lead  to  more 
highly-correlated business cycles because they increase the incidence of common demand 
shocks  and  result  in  more  intra-industry  trade.  As  a  consequence,  the  need  for  country-
specific monetary policies is reduced.

There are additional reasons that a monetary union reduces the incidence of country-specific 
shocks. One of the principal causes of asymmetric shocks − divergent monetary policies − 
no longer exists. Furthermore, it is to be expected that deeper financial market integration will 
also entail a convergence in the transmission mechanism of monetary impulses. 
The  introduction  of  the  euro  has  helped  make  the  euro  area  financial  markets  more 
integrated.  The  money  market  has  been  almost  perfectly  integrated  since  the  formation  of 
monetary union. The significant growth of the euro corporate bond market, while still smaller 
than  its  US  counterpart,  also  provides  evidence  of  integration  and  widens  the  range  of 
potential  investors  to  which  firms  have  access.  National  bonds  and  equity  market  returns 
exhibit  closer  co-movements  than  they  did  prior  to  the  introduction  of  the  euro,  offering 
investors the opportunity to diversify their holdings and reduce the risks for a given level of 
return. The main area where financial integration has lagged is that of retail banking where, 
in  spite  of  an  increase  in  cross-border  M&As  in  recent  year,  cross-border  activity  remains 
relatively limited.

Forces for further integration will continue, as market participants increasingly exploit the new 
environment  of  monetary  union.  In  addition,  a  number  of  initiatives,  supported  by  the 
Eurosystem and/or the Commission, will help increase integration. An example is TARGET2, 
the new payment platform for the financial system, which is expected to begin operating in 
November  2007.  As  integration  proceeds,  we  can  expect  that  the  monetary  transmission 
mechanisms across the euro area will continue to converge, helping the implementation of 
the single monetary policy. 
To  the  extent  that  countries  nevertheless  continue  to  experience  asymmetric  shocks  or 
asymmetric responses to common shocks, financial integration can help members of a union 
insure  against  the  effects  of  such  shocks  by  providing  opportunities  for  diversification  of 
income sources and adjustments of wealth portfolios. In effect, the members can mitigate the 
effects of shocks by insuring one another through their holdings of financial claims on each 
other’s output in financial markets. 
Inflation and growth differentials  
ii) 
Despite the increased trade and financial integration in the euro area, the fact remains that 
divergences in economic performance continue to exist. How significant are these, and how 
concerned should we be?  
Recent evidence, provided by the ECB, shows that, over the period 1990-99, the euro area 
experienced  a  downward  trend  in  the  degree  of  inflation  dispersion  −  measured  as  the 
standard deviation of that dispersion − from about 6 percentage points in the early 1990s to a 
low of less than one percentage point in the second half of 1999. Since that time, inflation 
dispersion  has  changed  very  little  −  and  for  some  time  now  it  has  been  less  than  a 
percentage point.

Another fact worth emphasizing is that inflation dispersion in the euro area does not differ 
that much from dispersion across a similarly-sized monetary union, that of the US. Where the 
euro  area  does  differ  from  the  US,  however,  is  that  the  observed  differentials  seem  to  be 
more  persistent  in  the  euro  area.  In  part,  persistence  can  be  explained  by  the  so-called 
Balassa-Samuelson effect, according to which long-term differentials in regional inflation are 
attributable to differences in the rate at which productivity increases in the various regions’ 
tradable and non-tradable goods sectors. This situation represents an equilibrium adjustment 
process that does not, in principle, require economic policy correction. Indeed, differentials 
arising from this source importantly do not lead to a permanent worsening of the competitive 
position of the country experiencing the higher inflation. 
However,  given  the  degree  of  convergence  in  living  standards  experienced  by  euro  area 
countries over the last decade or so, it is difficult not to conclude that the contribution of the 
Balassa-Samuelson  effect  to  inflation  differentials  now  is  likely  to  be  relatively  small.  This 
may well give cause for concern since it suggests that the differentials originate from the fact 
that adjustment mechanisms in the euro area are not functioning as smoothly as they might 
and that policies other than monetary policy are not consistent with inflation rates close to the 
euro area average. Thus, other factors are contributing to the inflation differentials within the 
euro  area,  including  misaligned  fiscal  policies,  wage  dynamics  not  linked  to  productivity 
developments (something reflected in the significantly different rates of growth in unit labour 
costs across the union), and structural inefficiencies such as rigidities in product and factor

It  is  important  to  note  that  the  process  of  nominal  convergence  from  the  early  1990s 
onwards, which culminated in the adoption of the euro, was not accompanied by a greater 
dispersion of real GDP growth rates. Nor has dispersion increased following the adoption of 
the single currency. If any trend is discernable, it is a slight downward one, with dispersion 
remaining close to its historical average of around 2 percentage points, which is no greater 
than  that  found  in  the  US.  Moreover,  inflation  and  growth  across  the  euro  area  appear  to 
move  together.  Those  countries  with  higher  than  average  inflation  rates  (Ireland,  Greece, 
Spain, for example) appear to have higher growth rates. This suggests that, to the extent that 
inflation differentials do not reflect differences in growth rates of productivity, the dampening 
effect  of  loss  in  competitiveness  has  been  offset  by  other  factors,  such  as  interest  rate 
decreases  in  the  period  up  to  the  adoption  of  the  euro,  inflows  of  EU  structural  funds, 
immigration  and  financial  liberalization.  These  favourable  factors  are  unlikely  to  persist 
indefinitely and, once they diminish, the consequences of falling competitiveness are more 
likely to become a dominant determinant of actual growth outcomes.

Conclusions 
III.  
A single-size monetary policy has worked extremely well in the euro area. I have argued that 
this is partly the result of endogenous changes brought about by the very existence of the 
monetary  union.  Increased  trade  and  financial  integration,  spurred  on  by  the  common 
currency, have contributed to making the euro area closer to an optimum currency area. In 
addition,  the  credibility  of  the  ECB’s  monetary  policy  has  delivered  low  interest  rates  and 
price stability. 
Yet  these  are  not  sufficient  alone  to  increase economic  growth  and  raise  living  standards. 
Low  interest  rates  and  a  stable  price  level  provide  the  fabric  upon  which  a  more  dynamic 
Europe can be woven. Whilst endogenous responses by the private sector to the creation of 
monetary union can contribute to the necessary increases in flexibility in product and labour 
markets, there is also a need for countries themselves to adopt measures in this direction. 
Between  2001  and  2005,  euro  area  growth  was  relatively  weak.  Moreover,  in  spite  of 
declines in the dispersion of inflation rates and growth rates, their persistence raised some 
concerns in terms of the competitiveness of certain countries within the euro area. 
In  these  circumstances,  some  countries  (the  most  prominent  example  being  Germany) 
undertook structural reforms, the fruits of which began to be seen in the second half of 2004.

Thus euro area unemployment has fallen sharply, reaching its lowest level since the start of 
monetary  union.  Although  this  outcome  reflects,  in  part,  a  cyclical  rebound,  part  of  the 
decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  may  well  be  due  to  the  impact  of  structural  reforms. 
However,  structural  impediments  continue  to  exist  in  the  euro  area;  they  help  explain  still 
high  levels  of  unemployment  and  low  participation  rates.  Further  reforms  can  only  foster 
economic growth and create additional employment opportunities. 
Fiscal  developments  in  the  euro  area  have  also  been  favorable  in  recent  years.  However, 
budgetary  improvement  has  largely  been  the  result  of  strong  output  growth  and  revenue 
windfalls. Only a small part has been due to policy measures. Against the background of the 
current economic expansion, it is essential to sustain the momentum toward improving public 
finances  and  to  accelerate  the  pace  of  fiscal  consolidation.  This  would  strengthen  the 
capacity  of  the  euro  area  to  adjust  to  external  shocks,  increase  consumer  and  investor 
confidence, and hence support growth and employment. 
To conclude, the euro area has indeed come a long way. The success of the single currency 
has demonstrated that one size can fit all. Such has been the success of the euro area that it 
has given rise to considerations, still at an early stage, of regional currency arrangements in 
Africa, Asia and Latin America. Nevertheless, much more needs to be done to ensure that 
the  euro  area  becomes  a  more  dynamic  force  for  growth  in  the  global  economy  on  a 
sustainable basis. It is my view that the experience of the euro area to date only serves to 
highlight the fact that a currency union requires more flexibility in factor and product markets, 
and  greater  competition  than  do  independent  monetary  areas.  Flexible  markets  and  strict 
fiscal rules are not just superfluous conditions for members of a monetary union. They are 
necessities that make monetary union work by providing the adjustment mechanisms that the 
one size fits all monetary policy cannot.
