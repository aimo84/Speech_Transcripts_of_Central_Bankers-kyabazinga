Daniel K Tarullo: Dodd-Frank Act Implementation 
Testimony  by  Mr  Daniel  K  Tarullo,  Member  of  the  Board  of  Governors  of  the  Federal 
Reserve System, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, US Senate, 
Washington DC, 6 December 2011. 
 Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Shelby, and other members of the committee, thank 
you for the opportunity to testify on the Federal Reserve s implementation of the Dodd-Frank 
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act).  
The Federal Reserve s approach to Dodd-Frank implementation 
Needless  to  say,  implementation  of  the  Dodd-Frank  Act  has  been,  and  continues  to  be,  a 
formidable  task.  At  the  Federal  Reserve,  hundreds  of  staff  members  are  contributing  to 
Dodd-Frank projects. We have issued 29 final rules, public notices, and reports already and 
we have another 13 rules underway. All told, we expect the Board will issue approximately 
60 sets of rules and formal guidelines as part of its implementation efforts. We are working 
diligently  to  complete  the  remaining  rules.  The  challenge  arises  from  the  sheer  number  of 
studies,  rules,  and  other  implementation  tasks  the  Act  requires  the  Federal  Reserve  to 
produce in a relatively short period of time. Moreover, much of the work involves the more 
time-consuming process of joint rulemakings or coordination with other agencies, all of which 
are facing similar demands.  
For  all  the  variation  and  complexity  in  our  Dodd-Frank  implementation  responsibilities,  we 
have several unifying goals.  
First and foremost, we want to get it right. This means implementing the statute faithfully, in a 
manner that maximizes financial stability and other social benefits at the least cost to credit 
availability  and  economic  growth.  To  achieve 
this  balance,  we  have  assembled 
interdisciplinary  teams  for  our  significant  rulemakings,  bringing  together  economists, 
supervisors, legal staff, and other specialists to help develop sensible policy alternatives and 
to help avoid unintended consequences.  
Second,  in  addition  to  a  thorough  internal  analytic  process,  we  also  are  committed  to 
soliciting and considering the comments of others. We are, of course, consulting extensively 
with  other  financial  regulatory  agencies,  both  bilaterally  and  through  the  Financial  Stability 
Oversight  Council.  The  interagency  consultation  process  has  included  staff  discussions 
during the initial policy development stage, sharing of draft studies and regulatory text in the 
interim  phases,  and  dialogue  among  agency  principals  in  the  advanced  stages  of  several 
rulemakings.  
Along  with  the  other  agencies  testifying  today,  we  have  gone  well  beyond  the  formal 
consultation requirements of Dodd-Frank. Members of the Board, as well as staff at senior 
levels,  have  regular  meetings  with  their  counterparts  at  other  agencies  to  discuss 
implementation  issues  of  common  interest.  Consultations  at  multiple  levels  and  across 
agencies  help  to  improve  the  consistency  of  regulation  across  the  banking  industry  and 
reduce the potential for overlapping regulatory requirements. In addition, these consultations 
help highlight the interaction among different rules under development by these agencies, as 
well as the interplay between proposed policy alternatives and existing regulations.  
We are also trying to make our rulemaking process as fair and transparent as possible, with 
ample opportunity for the public to comment. During the proposal stage, we specifically seek 
comment from the public on the costs and benefits of our proposed approach, as well as on 
alternative  approaches  to  our  proposal.  We  believe  strongly  that  public  participation  in  the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 1
 rulemaking  process  improves  our  ability  to  identify  and  resolve  issues  raised  by  our 
regulatory proposals. We generally provide the public a minimum of 60 days to comment on 
all significant rulemaking proposals, with longer periods permitted for especially complex or 
significant proposals.  
Federal Reserve staff have participated in more than 300 meetings with outside parties and 
their representatives, including community and consumer groups. To promote transparency 
in  the  rulemaking  process,  we  include  in  the  public  record  a  memorandum  describing  the 
attendees and subjects covered in any meetings involving non-governmental participants at 
which Dodd-Frank rulemakings are discussed. These summaries are posted on the Federal 
Reserve Board s website on a weekly basis, as are updates on Board rulemakings and other 
Dodd-Frank initiatives.  
Third,  in  drafting  regulations,  we  have  made  special  efforts  to  identify  and,  to  the  degree 
possible consistent with statutory requirements, minimize the regulatory burden on smaller 
entities. We conduct an assessment that takes appropriate account of the potential impact a 
rule  may  have  on  small  businesses,  small  governmental 
jurisdictions,  and  small 
organizations affected by the rule, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. We have 
paid  particular  attention 
the  regulatory  burden  on  community  banking 
organizations.  For  example,  the  Federal  Reserve  has  established  community  depository 
institution advisory councils at each of the 12 Federal Reserve banks. These councils gather 
input  from  community  depository  organizations  on  ways  to  reduce  regulatory  burden  and 
improve  the  efficiency  of  our  supervision,  and  also  collect  information  about  the  economy 
from  the  perspective  of  community  organizations  throughout  the  nation.  A  representative 
from  each  of  these  12  advisory  councils  serves  on  a  national  Community  Depository 
Institution  Advisory  Council  that  meets  semiannually  with  the  Board  of  Governors  to  bring 
together the ideas of all the advisory groups.  
The  Board  of  Governors  has  also  established  a  subcommittee  of  our  regulatory  and 
supervisory oversight committee for the express purpose of reviewing all regulatory matters 
from the perspective of community depository organizations. These reviews are intended to 
find  ways  to  reduce  the  burden  on  community  depository  organizations  arising  from  our 
regulatory policies without reducing the effectiveness of those policies in improving the safety 
and soundness of depository organizations of all sizes.  
Fourth,  we  are  working  to  complete  our  Dodd-Frank  projects  as  quickly  as  possible  while 
meeting  the  three  objectives  already  stated.  There  is  obviously  considerable  value  in 
providing as much clarity as possible as soon as possible to financial markets and the public 
about the post-crisis financial regulatory landscape.  
to  reducing 
Capital regulation after Dodd-Frank 
The breadth of Dodd-Frank s provisions reflects in part that the pre-crisis regulatory regime 
had been insufficiently attentive to a variety of risks from a variety of sources. But we should 
not  forget  that  strong  capital  requirements  remain  the  most  supple  form  of  prudential 
regulation, because they can provide a buffer against bank losses from any source. To put it 
simply,  the  best  way  to  avoid  another  TARP  is  for  our  large  regulated  institutions  to  have 
adequate capital buffers, reflecting the damage that would be done to the financial system 
were such institutions to fail.  
Implicitly, passage of Dodd-Frank was a criticism of the specific features of capital regulation 
that  prevailed  during  the  pre-crisis  period.  Basel  I  capital  requirements  relied  almost 
exclusively  on  capital  ratios  that  were  snapshots  of  balance  sheets  and  thus  frequently  a 
lagging  indicator  of  a  bank  s  condition.  The  kind  of  capital  that  qualified  for  regulatory 
purposes  was  not  uniformly  reliable  as  a  buffer  against  losses.  Moreover,  capital 
requirements were set solely with reference to the balance sheet of each firm individually, 
with little attention to the economy-wide impact of financial stress at large institutions. And, 
2 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches
most  fundamentally,  capital  requirements  had  simply  been  too  low,  in  general  and  with 
respect to the risk-weightings of certain assets.  
Strong capital requirements must be at the center of the post-crisis period regulatory regime. 
The Federal Reserve is integrating the specific capital-related provisions of Dodd-Frank into 
its  overall  capital  program.  That  program  has  three  basic  components:  improving  capital 
regulation  at  the  level  of  individual  firms;  introducing  a  macroprudential  or  system-wide 
element to capital regulation; and conducting regular stress testing and capital planning. I will 
discuss each of the three areas briefly.  
The first component is to improve the traditional, firm-based approach to capital regulation. 
This work is mostly related to standards developed in cooperation with other supervisors in 
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, but there is also a Dodd-Frank element. The 
“Collins  amendment”  in  Dodd-Frank  provided  a  safeguard  against  declines  in  minimum 
capital  requirements  in  a  capital  regime  based  on  bank  internal  modeling.  The  so-called 
Basel 2.5 agreement strengthened the market risk capital requirements of Basel II. Basel III 
upgraded  the  quality  of  regulatory  capital,  increased  the  quantity  of  minimum  capital 
requirements, created a capital conservation buffer, and introduced an international leverage 
ratio  requirement.  In  the  coming  months  the  banking  agencies  will  be  jointly  proposing 
regulations consistent with Basel 2.5 and Basel III.  
The second component of our capital program is to introduce a macroprudential element to 
capital  regulation.  Section  165  of  the  Dodd-Frank  Act  mandated  that  the  Board  establish 
enhanced  risk-based  capital  standards  for  large  bank  holding  companies.  This  mandate 
complements the Basel Committee s effort to develop a framework for assessing a capital 
surcharge on the largest, most interconnected banking organizations based on their global 
systemic  importance.  Both  the  Dodd-Frank  provision  and  the  Basel  systemic  surcharge 
framework  are motivated by the fact that the failure of a systemically important  firm would 
have dramatically greater negative consequences on the financial system and the economy 
than  the  failure  of  other  firms.  In  addition,  stricter  capital  requirements  on  systemically 
important  firms  should  help  offset  any  funding  advantage  these  firms  derive  from  their 
perceived  status  as  too-big-to-fail  and  provide  an  incentive  for  such  firms  to  reduce  their 
systemic footprint.  
Of  course,  Dodd-Frank  requires  the  Federal  Reserve  to  impose  more  stringent  capital 
requirements on all bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more, not just the 
U.S.  firms  that  will  appear  on  the  Basel  Committee  s  list  of  global  systemic  banks.  No 
decision  has  yet  been  made  as  to  whether  the  more  stringent  capital  requirement  to  be 
applied to large U.S. banking firms that are not on the eventual list of global systemic banks 
will be in the form of a quantitative surcharge. However, analysis of the systemic footprints of 
these  other U.S.  bank  holding  companies  suggests  that  even  if  surcharges  were  to  apply, 
their amounts would be quite modest, at least based on the current characteristics of these 
bank holding companies.  
The third component of the Federal Reserve s capital program is to establish regular, firm-
specific stress testing and capital planning. Dodd-Frank creates two kinds of stress-testing 
requirements. First, it mandates that the Federal Reserve Board conduct annual stress tests 
on all bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in assets to determine whether they 
have  the  capital  needed  to  absorb  losses  in  baseline,  adverse,  and  severely  adverse 
economic conditions. Second, it requires both these companies and certain other regulated 
financial  firms  with  between  $10  billion  and  $50  billion  in  assets  to  conduct  internal  stress 
tests.  
We  will  be  implementing  the  specific  stress-testing  requirements  of  Dodd-Frank  beginning 
later in 2012. However, in the interim we are using a modified form of stress testing as part of 
the annual capital planning process we have established for large bank holding companies. 
Last month we announced the parameters and process for this year s capital review, which 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

 will  be  completed  in  March,  at  which  time  the  results  of  the  stress  test  will  be  publicly 
reported for the 19 largest firms.  
Conclusion 
For  all the work  that  has  already gone  into implementing  Dodd-Frank,  both at the  Federal 
Reserve  and  at  the  other  regulatory  agencies,  there  is  still  considerable  work  to  do.  Final 
regulations  implementing  some  of  the  Act  s  most  important  provisions,  such  as  the  “living 
will” requirement and the Collins amendment, are now in place. Measures to implement other 
prominent provisions, such as the Volcker rule, have been proposed, but are not yet in final 
form.  Still  others,  such  as  the  section  165  requirements,  have  not  yet  been  proposed. 
Whether completing work on proposed regulations, or moving forward with those yet to be 
proposed, the Federal Reserve will continue to pursue the four goals I noted earlier.  
Thank  you  very  much  for  your  attention.  I  would  be  pleased  to  answer  any  questions  you 
might have for me.
