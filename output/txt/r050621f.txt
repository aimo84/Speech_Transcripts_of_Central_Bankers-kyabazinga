Philipp M Hildebrand: Developing countries and international capital markets 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Philipp  M  Hildebrand,  Member  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Swiss 
National Bank, to economiesuisse, Zurich, 14 June 2005. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 After  having  plummeted  on  the  back  of  the  Asian  crisis,  capital  flows  to  developing  countries  have 
risen considerably again in the last three years. In 2005, they are likely to reach the approximate level 
at  which  they  stood  shortly  before  the  Asian  crisis.  Capital  flows  are  channelled  mostly  to  a  few 
emerging markets, notably China. China’s monetary order is currently undergoing profound changes, 
with the country gradually liberalising capital movements. The concept of the “impossible trinity”, which 
was developed by the Nobel Prize winner Robert Mundell, asserts that this will inevitably lead either to 
a loss in monetary autonomy or to a flexibilisation of the exchange rate regime. Both trends can be 
clearly observed: the pressure on the fixed exchange rate on the one hand, and the rapid expansion of 
the  monetary  and  credit  aggregates  on  the  other.  In  the  longer  term,  China’s  monetary  order  will 
probably move towards floating exchange rates. This transition will hopefully be successful. As China’s 
monetary policy of gradual change has so far proved its worth, it is likely to serve as an example to 
other developing countries.
