ROMANIA: TEN YEARS AFTER THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS 
Liviu Voinea, Deputy Governor, National Bank of Romania 
Macroeconomics Panel - 2018 FP Investor Days 
   Your Excellencies, 
Dear Guests, 
 Ten years ago, in mid-September 2008, the Lehman Brothers’ collapse became the trigger 
of the global financial crisis.  
 The main cause of the global financial crisis was, in my opinion, excessive deregulation, 
which fuelled speculative bubbles on many markets, primarily on the derivatives markets 
comprising mortgages. That crisis has thrown US and EU in the midst of financial turmoil, 
leading  to  recession,  deflation,  and  forcing  central  banks  to  take  unorthodox  measures, 
including quantitative  easing, which  led  to  negative  real  and  even  nominal  interest rates. 
Since then, US and EU have recovered, but the exit from these unorthodox policies proves 
to be harder in the EU, particularly because some countries are not better off in terms of 
public debt than they were before the crisis.  
 Emerging  markets  were  hit  even  harder,  and  their  resources  for  recovery  were  limited. 
Everyone felt the wave of the global crisis, but in the case of some emerging markets that 
was exacerbated by their domestic vulnerabilities. Today, this is more evident than before, 
when  we  witness  some  emerging  markets  being  hit  not  by  a  global  crisis,  but  by  their      
in-built vulnerabilities.  
 This is why I would like to speak today about the Romanian economy, ten years after the 
global  financial  crisis.  Are  we  better  off?  Are  we  more  protected  against  contagion 
risks?  Have  we  put  in  place  stronger  prevention  mechanisms?  Have  the  IMF/EU 
 1 
financing  agreements  paid  off?  And  what  remains  to  be  done  in  order  to  have  our 
house in order?  
 Romania  itself  faced  a  severe  economic  downturn  which  started  in  the  fourth  quarter  of 
2008 and continued until 2011 - first and foremost because of its domestic vulnerabilities. 
In  the  year  before  the  crisis,  the  current  account  deficit  exceeded  13%,  the  structural 
deficit  was  close  to  9%,  the  economic  growth  was  based  on  consumption  of  imported 
goods, and  it  was  driven  by  loose  fiscal  policy  and  by  the  credit  boom  based  on  foreign 
exchange  denominated  loans,  while  the  real  estate  bubble  reached  unprecedented  levels. 
All  that  it  was  needed  for  a  crisis  was  a  sparkle.  That  sparkle  was  the  global  financial 
crisis,  which  led  to  massive  speculative  capital  outflows,  although  the  Vienna  Initiative 
was a useful tool for damage control in this region. The rest is known and I do not want to 
insist  upon  it  here.  The  diagnosis  that  I  put  in  2009,  in  my  book  “The  end  of  illusion 
economics. Crisis and anti-crisis” is still valid.  
 Since then, Romania witnessed a decade of major transformations. Under three successive 
IMF/EU programs, we have made a long way to reform the economy and to make it more 
resilient  to  further  external  shocks.  In  what  follows,  I  will  argue  that  Romania  is  now 
more  developed  and  better  equipped  to  deal  with  external  shocks  than  it  was  ten 
years  ago;  but  risks  coming  from  unwarranted  domestic  policies  remain.  My 
assessment  is  based  on  a  longer  time  perspective  and  it  may  differ  from  a  year  on  year 
approach. 
 Romania is one of the few success stories of converging within the European Union, even 
during and after the crisis. GDP per capita at PPS increased from 50.6% of EU average in 
2008 to 62.5% in 2017. The real GDP was higher by 17.5% in 2017 as against 2008; and 
the real potential GDP was 23% higher in 2017 as against 2008 (Figure 1). By the end of 
2018, these figures will further grow by  approximately 4 percentage points, according to 
IMF and EC forecasts.  
  2 
IMF/EU  programs  from  2009  to  2015  were  successful  in  many  ways,  contributing  to  a 
sharp adjustment in the budget deficit, exit from the Excessive Deficit Procedure in 2013 
and reaching the MTO in the period 2013-2015. Structural reforms also advanced during 
the  programs,  one  indicator  of  these  being  the  large  reduction  in  public  government  and 
state enterprises’ arrears. 
 Exports of goods and services doubled in the last ten years, from 38.3 billion euro in 2008 
to 77.9 billion euro in 2017, while imports increased by only 42.7% over the same period. 
CPI-based  Real  effective  exchange  rate  (REER)  is  also  lower  than  in  2008  (Figure  2). 
Consequently,  the  negative  contribution  of  net  exports  to  GDP  has  diminished,  and  the 
current account deficit witnessed a major adjustment of about 10% of GDP.  
 The net real wage was higher by 42.7% in 2017 as compared to 2008, while the number of 
employees is also higher by 2.4% in 2017 compared to 2008.  As social contributions and 
other  taxes  were  reduced,  the  increase  in  real  wages  was  only  partially  mirrored  by  the 
increase  in  compensation  of  employees.  When  compared  against  EU  average,  labor 
productivity raised faster than compensation of employees over the entire period, therefore 
the unit labor cost, relative to our main trade partners (EU), decreased by 7.7 percentage 
points (Figure 3). This explains the positive dynamics of exports.  
 Public debt, as a percentage of GDP, is three times higher now than it was in 2008 (35% in 
2017 compared to 12% in 2008), but this is a misleading figure for a number of reasons. 
First, in 2008 and few years before that, Romania did not access international markets, by 
its  own  choice,  as  it  financed  the  deficit  from  one-off  revenues.  Second,  international 
reserves  were  10  billion  euro  higher  by  the  end  of  2017  compared  to  the  end  of  2007 
(Figure 4).  International reserves include a foreign exchange buffer which has been built 
since  2011,  reached  an  average  of  4  months  of  financing  in  2013  and  fluctuated  around 
this  level  since  then.  This  buffer  is  the  first  line  of  defense  against  short-term  external 
shocks  which  may  affect  emerging  markets,  and  our  opinion  is  that  it  is  a  very  good 
instrument which needs to be preserved and consolidated. 
  3 
Third,  the  financing  gap  is  now  much  lower  than  it  was  when  the  crisis  emerged:  after 
jumping in 2009  to  16.4%  of  GDP, it gradually  decreased  year  after  year,  it  went  below 
the 10% benchmark in 2014, then to 7.5% in 2017 and  it stagnated now in 2018. (Figure 
5). 
 Fourth, the refinancing risk has been significantly diminished as it is negatively correlated 
with the average maturity. As of June 2018, the average maturity of Romania’s Eurobonds 
is  9.7  years  (Figure  6),  and  the  investors  base  is  much  more  diversified  than  in  2011. 
Average maturity for local bonds doubled from 1.6 to 3.2 years, and the  average maturity 
of our debt is 6.4 years, compared to 3.8 years in 2011. Moreover, the share of public debt 
with  fixed  interest  rate  is  90%,  which  reduces  the  interest  rate  risk  on  the  stock  of  debt. 
Regaining  and  consolidating  our  access  to  the  international  markets  after  the  crisis  has 
been a major success of all governments and it is a sign of trust in our economy.  
 Another  factor  pointing  towards  lower  contagion  risk  from  external  shocks  refers  to  net 
external  debt.  The  net  external  debt  is  now  lower  than  in  2008:  20.2%  of  GDP  in  2017, 
against 27% in 2008 (Figure 7). 
 The  reduced  contagion  risk  is  also  visible  in  the  banking  sector,  through  at  least  5  key 
indicators.  Foreign  denominated  loans  represent  now  only  one  third  of  the  total  stock  of 
loans, compared to two thirds prior to the crisis, therefore reducing the exposure of debtors 
to  foreign  exchange  risk  (Figure  8).  Financing  from  the  parent  banks  are  now  9  billion 
euro  (as  of  July  2018),  compared  to  26.1  billion  euro  in  December  2008  (Figure  9). 
Currently (as of July 2018), domestic deposits count for 70.9% of total banks’ liabilities, 
whilst the foreign liabilities represent only 9% of total banks’ liabilities.  Loan to deposit 
ratio  decreased  from  122%  in  December  2008  to  75.2%  in  June  2018,  showing  that  the 
local  deposits  are  now  the  main  source  of  financing  for  banks.  Of  course,  the  higher 
solvability  ratio  (Figure  10)  and  the  much  lower  NPLs  (Figure  11)  also  indicate  that  the 
banking sector is more resilient now than ever to external shocks.  
  4 
Even the high  concentration of sovereign  debt in  the hands of  local  banks has  a positive 
side  effect,  which  is  the  relatively  low  reliance  on  non-residents  (they  account  for  about 
18% of the market). 
 These are all indicators of reducing the contagion effect by alleviating the risk of a sudden 
reversal in the investors’ sentiment  – which was described as  a high systemic risk in the 
latest Financial Stability Report of the National Bank of Romania.  
 Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, referring to the assessment of risks in 
emerging economies (2017), said that three elements are important: 
  first, the vulnerabilities in the EMEs themselves;  
  second, the evolution of advanced-economies monetary policies;  
  third, how markets might respond to that evolution.  
 Emerging  economies  are  takers  in  the global  markets;  we  cannot do  much  about  the  last 
two elements mentioned above, which are exogenous.  
 Our duty is to prevent the accumulation of domestic vulnerabilities, because deterioration 
in a country’s economic conditions makes it more vulnerable to adverse external shocks. 
 The  main  medium-term  vulnerabilities  of  the  Romanian  economy  refer  to  the 
accumulation of the twin deficits when growth is above potential, to debt sustainability in 
an adverse scenario, but also to the insufficient progress on structural reforms  – all being 
further  constrained  by  the  biggest  loss  of  the  last  10  years  which  is  the  loss  of  working 
force through emigration.  
 Public debt is now sustainable, but a word of caution is needed with respect to an adverse 
scenario in which the structural deficit does not return to the MTO. As our model shows 
(Figure  12  and  13),  medium  term  debt  sustainability  is  ensured  only  by  returning  to  the 
medium term budgetary objective.  
  5 
The structural budget deficit has been deviating from the  MTO (1% of GDP) since 2016. 
Nowadays structural deficit is, however, the cash deficit of tomorrow, which will need to 
be  financed  under  circumstances  that  may  turn  unfavorable  for  emerging  economies 
(Figure  14).  The  recent  economic  deceleration  from  6.9%  in  2017  to  4.2%  y-o-y  in  first 
half 2018 is a double edged sword. On the one hand, it represents a slowdown compared to 
last year. On the other hand, it brings growth towards its potential, therefore reducing the 
output  gap  and  making  growth  more  sustainable.  But,  as  former  US  President  Harry 
Truman  said,  “All  my  economists  say  on  the  one  hand…on  the  other  hand…Give  me  a 
one-handed economist!”. 
 The current account deficit, although much lower than prior to the crisis and below its long 
time  trend  of  4%  of  GDP,  remains  a  concern  because  our  peers  are  recording  current 
account  surpluses  in  these  years  (Figure  15).  However,  it  remains  fully  financed  from 
autonomous flows (FDI and European funds) (Figure 16). Let me make two remarks here. 
The FDI flows, although lower than prior to the crisis, are much more stable, as they only 
comprise  of  equity  and  reinvested  profits  (especially  after  mid-2014),  while  short-term 
intra-company loans have practically vanished. As for the European funds, in the last 10 
years, more than 40 billion euros entered the country, representing a factor of the increase 
in the monetary aggregates. 
 This brings me to the issue of inflation. Price stability is our main task and I think we did a 
good job, given the circumstances. Last year the inflation target was met.  This year, after 
a fast raise in inflation mostly due to administered prices and imported inflation, we saw 
that  inflation  stagnated  in  June  and  then  went  down  in  July,  following  our  three  interest 
rate  hikes  in  the  first  four  months  of  the  year  and  subsequently  more  firm  liquidity 
management. CORE 2 adjusted inflation, an indicator that excludes highly volatile prices, 
has been decreasing since May (Figure 17). We are confident that inflation will reach our 
target  by  the  end  of  this  year,  even  if  that  would  be  at  its  upper  bound.  Next  year,  we 
expect  inflation  to  go  down  close  to  3%,  but,  as  always,  our  predictions  are  not  interest 
rate policy-neutral.  
  6 
What  is  important  to  emphasize  is  that  investors  are  discriminating  among  emerging 
economies, and for good reasons. Romania belongs to the group of Central Europe, with 
lower  exchange  rate  volatility  than  its  peers  and  slightly  higher  yields  and  interest  rates 
than them, but very far away from the troubled emerging markets (Figure 18, 19, 20 and 
21).  
 Nevertheless, there is no time for complacency. And there is no room left for demand-side 
measures in the absence of supply side policies aimed at increasing potential GDP, and at 
improving the utilization of factors.  
 Structural  reforms  are  incomplete  and  a  possible  roadmap  for  euro-accession  or  just  for 
further  convergence  cannot  be  done  without  a  detailed  program  of  these  reforms  which 
should  cover  governance  issues  (both  in  the  public  and  private  sectors),  investment 
prioritization, better tax collection, broader reporting, centralized procurement, addressing 
the issue of companies with negative capital,  and much more.  
 In the financial sector, the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program undertaken by the 
IMF and WB has issued a number of recommendations for structural reforms, including a 
series  of  macroprudential  policies  which  the  National  Bank  has  already  started  to 
implement.  
 Agustin  Carstens,  General  Manager  of  the  Bank  for  International  Settlement,  said  at  the 
presentation  of  the  2018  Annual  Report  in  Basel:  “We  must  seize  the  day.  Addressing 
vulnerabilities  is  key  to  keeping  the  growth  momentum  on  track.  The  stronger 
performance gives us a window to pursue necessary reforms and recalibrate policies. Let’s 
not miss this opportunity”.  
 On this note, let me conclude here and wish you all not to miss the opportunities.

Note: 1) Public debt interest payments as a ratio to average public debt in 2014. 
2) The primary government budget balance of 0.3 percent of GDP corresponded to a structural deficit of around 1 percent 
of GDP (MTO – Medium-Term Budgetary Objective) in 2014.
3) 2.8 percent is the real growth rate in 2014. 
Source: MPF, NBR calculations
Maintaining the deficit within the limits set by the MTO (medium term objective) ensures long-term
sustainability of public debt
