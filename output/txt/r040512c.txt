Philipp M Hildebrand: Open world - Switzerland open to the world 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Dr  Philipp  M  Hildebrand,  Member  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Swiss 
National Bank, at the Swiss Economic Forum, Thun, 7 May 2004. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 Globalisation  - the  worldwide  exchange  of  production  factors,  goods,  technologies  and  ideas -  is  a 
process  that  has  evolved  in  different  ways  and  degrees  ever  since  humankind  can  remember. 
Technological  progress  is  the  actual  driving  force  behind  globalisation.  It  thus  becomes  possible  to 
reduce  costs  through  increasing  specialisation  and  the  best  use  of  comparative  advantages.  The 
process  of  globalisation,  however,  is  restricted  to  some  extent  by  national  and  international  legal 
frameworks. Despite overall positive and widespread net effects, globalisation is, however, frequently 
not accepted due to adjustment costs arising for certain global players. 
With  its  successful  export  sector  and  its  comparatively  attractive  local  conditions,  particularly  the 
excellent infrastructure and the flexible labour market, Switzerland has the potential to benefit from the 
continuing  globalisation  in  future  as  well.  A  necessary  condition  for  this,  however,  is  a  rise  in 
productivity  and,  as  a  result,  enhanced  competitiveness  of  the  domestic  sector.  With  international 
competitive pressure intensifying, insulating itself or merely adhering to the status quo are no options 
for Switzerland in the long term. This would lead to considerable losses in social security and growth 
and threaten the long-term survival of the country’s social institutions.
