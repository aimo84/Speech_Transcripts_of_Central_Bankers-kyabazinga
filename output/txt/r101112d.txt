Caleb M Fundanga: Third quarter 2010 media briefing 
Presented  by  Dr  Caleb  M  Fundanga,  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Zambia,  Lusaka, 
8 November 2010. 
 Executive summary  
This brief examines monetary policy implementation and its outcomes in the third quarter of 
2010.  The  brief  also  reviews  other  economic  and  financial  sector  developments.  In  the 
conclusion, it provides an inflation outlook for the fourth quarter of 2010.  
Monetary policy  
The  focus  of  monetary  policy  during  the  third  quarter  of  2010  continued  to  be  the 
achievement  of  the  end-year  annual  inflation  target  of  8.0%.  Consistent  with  this  inflation 
outturn, annual overall inflation was programmed at 7.3% for end-September 2010.  
To  achieve  this,  the  Bank  of  Zambia  utilised  largely  Open  Market  Operations  and 
Government securities auctioning to maintain reserve money within the programmed growth 
path. This was to be complemented by prudent fiscal management.  
Inflation  
Quarterly overall inflation increased to 1.6% in September 2010 from the 1.0% recorded in 
June 2010, but was slightly lower than the 1.7% recorded in the third quarter of 2009. This 
outturn was mainly attributed to the rise in food inflation to –0.1% from the –1.7% recorded in 
the previous quarter, as non-food inflation slowed down to 3.2% from 3.7% during the same 
period.  
However, the annual overall inflation rate was largely unchanged at 7.7% in September 2010 
compared  to  the  7.8%  recorded  in  June  2010,  but  was  above  the  projected  7.3%  for  the 
period. This outturn was largely attributed to the decline in annual food inflation to 2.8% from 
3.8% recorded in June 2010 as non-food inflation increased to 12.5% from 11.8% during the 
same period.  
The  decline  in  food  inflation  was  on  account  of  price  reductions  on  cereals,  various 
vegetables,  various  beef  products,  mutton  and  dried  kapenta,  due  to  improved  seasonal 
supply factors.  
Annual  non-food  inflation  increased  on  account  of  pass-through  effects  of  the  Kwacha 
exchange rate depreciation, coupled with higher transport fares and the upward adjustment 
of electricity tariffs by an average of 25.6% during the period under review.  
Money supply and domestic credit  
Preliminary estimates indicate that growth in broad money (M3), comprehensively defined to 
include foreign currency deposits, was 7.2% in the third quarter of 2010 down from 13.3% as 
at  end-June  2010,  and  was  above  the  4.0%  projected  quarterly  growth  rate.  In  absolute 
terms, M3 is estimated to have increased to K17,898.9 billion from K16,698.3 billion in June 
2010. The outturn in M3 was largely due to the increase in both Net Domestic Assets (NDA) 
and Net Foreign Assets (NFA).  
On  an  annual  basis,  M3  growth  increased  to  32.0%  in  September  2010  from  27.7%  in 
June 2010. This outturn was due to the rise in NDA by 96.9% (June 2010, rose by 58.2%) 
primarily  on  account  of  increased  lending  to  government.  However,  the  NFA  fell  by  9.8% 
compared with a fall of 1.2% recorded in June 2010.

Total domestic credit, comprehensively defined to include foreign currency loans, increased 
by  3.1%  at  end-September  2010  compared  with  10.1%  growth  registered  in  the  second 
quarter of 2010. This was mainly due to a 4.4% rise in net claims on central government. 
Similarly, lending to the private sector (including public enterprises) grew by 2.2%.  
On  an  annual  basis,  domestic  credit  growth  at  13.5% 
in  September  2010  was 
10.1 percentage points lower than the 23.6% recorded in June 2010. This largely reflected a 
slowdown in credit to the private sector, including public enterprises to 0.7% compared with 
the 25.9% growth recorded in June 2010. However, lending to the government increased by 
41.7% from 108.9% in June 2010.  
On  a  sectoral  basis,  households  (personal  loans  category)  continued  to  account  for  the 
largest share of outstanding credit, accounting for 26.3% (26.2%)1 in September 2010. The 
agricultural sector was second at 17.1% (18.5%), followed by manufacturing 13.4% (13.0%), 
wholesale  and  retail  trade,  12.0%  (11.7%),  transport,  storage  and  communications,  5.3% 
(5.4%) and real estate, 5.4% (5.2%).  
Interest rates  
Demand for Government securities remained strong although it was relatively lower during 
the quarter under review. Therefore, yield rates trended higher across all tenors.  
In  the  Treasury  bills  market,  the  composite  weighted  average  yield  rate  increased  by 
2.5 percentage  points  to  an  average  of  7.4%  from  4.9%  recorded  in  the  second  quarter. 
Similarly,  the  composite  weighted  average  yield  rate  for  Government  bonds  increased  by 
109 basis points to 11.5% during the third quarter, up from an average of 10.4% recorded in 
the previous quarter.  
Developments  in  commercial  banks’  nominal  interest  rates  were  mixed  during  the  quarter 
under  review.  The  weighted  average  lending  base  rate  (WALBR)  continued  its  downward 
trend, falling to 19.8% from 20.9% in June 2010. Similarly, the average lending rate (ALR) fell 
marginally  to  26.8%  in  September  2010  from  27.9%  in  June  2010.  However,  the  30-day 
deposit  rate  for  amounts  exceeding  K20  million  and  the  average  savings  rate  (ASR)  for 
amounts above K100,000 remained unchanged at 5.6% and 4.7%, respectively.  
Real sector  
Developments  in  the  real  sector  were  favourable  during  the  reviewed  quarter.  This  was 
reflected  in  increased  output  of  metals  (copper  &  cobalt),  beer,  soft  drinks  and  cement. 
Further, international arrivals also increased during the period under review.  
The  stock  of  maize  grain  held  by  major  millers  in  the  country  rose  by  124.6%  to 
101,807.0 metric tonnes (mt) as at 29th September 2010 from 45,336.7 mt as at 30th June 
2010. In terms of holdings by province, Lusaka contributed 51,117.1 mt (50.2%), Copperbelt 
26,644.0 mt (26.2%), Southern 19,861.0 mt (19.5%), Western province 4,050.0 mt (4.0%), 
and Northern 35.0 mt (0.03%) respectively, while Eastern province accounted for 100.0 mt 
(0.1%).  
During  the  reviewed  quarter,  copper  output  increased  by  16.4%  to  232,554.87  mt  from 
199,621.06  mt  in  the  previous  quarter.  This  outturn  reflected  continued  improvement  in 
hydro-geological  conditions  and  uninterrupted  mining  operations  in  the  country  resulting  in 
increased ore extraction at both open pit and deep underground mines. On a year- to-date 
basis,  copper  output  at  625,844.1  mt  was  20.9%  higher  than  the  quantity  produced  in  the 
corresponding period of 2009.

Cobalt output also increased by 16.1% to 2,349.41 mt during the third quarter of 2010 from 
2,023.84  mt  recorded  in  the  previous  quarter.  The  improvement  in  output  mainly  reflects 
continued benefits arising from the resumption of production at Konkola Copper Mines and 
Chambishi  Metals  Plc  coupled  with  improved  hydro-geological  conditions.  Further,  cobalt 
output on a year-to-date basis at 6,362.2 mt was 59.7% higher than the 3,982.9 mt of cobalt 
produced  in  the  corresponding  period  of  2009.  Cement  output2  increased  by  26.1%  to 
234,240.7  mt  in  the  third  quarter  of  2010  from  185,702.0  mt  during  the  previous  quarter. 
However, on a year-to-date basis, output of cement at 577,130 mt was 4.0% lower than the 
601,432.5 mt produced in the same period of 2009.  
During  the  quarter  under  review,  international  arrivals  at  the  country’s  four  international 
airports3  were  124,244  passengers  compared  with  105,163  passengers  in  the  second 
quarter of 2010. This was 20.7% higher than 102,918 passengers recorded during the same 
quarter in 2009.  
Foreign exchange market  
The slow pace of economic recovery in the United States continued to cast a dark shadow on 
the US dollar, the world’s most traded currency. The lingering economic uncertainty and the 
burgeoning fiscal deficit drove the US dollar weaker across all currencies.  
Therefore, benefitting from the broad based dollar weakness and relatively high levels of US 
dollar liquidity in the market, the Kwacha posted a 5.0% gain against the American currency. 
A  sustained  rise  in  the  copper  prices  at  the  London  Metal  Exchange  to  an  average  of 
US$7,281.08 per tonne in the third quarter from US$6,530.00/per tonne gave further support 
to  the  domestic  currency,  with  the  interbank  rate  ending  the  period  at  an  average  of 
K4,869.21 per US dollar.  
increased 
to  US  $453.6  million 
Balance of payments  
Preliminary data show that Zambia’s overall balance of payments (BoP) recorded a surplus 
of US $357.6 million during the third quarter of 2010 compared to a deficit of US $94.3 million 
in the previous quarter. This was driven by the improvement in the performance of both the 
current account and the capital and financial account balances.  
The  current  account  surplus 
from  a  surplus  of 
US $92.8 million  recorded  the  previous  quarter,  reflecting  an  increase  in  the  merchandise 
trade  surplus  coupled  with  the  narrowing  of  the  services  and  income  accounts  deficits. 
Supporting the current account was the merchandise trade surplus which rose by 74.8% to 
US $897.2 million in the quarter under review following an increase in exports as well as a 
decline in imports.  
Merchandise export earnings edged upward by 18.7% to US $1,949.6 million, on account of 
increases in both metal and non-traditional export earnings. Metal export earnings recorded 
a 20.0% rise to US $1,611.5 million during the reviewed period, following a rise in copper 
export earnings although earnings from cobalt fell.  
Cobalt export earnings declined by 0.5% to US $75.7 million in the third quarter of 2010 due 
to  a  13.8%  drop 
from 
US $37,858.20 per mt in the second quarter. Nevertheless, cobalt export volumes increased 
by 15.4% to 2,318.14 mt in the third quarter of 2010.  
the  average  realised  price 
to  US  $32,642.20  per  mt 
in

During  the  reviewed  period,  non-traditional  exports  (NTEs)  increased  by  13.2%  to 
US $338.1 million.  This  was  principally  due  to  an  increase  in  export  earnings  from  cane 
sugar,  cotton  lint,  electrical  cables,  fresh  flowers,  fruits  and  vegetables,  and  electricity 
products.  
Merchandise imports declined by 6.1% to US $1,078.9 million during the reviewed quarter. A 
slide in import bills associated with commodity groups, such as, petroleum products, fertiliser, 
paper and paper products, and industrial boilers and equipment, explained this outturn.  
Developments in the financial sector  
The overall financial condition of the banking sector for the quarter ended September 2010 
was  satisfactory.  On  aggregate,  the  banking  sector  was  adequately  capitalised  and  the 
liquidity levels remained high. The sector’s profit after tax also improved, although the asset 
quality modestly deteriorated.  
The overall financial condition and performance of the Non Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI) 
sector was rated fair during the quarter under review. The sector was adequately capitalised 
with  “fair”  asset  quality  while  earnings  and  liquidity  performance  were  also  rated  “fair”. 
However, the leasing subsector reported regulatory capital deficiencies.  
During the quarter under review, the FinScope 2009 Consumer Survey report was launched 
to the public in Lusaka and Ndola. The survey findings indicated that agricultural activities 
still remained a major source of income for most Zambians yet the sector was largely under-
served. Overall, there was a marginal increase of 3.6 percentage points in financial access to 
37.3% in 2009 from 33.7% in 2005.  
Developments in banking, currency and payment systems  
During  the  quarter,  there  was  a  continued  improvement  in  the  availability  of  electronic 
payment  options.  The  number  of  Point  of  Sale  (POS)  terminals  increased  by  3.8%  to 
1,033 terminals (Quarter 2 2010: 995). The volume of POS transactions also increased by 
15% to 199,817 (Quarter 2 2010: 173,606) while the values increased by 13% to K86 billion 
(Quarter 2 2010: K76 billion).  
The number of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) increased by 4% to 468 ATMs (Quarter 2 
2010: 450). The volume of ATM transactions also increased by 11% to 6,333,073 (Quarter 2 
2010:  5,697,122).  The  Bank  would  like  to  continue  urging  the  public  to  use  electronic 
payment  methods  as  they  provide  a  more  convenient,  safer,  efficient  and  effective  way  of 
making payments.  
The  volume  and  value  of  cheques  returned  unpaid  on  account  of  insufficiently  funded 
accounts  continued  to  decrease  following  the  issuance  of  the  directives  on  dishonoured 
cheques and direct debit instructions by the Bank of Zambia in the second quarter of 2010. 
The volume of unpaid cheques decreased by 15% to 4,202 (Quarter 2: 4,929). The public is 
advised  to  ensure  that  they  have  sufficient  funds  on  their  accounts  whenever  they  issue 
cheques in order to avoid charges.  
Economic reform programme  
An IMF Mission was in Zambia from 2nd to 15th September, and 28th October to 3rd November 
2010,  to  conduct  the  5th  Review  under  the  Extended  Credit  Facility  (ECF)  arrangement. 
Overall, the mission was satisfied with the programme performance and reached agreement 
with the Zambian authorities on a set of macroeconomic policies and structural measures for 
the remainder of 2010 and for 2011. The policies and structural measures would pave the 
way for the completion of the Fifth Review of the ECF arrangement, subject to approval by 
the IMF’s Executive Board.

 BIS Review 148/2010
Total  disbursed  poverty  reduction  budget  support  (PRBS)  in  the  third  quarter  of  2010 
amounted to US $19.5 million from the World Bank. A total of US $150.0 million mining tax 
revenue  was  received  while  the  Bank  of  Zambia  foreign  exchange  purchases  from  the 
market amounted to US $70.0 million.  
Preliminary data indicate that the quantitative performance criteria under the Extended Credit 
Facility (ECF) arrangement were observed as at end-September 2010 and that all structural 
benchmarks were generally on track.  
National budget 2011  
The  Minister  of  Finance  and  National  Planning  announced  the  2011  National  Budget  on 
October  8,  2010.  The  Government  maintained  its  focus  on  diversifying  the  economy, 
increasing productive employment and maintaining a stable macro-economic environment.  
The key Macroeconomic objectives for 2011 are;  
 
 
 
The  growth  in  GDP  for  2011  is  premised  on  the  continued  strong  performance  of  the 
agriculture, mining, construction, manufacturing, transport and communications and tourism 
sectors.  
To exceed 6% GDP growth;  
To reduce end-year inflation to 7.0%; and  
To maintain international reserves of at least 4 months of import cover.  
Inflation outlook for the third quarter of 2010  
In the fourth quarter of 2010, annual overall inflation is projected to remain below the end 
year  target  of  8.0%.  This  favourable  outlook  is  on  account  of  expected  stability  in  maize 
prices in view of the bumper harvest in 2010, favourable supply of vegetables and fresh fish 
during  the  period  and  relative  stability  of  the  exchange  rate  of  the  Kwacha  against  the 
US dollar for much of the fourth quarter.  
However,  the  Bank  of  Zambia  will  continue  to  monitor  developments  and  undertake 
appropriate monetary policy actions to ensure that monetary targets are achieved. To contain 
growth of money supply within the programmed path, Bank of Zambia will continue to employ 
open  market  operations  and  auctioning  of  Government  securities.  This  is  expected  to  be 
complemented by prudent fiscal operations.  
I thank you for your attention. 
Introduction 
This brief examines monetary policy implementation and its outcomes in the third quarter of 
2010.  The  brief  also  reviews  other  economic  and  financial  sector  developments.  In  the 
conclusion, it provides an inflation outlook for the fourth quarter of 2010.  
Monetary policy  
The  focus  of  monetary  policy  during  the  third  quarter  of  2010  continued  to  be  the 
achievement  of  the  end-year  annual  inflation  target  of  8.0%.  Consistent  with  this  inflation 
outturn, annual overall inflation was programmed at 7.3% for end-September 2010.  
To  achieve  this,  the  Bank  of  Zambia  utilised  largely  Open  Market  Operations  to  maintain 
reserve  money  within  the  programmed  growth  path.  This  was  to  be  supported  by  the 
BIS Review 148/2010

auctioning  of  Government  securities  and  the  maintenance  of  the  fiscal  deficit  within  the 
programme limits.  
Inflation  
Quarterly overall inflation increased to 1.6% in September 2010 from the 1.0% recorded in 
June 2010, but was slightly lower than the 1.7% recorded in the third quarter of 2009. This 
outturn was mainly attributed to the rise in food inflation to –0.1% from the –1.7% recorded in 
the previous quarter, as non-food inflation slowed down to 3.2% from 3.7% during the same 
period.  
However, on an annual basis, overall inflation was little changed at 7.7% in September 2010 
when compared to the 7.8% recorded in June 2010, but was above the projected 7.3% for 
the period. This annual inflation outturn was largely attributed to the decline in annual food 
inflation  to  2.8%  from  3.8%  recorded  in  June  2010,  as  annual  non-food  inflation  rose  to 
12.5% from 11.8% during the same period.  
Food inflation  
Quarterly  food  inflation  rose  to  –0.1%  in  September  2010  from  the  –1.7%  recorded  in  the 
previous  quarter,  but  was  1.0  percentage  point  below  the  0.9%  recorded  during  the  third 
quarter  of  2009.  This  was  due  to  higher  prices of  rice,  various  beef  products,  pork  chops, 
mutton, fresh kapenta, dried kapenta, carrots, green beans, groundnuts and cassava tubers 
during the quarter under review. This was attributed to the impact of the upward adjustment 
of transport charges in July 2010 on the commodity market.  
Annual  food  inflation  fell  on  account  of  price  reductions  on  cereals,  various  vegetables, 
groundnuts, tubers, beef products (fillet steak, rump steak), mutton and dried kapenta, due to 
improved seasonal supply factors.  
Non-food inflation  
Quarterly non-food inflation slowed down to 3.2% from the 3.7% observed in June 2010, but 
was 0.7 percentage points above the 2.5% recorded in the third quarter of 2009. This was 
mainly  attributed  to  lower  quarterly  inflation  for  the  following  sub-groups:  Furniture  and 
household goods of 4.5% [7.5%], Medical care 1.6% [2.7%], Transport and communications 
0.9%  [5.1%],  Recreation  and  Education  –0.1%  [1.3%],  and  other  goods  and  services 
1.7% [2.8%].  
However,  on  an  annual  basis,  non-food  inflation  increased  to  12.5%  from  the  11.8% 
registered in June 2010. This was due to higher annual inflation rates for the following sub-
groups:  Clothing  and  footwear  by  11.3%,  [9.9%]4;  Furniture  and  household  goods  11.5%, 
[10.1%];  Transport  and  communications  15.3%,  [11.1%];  and  other  goods  and  services 
14.1%,  [12.8%].  These  developments  reflected  pass-through  effects  of  the  Kwacha 
exchange rate depreciation by 4.8% over the 12 month period, coupled with higher transport 
fares  and  the  upward  adjustment  of  electricity  tariffs  by  an  average  of  25.6%  during  the 
period  under  review.  Non-food  inflation  contributed  6.3  percentage  points  to  the  annual 
overall inflation outturn.

 BIS Review 148/2010
Broad money and domestic credit5 
Preliminary estimates indicate that growth in broad money (M3), comprehensively defined to 
include foreign currency deposits, was 7.2% in the third quarter of 2010 down from 13.3% as 
at  end-June  2010,  and  was  above  the  4.0%  projected  quarterly  growth  rate.  In  absolute 
terms,  M3  is  estimated  to  have  increased  to  K17,898.9  billion  from  K16,698.3  billion  in 
June 2010. The outturn in M3 was largely due to the increase in both NDA and NFA. NFA 
edged up by 12.2% mainly on account of a 15.7% increase in gross international reserves to 
US $1,972.0 million as at end-September 2010. The increase in NDA was mainly due to the 
expansion in lending to the Government. Excluding foreign currency deposits that increased 
by  30.2%  (June  2010,  fell  by  5.1%),  money  supply  declined  by  2.0%  compared  to  the 
22.9% growth recorded during the second quarter of 2010.  
On  an  annual  basis,  M3  growth  increased  to  32.0%  in  September  2010  from  27.7%  in 
June 2010. This outturn was due to the rise in NDA by 96.9% (June 2010, rose by 58.2%) 
primarily  on  account  of  increased  lending  to  government.  However,  the  NFA  fell  by  9.8% 
compared with a fall of 1.2% recorded in June 2010. Excluding foreign currency deposits that 
grew by 29.8% (June 2010, fell by 5.9%), money supply growth was 33.2% from the 49.0% 
recorded in June 2010.  
Total domestic credit, comprehensively defined to include foreign currency loans, increased 
by  3.1%  at  end-September  2010  compared  with  10.1%  growth  registered  in  the  second 
quarter of 2010. This was mainly due to a 4.4% rise in net claims on central government that 
contributed 1.7 percentage points to the growth in domestic credit. Similarly, lending to the 
private  sector  (including  public  enterprises)  grew  by  2.2%  and  contributed  1.4  percentage 
points  to  the  total  domestic  credit  outturn.  Excluding  foreign  currency  denominated  credit, 
which fell by 4.1%, domestic credit increased by 5.2% compared to the 7.5% registered in 
June 2010.  
On  an  annual  basis,  domestic  credit  growth  at  13.5% 
in  September  2010  was 
10.1 percentage  points  lower  than  23.6%  recorded  in  June  2010.  This  largely  reflected  a 
slowdown in credit to the private sector, including public enterprises, to 0.7% compared with 
the 25.9% growth recorded in June 2010. This outturn contributed 0.4 percentage points to 
the  total  domestic  credit  growth  in  the  quarter  under  review.  However,  lending  to  the 
government increased by 41.7% from 108.9% in June 2010 and contributed 13.1 percentage 
points to the total domestic credit growth.  
On  a  sectoral  basis,  households  (personal  loans  category)  continued  to  account  for  the 
largest share of outstanding credit, accounting for 26.3% (26.2%)6 in September 2010. The 
agricultural sector was second at 17.1% (18.5%), followed by manufacturing 13.4% (13.0%), 
wholesale  and  retail  trade,  12.0%  (11.7%),  transport,  storage  and  communications,  5.3% 
(5.4%) and real estate, 5.4% (5.2%).  
Interest rates  
Demand for Government securities remained strong although it was relatively lower during 
the quarter under review. The average rate of subscription at the Treasury bill tenders was 
recorded at 123.7% down from 129.5% in the preceding period. Similarly, the average rate of 
subscription  rate  for  Government  bonds  was  down  at  123.5%  compared  with  126.6% 
recorded in the second quarter. Although participation at the auctions was strong, yield rates 
trended higher across all tenors, as investors sought to sustain recent gains on government 
paper.

In  the  Treasury  bills  market,  the  composite  weighted  average  yield  rate  increased  by 
2.5 percentage  points  to  an  average  of  7.4%  from  4.9%  recorded  in  the  second  quarter. 
Similarly,  the  composite  weighted  average  yield  rate  for  Government  bonds  increased  by 
109 basis points to 11.5% during the third quarter, up from an average of 10.4% recorded in 
the previous quarter.  
During  the  quarter  ending  September  2010,  developments  in  commercial  banks’  nominal 
interest rates were mixed. The weighted average lending base rate (WALBR) continued its 
downward trend, falling to 19.8% from 20.9% in June 2010. Similarly, the average lending 
rate (ALR) fell marginally to 26.8% in September 2010 from 27.9% in June 2010. However, 
the  30-day  deposit  rate  for  amounts  exceeding  K20  million  and  the  average  savings  rate 
(ASR) for amounts above K100,000 remained unchanged at 5.6% and 4.7%, respectively.  
Real sector developments  
Developments  were  favourable  in  the  real  sector  during  the  reviewed  quarter.  This  was 
reflected  in  increased  output  of  metals  (copper  &  cobalt),  beer,  soft  drinks  and  cement. 
Further, international arrivals also increased during the period under review.  
Agriculture  
The stock of maize grain held by major millers in the country rose by 124.6% to 101,807.0 mt 
as at 29th September 2010 from 45,336.7 mt as at 30th June 2010. In terms of holdings by 
province,  Lusaka  contributed  51,117.1  mt  (50.2%),  Copperbelt  26,644.0  mt  (26.2%), 
Southern  19861.0  mt  (19.5%),  Western  4,050.0  mt  (4.0%),  and  Northern  35.0  mt  (0.03%) 
respectively, while Eastern province accounted for 100.0 mt (0.1%). Data on maize stocks 
from Central province was not available at the reporting date.  
Mining  
During  the  reviewed  quarter,  copper  output  increased  by  16.4%  to  232,554.87  mt.  This 
output was also 30.5% higher than the 178,140.1 mt of copper produced in the third quarter 
of  2009.  This  outturn  reflected  continued  improvement  in  hydro-geological  conditions  and 
uninterrupted mining operations in the country at both open pit and deep underground mines. 
On a year to date basis, copper output at 625,844.1 mt was 20.9% higher than the quantity 
produced in the corresponding period of 2009.  
Cobalt output also increased by 16.1% to 2,349.41 mt during the third quarter of 2010 from 
2,023.84  mt  recorded  in  the  previous  quarter.  This  level  of  output  reflected  a  16.6%  rise 
compared  to  2,015  mt  produced  in  the  third  quarter  of  2009.  The  improvement  in  output 
mainly  reflects  continued  benefits  arising  from  the  resumption  of  production  at  Konkola 
Copper Mines and Chambishi Metals Plc coupled with improved hydro-geological conditions. 
Further,  cobalt  output  on  a  year-to-date  basis  at  6,362.2  mt  was  59.7%  higher  than  the 
3,982.9 mt of cobalt produced in the corresponding period of 2009.  
Manufacturing  
Cement output7 by the monitored company increased by 26.1% to 234,240.7 mt in the third 
quarter of 2010 from 185,702.0 mt during the previous quarter. Nonetheless, on a year-to- 
date basis, output of cement at 577,130 mt was 4.0% lower than the 601,432.5 mt produced 
in the same period of 2009.

 BIS Review 148/2010
During  the  quarter  under  review,  production  of  clear  beer  by  the  monitored  company 
increased  by  26.7%  to  223,607  hectolitres  from  176,515  hectolitres  the  previous  quarter 
Further,  this  output  was  45.9%  higher  than  the  153,220  hectolitres  produced  in  the 
corresponding quarter of 2009.  
Output of soft drinks by the monitored company rose by 1.8% to 127,244.0 hectolitres from 
124,944.0  hectolitres  produced  in  the  previous  quarter.  Moreover,  this  output  level  was 
38.3% higher than 91,968.0 hectolitres produced in the corresponding quarter of 2009.  
Production of milk by the monitored company during the quarter under review rose by 4.2% 
to  7,830,878  litres  from  7,510,227  litres  produced  in  the  second  quarter  of  this  year. 
However,  this  output  was  1.2%  lower  than  7,924,054.0  litres  of  milk  produced  during  the 
corresponding quarter of 2009.  
Tourism  
During  the  quarter  under  review,  international  arrivals  at  the  country’s  four  international 
airports8  were  124,244  passengers  compared  with  105,163  passengers  in  the  second 
quarter of 2010. This was 20.7% higher than 102,918 passengers recorded during the same 
quarter  in  2009.  Livingstone  and  Mfuwe  international  airports,  which  are  the  major  tourist 
destinations,  accounted  for  21,272  passengers  and  241  passengers  compared  with 
18,180 passengers and 269 passengers in the previous quarter, respectively.  
During  the  third  quarter  of  2010,  tourist  entries  into  the  country’s  national  parks9  were 
25,244 compared  with  13,737  in  the  previous  quarter.  Nevertheless,  this  was  lower  than 
26,720  in  the  corresponding  quarter  of  2009.  Europe  accounted  for  9,404  followed  by 
Zambia  (residents)  at  7,308  while  North  America,  Rest  of  America  and  Australasia  were 
4,016, 2,810 and 1,412 respectively. The rise in the entries into the country’s national parks 
was in part attributed to the world cup and improved weather conditions.  
External sector developments  
Foreign exchange market  
The slow pace of economic recovery in the United States continued to cast a dark shadow on 
the US dollar, the world’s most traded currency. The lingering economic uncertainty and the 
burgeoning fiscal deficit drove the US dollar weaker across all currencies.  
Therefore,  benefitting  from  the  broad  based  dollar  weakness  and  relatively  high  levels  of 
US dollar  liquidity  in  the  market,  the  Kwacha  posted  a  5.0%  gain  against  the  American 
currency. A sustained rise in the copper prices at the London Metal Exchange to an average 
of  US$7,281.08  per  tonne  in  the  third  quarter  from  US$6,530.00/per  tonne  gave  further 
support to the domestic currency, with the interbank rate ending the period at an average of 
K4,869.21 per US dollar.  
The weakness in the US dollar saw the Euro and the pound sterling rebound, underpinned 
by  austerity  measures  instituted  in  Greece  and  the  United  Kingdom  and  favourable  bank 
stress test results in the European Union banking sector. Reflecting this recovery, the South 
African  rand,  which  tracks  the  euro,  also  performed  well,  posting  significant  gains  in  the 
currency  market.  These  developments  saw  the  Kwacha  depreciate  against  the  three 
currencies during the review period. It shed off 1.3% value against the euro and depreciated 
by  1.9%  vis-à-vis  the  rand  ending  the  quarter  at  an  average  of  K6,344.50/€  and

K677.45/ZAR, respectively. The rate of depreciation against the pound sterling was relatively 
lower at 0.6% with the Kwacha trading at K7,560.15/£.  
With  regard  to  the  volume  of  foreign  exchange  transactions,  a  total  of  US$1,230.7  million 
was exchanged in the domestic interbank market. From the rest of the market, commercial 
banks  purchased  a  net  of  US$49.2  million  compared  to  net  sales  of  US$4.7  million  the 
previous quarter. Similarly banks made net purchases of €1.4 million Euros during the review 
period.  
Conversely, banks’ net sales of the South African rand amounted to ZAR729.3 million, higher 
than  ZAR645.3  million  recorded  in  the  second  quarter.  Transactions  involving  the  pound 
sterling followed a similar trend, with commercial banks recording net sales of ₤2.5 million 
depicting a reduction over the previous quarter’s net sales of ₤1.7 million.  
increased 
to  US  $453.6  million 
Balance of payments  
Preliminary data show that Zambia’s overall balance of payments (BoP) recorded a surplus 
of US $357.6 million during the third quarter of 2010 compared to a deficit of US $94.3 million 
in the previous quarter. This was driven by the improvement in the performance of both the 
current account and the capital and financial account balances.  
The  current  account  surplus 
from  a  surplus  of 
US $92.8 million  recorded  the  previous  quarter,  reflecting  an  increase  in  the  merchandise 
trade  surplus  coupled  with  the  narrowing  of  the  services  and  income  accounts  deficits. 
Supporting the current account was the merchandise trade surplus which rose by 74.8% to 
US $897.2 million in the quarter under review following an increase in exports as well as a 
decline in imports.  
Merchandise export earnings edged upward by 18.7% to US $1,949.6 million, on account of 
increases in both metal and non-traditional export earnings. Metal export earnings recorded 
a  20.0%  rise  to  US $1,611.5  million  during  the  reviewed  period,  following  a  rise  in  copper 
export earnings although earnings from cobalt fell.  
Cobalt export earnings declined by 0.5% to US $75.7 million in the third quarter of 2010 due 
to  a  13.8%  drop 
from 
US $37,858.20 per  mt  ton  in  the  second  quarter.  This  was  despite  the  increase  in  cobalt 
export volumes by 15.4% to 2,318.14 mt in the third quarter of 2010.  
During  the  reviewed  period,  non-traditional  exports  (NTEs)  increased  by  13.2%  to 
US $338.1 million.  This  was  principally  due  to  an  increase  in  export  earnings  from  cane 
sugar,  cotton  lint,  electrical  cables,  fresh  flowers,  fruits  and  vegetables,  and  electricity 
products.  
Merchandise imports declined by 6.1% to US $1,078.9 million during the reviewed quarter. A 
slide in import bills associated with commodity groups, such as, petroleum products, fertiliser, 
paper and paper products, and industrial boilers and equipment, explained this outturn.  
During the same quarter, the services and income account deficits narrowed by 5.7% and 
1.5% to US $168.0 million and US $369.3 million, respectively.  
The capital and financial account surplus increased to US $278.5 million in the third quarter 
2010  from  US $122.3 million  the  previous  quarter.  This  was  largely  due  to  an  increase  in 
project grants coupled with a reduction in portfolio and other investment outflows.

Developments in the financial sector  
The overall financial condition of the banking sector for the quarter ended September 2010 
was  satisfactory.  On  aggregate,  the  banking  sector  was  adequately  capitalised  and  the 
10 
 BIS Review 148/2010
the  quarter  under  review 
liquidity levels remained high. The sector’s profit after tax also improved, although the asset 
quality modestly deteriorated.  
The overall financial condition and performance of the Non Bank Financial Institutions sector 
was rated fair during the quarter under review. The sector was adequately capitalised with 
“fair” asset quality while earnings performance was rated “satisfactory”. However, the leasing 
subsector reported regulatory capital deficiencies and unsatisfactory earnings performance.  
During 
the  Financial  Sector  Development  Plan  (FSDP) 
Implementation and FSDP Steering Committees approved the work plans and budgets of the 
six FSDP Working Groups for the period 2010 to 2012.  
During the quarter under review, the FinScope 2009 Consumer Survey report was launched 
to the public in Lusaka and Ndola. The survey findings indicated that agricultural activities 
still remained a major source of income for most Zambians but that this sector was largely 
under-served by financial service providers. The survey findings also showed that there was 
an increase in the number and types of banking services and products but that the uptake 
had remained unchanged as the focus of financial service providers appeared to be serving 
the same market, as opposed to enhancing financial inclusion. Overall, there was a marginal 
increase of 3.6 percentage points in financial access to 37.3% in 2009 from 33.7% in 2005. 
Developments in banking, currency and payment systems  
During  the  quarter,  there  was  a  continued  improvement  in  the  availability  of  electronic 
payment  options.  The  number  of  Point  of  Sale  (POS)  terminals  increased  by  3.8%  to 
1,033 terminals (Quarter 2, 2010: 995). The volume of POS transactions also increased by 
15% to 199,817 (Quarter 2, 2010: 173,606) while the values increased by 13% to K86 billion 
(Quarter 2, 2010: K76 billion).  
The number of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) increased by 4% to 468 ATMs (Quarter 2 
2010: 450). The volume of ATM transactions also increased by 11% to 6,333,073 (Quarter 2 
2010:  5,697,122)  while  the  value  increased  by  16%  to  K2,898  billion  (Quarter  2  2010: 
K2,498 billion). The Bank would like to continue urging the public to use electronic payment 
methods  as  they  provide  a  more  convenient,  safer,  efficient  and  effective  way  of  making 
payments.  
The  volume  and  value  of  cheques  returned  unpaid  on  account  of  insufficiently  funded 
accounts  continued  to  decrease  following  the  issuance  of  the  directives  on  dishonoured 
cheques and direct debit instructions which were issued by the Bank of Zambia in the second 
quarter  of  2010.  The  volume  of  unpaid  cheques  decreased  by  15%  to  4,202  (Quarter  2: 
4,929).  Similarly  the  value  of  unpaid  cheques  decreased  by  6.6%  to  K35.3  billion  from 
K37.8 billion reported in the second quarter of 2010. The public is advised to ensure that they 
have  sufficient  funds  in  their  accounts  whenever  they  issue  cheques  in  order  to  avoid 
charges.  
Economic reform programme  
An IMF Mission was in Zambia from 2nd to 15th September 2010, to conduct the 5th Review 
under  the  Extended  Credit  Facility  (ECF)  arrangement.  Overall,  the  mission  was  satisfied 
with the programme performance. A follow-up mission visited the country from 28th October 
to 3rd November 2010 to conclude the discussions.  
The mission had fruitful discussions with the Zambian authorities and reached agreement on 
a set of macroeconomic policies and structural measures for the remainder of 2010 and for 
2011.  The  policies  and  structural  measures  would  pave  the  way  for  the  completion  of  the 
Fifth Review of the ECF arrangement, subject to approval by the IMF’s Executive Board. The 
Board meeting is expected to be held around mid-December 2010.  
BIS Review 148/2010 
 11
The IMF mission commended the Zambian Government for its handling of economic policy 
so  far  in  2010.  Notably,  fiscal  performance  has  been  broadly  in  line  with  expectations 
although  there  was  been  need  to  finance  the  purchase  of  the  maize  surplus.  The  mission 
also noted that the Bank of Zambia managed monetary policy well with a view to reducing 
inflation  whilst  at  the  same  time  maintaining  conditions  to  facilitate  economic  growth. 
Economic prospects remain favourable, with growth projected to remain strong in 2010. In 
addition,  the  2011  budget  is  consistent  with  the  maintenance  of  sound  macroeconomic 
policies.  Furthermore,  envisaged  revenue  enhancement  which  stems  from  new  tax  policy 
measures and administrative improvements, is appropriately ambitious whilst the expenditure 
mix shifts towards capital and social spending.  
Total  disbursed  poverty  reduction  budget  support  (PRBS)  in  the  third  quarter  of  2010 
amounted to US $19.5 million from the World Bank. A total of US $150.0 million mining tax 
revenue  was  received  from  First  Quantum  Mining  Plc  while  the  Bank  of  Zambia  foreign 
exchange purchases from the market amounted to US $70.0 million. Against these inflows 
were  payments  to  PTA  Bank  (US  $116.0  million)  for  oil  procurement  and  debt  service 
payments (US $15.9 million).  
Preliminary information showed that the Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of the Bank of Zambia, 
the  Net  Domestic  Financing  (NDF)  of  Government  and  the  Unencumbered  International 
Reserves  (UIR)  quantitative  performance  criteria  under  the  Extended  Credit  Facility  (ECF) 
arrangement were observed as at end-September 2010. Further, all structural benchmarks 
were generally on track.  
National budget 2011  
The  Minister  of  Finance  and  National  Planning  announced  the  2011  National  Budget  on 
October 8, 2010.  
In the budget, the Government maintained its focus on diversifying the economy, increasing 
productive employment and maintaining a stable macro-economic environment.  
The key Macroeconomic objectives for 2011 are;  
 
 
 
The  growth  in  GDP  for  2011  is  premised  on  the  continued  strong  performance  of  the 
agriculture, mining, construction, manufacturing, transport and communications and tourism 
sectors.  
To exceed 6% GDP growth;  
To reduce end-year inflation to 7.0%; and  
To maintain international reserves of at least 4 months of import cover.  
Inflation outlook for the fourth quarter of 2010  
In the fourth quarter of 2010, annual overall inflation is projected to remain below the end 
year  target  of  8.0%.  This  favourable  outlook  is  on  account  of  expected  stability  in  maize 
prices in view of the bumper harvest in 2010; expected favourable supply of vegetables and 
fresh  fish  during  the  period  and  expected  relative  stability  of  the  exchange  rate  of  the 
Kwacha against the US dollar for much of the fourth quarter.  
At  end-September  2010,  annual  inflation  was  largely  unchanged  at  7.7%  compared  to  the 
7.8% recorded in June 2010, due to a decline in annual food inflation against a rise in annual 
non-food inflation during the same period. Consistent with this outturn, inflation projections 
indicate an annual overall inflation rate of 7.3% for end-December 2010.  
The  Bank  of  Zambia  will  continue  to  monitor  developments  and  undertake  appropriate 
monetary policy actions to ensure that monetary targets are achieved. To contain growth of 
12 
 BIS Review 148/2010
money  supply  within  the  programmed  path,  Bank  of  Zambia  will  continue  to  employ  open 
market  operations  and  auctioning  of  Government  securities.  This  is  expected  to  be 
complemented by prudent fiscal operations.
