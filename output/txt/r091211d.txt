Ignazio Visco: Global imbalances in the financial crisis and the 
international monetary system 
Distinguished lecture by Mr Ignazio Visco, Deputy Director General of the Bank of Italy, at 
the XVIII International “Tor Vergata” Conference on “Money, Banking, and Finance”, Rome, 
4 December 2009. 
In the preparation of this speech I have benefited of extensive discussions with Pietro Catte and Patrizio Pagano. 
I am solely responsible, however, of the views here presented. 
 The financial crisis and its macroeconomic roots 
Even though the crisis caught a large part of the economics profession by surprise, this was 
not because economists and policy makers had entirely failed to notice the growing elements 
of vulnerability in the foundations of the global economic expansion. Before the crisis, many 
of them had identified the risk of a hard landing for the US economy, but in most cases they 
saw  it  as  originating  in  the  unsustainable  US  current  account  imbalance,  which  might 
eventually lead to a disorderly dollar depreciation. As it turned out, the trigger of the global 
financial crisis and its proximate causes were essentially financial in nature, and originated in 
a specific segment of US financial markets.  
However, I don’t think that the fundamental sources of vulnerability for the world economy 
had been wrongly identified. Even though the proximate causes of the crisis lie in previous 
financial excesses, I would suggest these would not have developed to the same extent had 
the  macroeconomic  environment  not  been  characterised  by  large  saving-investment 
imbalances,  very  low  interest  rates  and  asset  price  misalignments.  These  factors  created 
enormous stress for a US and global financial system in  which innovations and regulatory 
failures had progressively introduced serious structural flaws. It may also be argued that the 
complacency  on  the  part  of  risk  managers  and  financial  supervisors  that  allowed  financial 
vulnerabilities to grow unchecked owed much to the climate of general optimism that those 
macro  conditions  supported.  And  when  we  look  at  how  a  local  financial  crisis  propagated 
rapidly across markets, not just in industrialized countries but globally, and then triggered a 
global  recession,  it  is  also  clear  that  only  a  much  broader  set  of  interrelated  factors  – 
macroeconomic as well as financial – could have generated a crisis of these proportions. 
Over the 10–15 years that preceded the crisis, it was already possible to identify a number of 
signals  of  macroeconomic  stress,  which  interacted  with  financial  system  flaws  to  build  up 
very significant, although at the time partly hidden, financial fragilities1:  
– 
the dramatic fall in US households’ saving rate, from around 7 percent in the early 
1990s to close to zero in 2005–2007; 
a  very  large  increase  in  US  and  global  liquidity,  also  reflecting  the  generally 
accommodating US monetary conditions; 
the widening of global imbalances, recognised as unsustainable already in the late 
1990s; 
                                                   
1   A  more  extensive  discussion  of  these  macroeconomic  developments  can  be  found  in  a  previous 
paper presented this spring to a G20 Workshop (see I. Visco, “The global crisis: the role of policies 
and the international monetary system”, in G20 Workshop on the Global Economy, Macroeconomic 
causes  of  the  crisis:  Key  lessons,  Mumbai,  India,  24–26  May  2009,  pp.  60–80,  available  at

  an  enormous  increase  in  official  reserves,  largely  concentrated  in  emerging  Asia 
and  the  oil  exporting  countries,  which  mostly  pegged  their  currencies  to  the  US 
dollar; 
very low levels of global long-term interest rates and asset price volatility after 2003; 
a sequence of asset price bubbles, in the United States and globally, most notably 
the dot.com equity bubble of the late 1990s, followed by an unusually synchronised 
global housing price boom. 
Essentially,  these  disequilibria  reflected  rapid  and  sustained  growth  in  final  demand, 
especially  consumption  demand,  in  the  United  States,  financed  by  over-borrowing,  and 
ultimately  by  borrowing  from  abroad.  This  happened  against  a  background  of  abundant 
saving in the rest of the world, especially in Asia; excess savings at the global level tended to 
compress  real  interest  rates  to  abnormally  low  levels  when  compared  to  average  GDP 
growth.  
If the United States served as a sort of “consumer of last resort,” other large advanced and 
emerging economies implicitly or explicitly followed an export-led growth strategy, which is 
difficult to maintain indefinitely but also difficult to abandon.  
The role of policies 
2. 
Policies  had  a  non-negligible  role  in  sustaining  this  pattern  of  unbalanced  growth.  To 
illustrate their role in building up the conditions that eventually led to the global recession, a 
recapitulation  of  the  sequence  of  events  that  have  marked  the  last  ten  to  fifteen  years, 
condensed in the following six statements, might be useful:  
1) 
Around the mid-1990s, the acceleration of US productivity associated with the ICT 
revolution  and  the  increase  in  household  net  worth  due  to  rising  equity  prices 
determined  a  first  upward  shift  in  private  sector  propensities  to  invest  and  to 
consume.  
The  US  monetary  policy  stance  generally  accommodated  the  hype  in  the  “new 
economy”  in  the  late  1990s;  by  historical  standards  it  was  particularly  easy  for  a 
prolonged period after the bursting of the dot-com bubble.  
By  sustaining  US  domestic  demand,  the  hype  in  the  “new  economy”  and  the 
expansionary monetary (and fiscal) stance contributed to an unsustainable widening 
of the US external imbalance, compensated by growing imbalances of opposite sign 
in  the  external  positions  of  major  emerging  economies,  especially  after  the  Asian 
crisis of 1997–98. 
A number of Asian and oil exporting countries that pegged their currencies to the US 
dollar accumulated very substantial official reserves. The investment of these in US 
Treasury paper contributed to lower long-term interest rates.  
Low interest rates triggered a search for yield which, by squeezing risk premiums, 
tended  to  make  financial  conditions  even  more  favourable  for  a  broad  range  of 
borrowers. Low perceived risk, abundant liquidity and credit expansion, as well as 
regulatory failures in some markets, helped feed the house price bubble. 
Eventually,  global  supply  reached  bottlenecks  in  the  form  of  commodity  supply 
constraints, US monetary policy was gradually tightened, and house prices peaked. 
At that point, the large risk exposures that had accumulated in the financial system 
suddenly became apparent, precipitating the turmoil.  
2) 
3) 
4) 
5) 
6) 
As it is clear from this brief and very simplified overview, two central elements of the story 
are:  (a)  an  overly  expansionary  US  monetary  policy,  which  permitted  a  long  expansion  of 
consumer  spending  financed  by  growing  indebtedness;  (b)  the  choice  by  China  and  other 
2 
 BIS Review 161/2009
emerging countries to follow an export-led growth strategy supported by pegging currency to 
the US dollar, resulting in the accumulation of large official reserves.  
Both policies were attractive in the short run, but ultimately unsustainable in the long run. In 
order to understand what allowed them to be maintained for such a long time we need, first, 
to review the conceptual setup that has been used to frame and to assess monetary policy 
choices, including the role (at best a secondary one) assigned to asset price and financial 
stability  among  the  responsibilities  of  central  banks.  Secondly,  we  have  to  reassess  the 
functioning of the existing international monetary system, asking in particular why it did not 
effectively  induce  the  correction  of  the  imbalances  and  promote  policies  conducive  to  the 
orderly functioning of the world economy.  
3. 
The limits of the existing policy setup 
Monetary policy 
3.1 
It  has  been  convincingly  argued  that  as  a  result  of  the  success  achieved  by  macro-
stabilisation  policies  and  of  structural  changes  in  the  responsiveness  of  aggregate  supply 
(also as a result of globalisation), inflation expectations are now much better anchored, and 
episodes of excess creation of liquidity and credit tend to be reflected primarily in asset price 
bubbles, rather than in increased consumer price inflation.  
The  task  of  monetary  policy  in  this  context  is  not  necessarily  easier.  Because  asset  price 
cycles  tend  to  be  associated  with  large  changes  in  indebtedness  and  add  to  financial 
vulnerabilities, they can pose significant risks to financial stability, and therefore interfere with 
the achievement of macroeconomic stability.  
The relevant question is probably not whether monetary policy should target more than just 
consumer  price  inflation  –  it  probably  could  not,  with  just  a  single  policy  instrument  –  but 
rather  whether  it  should  react  to  information  on  asset  price  misalignments  and  financial 
imbalances  in  the  context  of  a  flexible  inflation-targeting  (or  equivalent)  framework.  The 
standard answer to this question – that asset prices and financial imbalances will normally be 
taken into account insofar as they impinge on the central bank’s objective of price stability – 
is not very satisfactory in practice. Such frameworks rely on forecasts, whose precision can 
only  decline  as  we  move  to  more  distant  time  horizons.  The  models  we  use  to  interpret 
economic data and to set policy are particularly lacking in the treatment of asset prices. In 
particular, we do not know enough about the effects of asset price misalignments and related 
imbalances, and also econometric estimates have trouble capturing rare “extreme events”. 
Many of the effects associated with asset price imbalances are, anyway, likely to be highly 
non-linear and complex. 
Although there is a growing consensus that central banks need to monitor risks to financial 
stability and to take them into account in the conduct of monetary policy, we still lack a theory 
of how this can be done in practice. Trying to balance such risks, whose potential size, shape 
and time horizon are extremely uncertain, against the other, more standard sources of risks 
to price stability involves a particularly difficult kind of trade-off. To improve the terms of this 
trade-off  it  is  essential  to  proceed  decisively  with  the  reforms  of  financial  regulation  and 
supervision already outlined by the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee. The 
aim of these reforms is to correct the serious incentive distortions revealed by the crisis and, 
in  this  way,  to  make  financial  systems  both  more  resilient  and  less  pro-cyclical.  Important 
gains in the direction of addressing the twin objectives of price and financial stability not only 
BIS Review 161/2009

with  the  instruments  of  monetary  policy  can  probably  be  achieved  by  developing  macro-
prudential policy tools.2 
The international monetary system 
3.2 
The US monetary expansion and China’s exchange rate pegging could be maintained for so 
long  because  they  were  mutually  reinforcing.  Demand  from  US  consumers  helped  sustain 
China’s (and other countries’) export growth. At the same time, an elastic supply of cheap 
imports  from  Asia  helped  keep  inflation  low  in  the  United  States,  encouraging  the  Fed  to 
maintain  an  easy  monetary  stance.  And  the  investment  of  emerging  economies’  official 
reserves in US Treasuries contributed to compress long-term yields both in the United States 
and globally. All this fed global liquidity and rising asset prices. 
The  countries  that  pegged  their  currencies  to  the  dollar  effectively  imported  US  monetary 
policy, regardless of whether it was appropriate for domestic conditions. This fuelled liquidity 
and credit expansion, also because of difficulties in sterilizing the effects of the accumulation 
of official reserves, and tended to feed booms in domestic asset prices and investment. 
Other  surplus  countries  also  had  a  responsibility  in  allowing  the  imbalances  to  grow.  In 
Japan, long delays in facing up to the structural problems of the financial sector caused a 
prolonged  stagnation  of  demand.  In  Germany  and  other  European  countries  the  labour 
market  reforms  introduced  in  recent  years,  in  the  absence  of  equally  forceful  reforms  in 
product markets, have largely translated into stagnating wages and weak domestic demand. 
Even  though  the  imbalances  were  not  sustainable,  there  was  no  effective  mechanism  – 
market-based or activated by multilateral surveillance – to induce a correction. On the one 
hand,  by  pegging  their  currencies  to  the  US  dollar,  surplus  countries  managed  to  avoid 
pressure to adjust. On the other hand, the role of the US dollar as the international reserve 
currency  (the  “exorbitant  privilege”)  implied  that  the  United  States  could  finance  persistent 
current  account  deficits  without  coming  under  market  pressure,  as  long  as  the  surplus 
countries were willing to accumulate dollar assets. Having US external liabilities denominated 
in dollars and international assets mostly in foreign currencies had the additional advantage 
that the US net investment position improved when the dollar depreciated. 
Although  the  international  monetary  system  based  on  the  “dollar  standard”  has  not  been 
performing some of its essential functions, it is by no means clear what could replace it. All 
those that have been mentioned – a supranational currency like the SDR; a tripolar system 
based on the dollar, the euro and an Asian currency – face very substantial difficulties.  
Underlying all this is the fact that the international monetary system that emerged after the 
demise  of  Bretton  Woods  is  a  “non-system”,  driven  by  the  revealed  exchange  rate 
preferences  of  the  individual  countries,  with  a  very  weak  multilateral  surveillance,  despite 
recent attempts to strengthen it. The regime of fixed exchange rate pegs was never replaced 
by  one  of  generalised  free  floating,  but  instead  gave  way  to  a  hybrid  system.  In  practice, 
throughout the last 35 years, the exchange rate policies of a majority of countries have been 
marked by widespread “fear of floating”, with large foreign exchange intervention. This fear is 
not  at  all  surprising,  since  large  exchange  rate  fluctuations  driven  by  capital  flows  can  be 
highly disruptive in a world that is increasingly integrated economically and financially3. 
                                                 
2   A broad and lively debate on the design of such tools has recently developed. See, for example, the paper by 
C. Borio on “Implementing the macroprudential approach to financial regulation and supervision” (published in 
Banque de France Financial Stability Review, September 2009), the discussion paper by the Bank of England 
(“The  role  of  macroprudential  policy”,  Discussion  paper,  November  2009)  and  the  report  of  the  Warwick 
Commission  on  International  Financial  Reform  (The  Report  of  the  Second  Warwick  Commission  Report:  In 
praise of unlevel playing fields, November 2009).

system”, cit.

The main challenges ahead 
Correcting global imbalances and fostering sustainable growth 
4.1 
Whatever the shape of the future system, an urgent task – to be addressed as soon as the 
economic situation improves – is correcting existing imbalances.  
The fundamental macroeconomic imbalances that lay at the root of the financial crisis are not 
being righted by the consequent global recession. At present, the rise in US private sector 
saving and the sharp fall in investment, partly offset by a larger public sector deficit, appear 
to  have  narrowed  the  US  current  account  deficit  from  5.3  per  cent  of  GDP  in  2007  to 
2.6 per cent  in  2009,  as  projected  by  the  IMF.  However,  most  of  the  reduction  is  due  to 
cyclical,  not  structural,  factors;  the  effect  of  lower  oil  prices  should  also  be  seen  as 
essentially cyclical (Figures 1 and 2).  
Moreover,  exchange  rate  movements  have  not  generally  supported  the  correction  of 
imbalances. The dollar first depreciated until July 2008, then appreciated by 20 per cent in 
effective terms until March 2009, as the turmoil engendered demand for dollar liquidity and 
large capital flows out of emerging markets sought a safe haven in US Treasury securities. 
Those  flows  were  then  reversed  as  investors’  flight  to  safety  abated  and  the  financial 
situation  normalised,  and  the  dollar  has  accordingly  started  depreciating  again,  returning 
approximately where it was in July 2007 (Figure 3).  
What happens as the world economy comes out of the recession depends largely on what 
drives the recovery: if it is an expansion of demand in the surplus countries – including not 
only emerging Asia, but also Japan and some European countries – some real correction of 
imbalances is possible; but if the world again relies on US consumers as the primary source 
of demand growth, then imbalances will widen once more.  
There is now a growing awareness of the importance of rebalancing global demand in order 
to achieve a more sustainable pattern of growth. The joint statement released in September 
of  this  year  following  the  G20  summit  in  Pittsburgh  acknowledges  that:  “ensuring  a  strong 
recovery  will  necessitate  adjustments  across  different  parts  of  the  global  economy,  while 
requiring  macroeconomic  policies  that  promote  adequate  and  balanced  global  demand  as 
well as decisive progress on structural reforms that foster private domestic demand, narrow 
the global development gap, and strengthen long-run growth potential.” However, it is still not 
evident how (and whether) each country will in fact implement such shared understanding. 
In China, a shift toward greater reliance on domestic demand – and particularly consumption 
–  will  require  increased  public  spending  on  health  and  social  safety  nets,  which  can 
encourage  a  lower  precautionary  saving,  as  well  as  reforms  in  the  governance  of  public 
enterprises. 
In Europe, potential output needs to grow faster so as to allow for higher growth in domestic 
demand without jeopardizing price stability. Japan similarly needs to boost productivity and 
domestic  demand.  In  both  regions,  this  will  clearly  be  a  substantial  challenge,  requiring  a 
renewed emphasis on structural reforms. 
If  economies  were  able  to  achieve  a  major  rebalancing  of  global  demand  from  deficit  to 
surplus  countries,  while  allowing  for  a  full  and  sustainable  recovery  of  world  economic 
growth,  exchange  rates  would  probably  have  to  move  as  well,  reflecting  such  structural 
adjustments. But unless the shifts in underlying saving and investment flows are sufficiently 
large and sustained to make a substantial contribution to the correction of imbalances, the 
expectation  may  grow  that  a  large  exchange  rate  correction  of  the  US  dollar  against  the 
currencies  of  surplus  countries  will  eventually  be  required.  This  could  trigger  disorderly 
exchange rate movements.  
Such a scenario would pose a very difficult challenge to the countries, such as China, that 
have accumulated large quantities of official reserves, predominantly in US dollars. However, 
BIS Review 161/2009

continuing to peg their currencies will only postpone the day of reckoning, while increasing 
the potential capital losses.  
This  dilemma  is  exacerbated  by  the  fact  that  a  country  that  acted  alone  in  allowing  its 
currency  to  appreciate  would  stand  to  lose  significantly  in  terms  of  trade  competitiveness. 
This  is  a  classic  case  in  which  collective  action,  if  feasible,  would  be  welfare-improving.  It 
might  take  the  form  of  a  cooperative  agreement  among  Asian  surplus  countries  for  some 
kind  of  joint  “managed  currency  appreciation”.  The  boost  to  domestic  demand  (and  the 
associated  real  appreciation)  would  have  to  be  large  enough  to  ensure  a  significant 
correction of imbalances.  
But  we  also  need  a  mechanism  to  maintain  orderly  exchange  rate  movements  while  the 
rebalancing  of  global  demand  is  carried  out.4  The  solution  is  unlikely  to  consist  in  simply 
asking the countries with dollar peg regimes to shift abruptly to full exchange rate flexibility. 
Equally unrealistic would be its polar opposite, a “world currency”, which would require a very 
high  degree  of  price  and  wage  flexibility.  I  think  that  pragmatic  solutions  based  on 
intermediate regimes, such as target zones or bands and currency baskets, should not be 
dismissed out of hand. 
4.2 
Exit strategies: supporting the recovery without creating new sources of 
financial instability 
At present, the main priority of monetary and fiscal policies in all advanced countries and in 
many emerging ones is still to support the economic recovery by offsetting the weakness in 
private  consumption  and  investment  demand  and  the  effects  of  financial  sector  de-
leveraging. However, the focus of the policy discussion has already shifted to the issue of 
when and how to unwind the exceptional monetary and fiscal stimulus. In fact, policy makers 
are well aware that such exceptional measures, if maintained too long, could become new 
sources of instability.  
One source of risks is the huge accumulation of public debt, which could potentially lead to a 
higher cost of borrowing if markets were to become concerned about its sustainability. The 
IMF has estimated that government debt in G-20 countries will reach 118 per cent of GDP in 
2014, and that lowering it to 60 per cent by 2030 would require an improvement in structural 
primary balances by 8 percentage points of GDP (Figures 4 and 5).5 Achieving shifts of these 
proportions  will  involve  tough  policy  choices.  In  particular,  facing  the  challenges  posed  in 
most countries by the projected rise in age-related expenditures can no longer be postponed. 
Only by committing now in a clear and credible way to a path of budgetary consolidation can 
governments preserve the flexibility they deem necessary in the short term.  
The  other  risk  is  that  a  protracted  period  of  very  low  policy  interest  rates  and  abundant 
liquidity may end up fuelling new asset price bubbles, thus building up the conditions for the 
next  crisis.  There  is  growing  concern  that  this  may  already  be  happening,  although  the 
evidence so far is mixed:  
– 
In advanced economies, markets for equities and other risky assets have staged a 
stunning  recovery  since  March.  As  regards  equities,  there  is  not  yet  clear-cut 
evidence  that  this  has  gone  too  far,  based  on  the  indicators  usually  watched  to

Conference on “A new approach to global economic and social growth”, London, 16 October 2009, available 
at http://www.bis.org/review/r091021e.pdf). On the reform of the international monetary system, I would also 
refer  to  the  recent  IMF  paper,  “The  debate  on  the  international  monetary  system”,  by  I. Mateos  y  Lago,  R. 
Duttagupta and R. Goyal (SPN/09/26, November 2009).

  assess asset valuations. However, this depends crucially on how strong we expect 
the economic recovery to be, and there is still considerable uncertainty on that. An 
equally  striking  shift  in  attitudes  toward  risk  seems  to  have  occurred  in  corporate 
bond markets, where risk spreads have narrowed substantially even though default 
rates are continuing to rise. 
In  the  case  of  prices  of  raw  materials  the  evidence  of  overvaluation  is,  at  the 
moment, rather scant. Yet, pressure on prices may rapidly grow – as it did in 2008 – 
once world demand returns to a more sustained pace of growth. 
In my view, the risk of an excessive creation of liquidity feeding bubbles in financial 
and real asset prices is significantly greater in emerging economies, many of which 
have been receiving large capital inflows. Controlling the effects of such inflows on 
domestic credit and asset markets is especially difficult in those countries that, by 
choosing to peg their exchange rate, import the monetary policy stance from abroad 
even though it may not be appropriate to domestic conditions (Figure 6). 
This raises two difficult questions. The first is whether the timing and speed of monetary exit 
strategies should be contingent on developments in asset markets. If the latter were to signal 
that abundant liquidity is feeding new speculative excesses while the economic recovery is 
not  yet  firmly  established,  a  trade-off  could  potentially  arise  between  macroeconomic  and 
financial stability. The second question is to what extent, if any, monetary policy in the United 
States should be conducted taking into account the fact that it is also exported to emerging 
economies with pegged exchange rates, such as China. In earlier times this question could 
have been easily dismissed, since the feedback effects of the induced monetary expansion 
abroad on the US economy and its financial system were second-order. Now, however, this 
is  no  longer  the  case,  as  witnessed  by  the  key  role  played  by  global  macroeconomic 
interactions in the genesis of the crisis, as I have outlined above.  
You will probably recognize that these are – in slightly different form – the same two issues 
that  I  put  at  the  centre  of  my  analysis  of  how  macroeconomic  policies  helped  create  the 
conditions that led to the crisis. The fact that we are still grappling with them as we come out 
of the global recession suggests that they are largely unresolved. This shows how delicate 
and important is the continuation and effective enhancement of the international economic 
policy cooperation so forcefully advocated within the G20 process.
