Lars Nyberg: The Baltic region in the shadow of the financial crisis 
Speech  by  Mr  Lars  Nyberg,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  Intervalor  and 
Baltic Property Trust, Stockholm, 9 September 2009.  
 The global financial crisis has now been with us for over two years. It began in the summer of 
2007  with  anxiety  about  all  the  complicated credit  instruments  that  had  been  issued  using 
subprime  US  mortgages  as  collateral.  However,  the  most  acute  phase  of  the  crisis  began 
almost exactly a year ago when the investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy 
protection.  This  was  followed  by  such  a  rapid  and  extensive  decline  in  liquidity  in  the 
international banking system that it led to a global financial crisis that also hit Sweden. The 
financial crisis accelerated and reinforced the economic downturn that had already begun. As 
a result, production around the world has fallen to an extent that we have not seen since the 
Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The  countries  in  the  Baltic  region,  which  are  the  subject  of  today's  discussion,  have  also 
suffered. The Baltic states, that is Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, have been hit hardest by the 
crisis. As a couple of the Swedish banks dominate the Baltic banking system, this has had 
consequences here in Sweden too. 
Today, I intend to speak about how we at the Riksbank view the economic development of, 
and financial stability in, the Baltic region. The Baltic states and Sweden are naturally closes 
to our interests, so I will focus primarily on these countries. And as all financial crises are in 
various ways linked to the banks' loans on the property markets, I also see this seminar as 
an excellent opportunity to discuss these markets too. 
We have heard and seen little more than negative news over the last 12 months and most 
forecasters,  including  the  Riksbank,  have  underestimated  the  strength  of  the  international 
economic downturn. Now, however, we are beginning to see increasingly distinct signs of a 
stabilisation of the global economy, above all on the financial markets. I therefore intend to 
conclude my speech by saying a few words about this. 
The economic integration of the Baltic region is increasing 
The Baltic region consists of eight countries. They are all members of the European Union 
(EU) and the region has a total population of almost 72 million.1 This is more than 15 per 
cent of the total population of the EU member states.2 Throughout the course of history, the 
countries in the region have had close links with each other, not least because of common 
economic interests. The Hanseatic League is a thing of the past, but the ties between the 
countries have not weakened, quite the reverse. The economic links are now stronger than 
ever and a large part of the countries' trade takes place within the region.  
However, the integration does not relate to trade alone. Over the last ten years, Nordic banks 
have increasingly established operations in other countries in the region and have begun to 
offer  their  services  to  households  and  companies  across  national  borders.  Swedbank,  for 
example, accounts for almost 45 per cent of total lending in Estonia, while SEB accounts for

I have chosen to define the Baltic region as Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Northern Germany (i.e. the federal 
states  of  Schleswig-Holstein,  Mecklenburg-Vorpommern  and  Hamburg),  Poland  and  the  Baltic  states  – 
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

30 per cent of lending in Lithuania.3 Prior to the beginning of the crisis, the operations in the 
Baltic states also generated an increasing proportion of the earnings of these two banks (see 
Figure 1 and Table 1). Other major players are Nordea and Danske bank, which can now 
regard practically the entire Baltic region as their domestic market.  
This  financial  integration  has  many  economic  advantages,  but  it  also  poses  major 
challenges.  I  do  not  intend  to  discuss  this  further  here,  but  will  simply  say  that  when  the 
financial systems of different countries become intertwined, the risk increases that problems 
will spread across national borders. As far as Sweden is concerned, this has resulted in a 
decline in confidence not just in the Baltic economies but in the Swedish economy too. This 
is because there is a risk that developments in the Baltic states will entail substantial loan 
losses  for  the  Swedish  banks.  This  is  one  of  the  reasons  why  the  Swedish  krona  has 
weakened  against  the  euro.  In  the  period  since  the  beginning  of  the  crisis  to  the  present 
date, the krona has depreciated by approximately eight per cent against the euro. However, 
the fall has been even sharper over the last 12 months, reaching 18 to 19 per cent in March 
2009.  
Rapid downturn in the Baltic states 
It became increasingly clear that the rate of growth in the world was beginning to slow down 
already in 2008. But it was not until the autumn, when the global financial crisis really took 
hold, that the situation seriously deteriorated. At present, the global economy is in recession 
and GDP is expected to fall by one per cent this year. World trade is expected to fall by over 
12 per cent.4 GDP is expected to fall in our region too – by 5 per cent in Sweden, which is 
slightly  more  than  the  figure  for  our  Nordic  neighbours.  Development  in  Germany  is 
somewhat weaker than in Sweden, while zero growth is expected in Poland. The situation is 
much worse in the Baltic states (see Figures 2 and 3), where GDP is currently expected to 
fall between 15 and 20 per cent this year.5 This means that the crisis in the Baltic states is 
unparalleled  compared  with  previous  crises.  The  labour  market  has  also  weakened 
dramatically  throughout  the  region.  This  is  evident  not  least  in  the  Baltic  states  where 
unemployment  has  now  reached  almost  17  per  cent.  Only  a  year  ago,  the  level  of 
unemployment was approximately 5 per cent (see Figure 4).  
For several years, development in the Baltic states could be described as a fantastic success 
story with high economic growth. In the period 2005 to 2007, for example, economic growth 
in  Estonia  and  Latvia  was  approximately  10  per  cent  per  year,  while  development  in 
Lithuania  was  more  moderate.  At  the  same  time,  however,  major  domestic  imbalances 
developed which laid the foundations for the crisis we are witnessing today.  
When  the  Baltic  states  moved  from  being  regulated  economies  to  market  economies, 
optimism  about  the  future  was  high  and  both  household  consumption  and  private  sector 
investment  increased  dramatically.  However,  the  investments  went  to  the  service  and 
property sectors instead of to developing production capacity in the industrial sector. Export 
development was thus weak while imports increased rapidly as a result of strong domestic 
demand. Consequently, the current account deficits of the Baltic states increased (see Figure 
4). The deficits were largely funded by taking loans in euro, mainly from Swedish and other 
foreign banks. The high level of economic growth led to the overheating of the labour market 
and wages and inflation increased (see Figure 6). In Latvia, for example, nominal wages in 
                                                 
3   Swedbank's market shares in the second quarter of thiss year amounted to 43 per cent in Estonia, 25 per cent 
in Latvia and 22 per cent in Lithuania. SEB's market shares in the same period amounted to 24 per cent in 
Estonia and 15 and 29 per cent in Latvia and Lithuania respectively.

the public sector increased by more than 35 per cent in the year prior to the outbreak of the 
crisis,  and  in  the  private  sector  by  over  30  per  cent  (see  Figure  7).  As,  however,  nominal 
interest  rates  remained  low,  the  high  level  of  inflation  entailed  negative  real  interest  rates, 
which further fuelled the expansion of credit. Even though credit began to expand from a very 
low level, the rate of development was startling and it did not take long before the debts of 
the companies in relation to GDP reached levels only slightly below the level of private sector 
indebtedness in Sweden (see Figure 8). Household indebtedness did not increase quite as 
much (see Figure 9). As all three countries had also in various ways tied their currencies to 
the euro with the aim of eventually joining the European Monetary Union, they were not able 
to use monetary policy to restrict demand. The interest rate weapon was limited to the aim of 
maintaining the fixed exchange rate. At the same time, fiscal policy was expansionary and 
accelerated development.  
Unlike  the  other  countries  in  the  Baltic  region,  the  Baltic  states  thus  entered  the  global 
financial crisis with several underlying weaknesses. There were large savings deficits in both 
the  private  and  public  sectors  and  a  high  level  of  indebtedness  in  the  private  sector.  The 
loans  also  gave  rise  to  a  growing  currency  crisis.  In  addition,  increasing  cost  pressures 
gradually undermined the competitiveness of the three countries.  
When the global financial crisis broke out, economic growth in the Baltic states had already 
begun  to  decline.  Declining  growth  and  the  large  current  account  deficits  led  investors  to 
begin  reappraising  the  value  of  eastern  European  and  central  European  assets.  Capital 
inflows dried up, which made it more difficult to fund many projects and further reinforced the 
downturn in economic activity. The credit rating agencies downgraded the Baltic states, one 
after  the  other,  which  further  aggrevated  the  shortage  of  capital.  The  lack  of  capital  thus 
helped to reinforce the downturn in the same way that the surplus of capital once reinforced 
the dramatic upturn.  
There are some signs that the real economy in this part of the Baltic region has now begun to 
stabilise, but unfortunately the recovery may be a long, slow process. This is partly because 
external  demand  is  still  weak  as  a  result  of  the  global  recession.  Above  all,  however,  it  is 
because domestic demand is low due to the fact that the Baltic states are now carrying out 
so-called  internal  devaluations.  This  means  that  wages  and  other  costs  have  been 
substantially reduced to restore competiveness and to counteract the serious weakening of 
public finances. In the case of Latvia, this is taking place within the framework of a financial 
support programme led by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the EU. The previous 
imbalances  have  now  declined  in  all  of  the  three  countries.  The  current  account  is,  for 
example, now showing a surplus following years of deficits in all the three countries. This is 
mainly because there has been a very substantial fall in imports. Inflation has also declined, 
and in Estonia prices are now falling on an annual basis. However, these developments have 
also taken place at the expense of increased unemployment and impaired credit quality. This 
is reflected not least in the fact that late payments have increased dramatically.  
Although there are signs that the downturn is slowing down, the development of the Baltic 
states in the period ahead is still associated with several risks. The main challenge relates to 
government  finances  where  the  budget  deficits  have  grown  as  economic  activity  has 
weakened. The possibility to issue government securities to cover these deficits is, however, 
limited and Latvia is almost entirely dependent on the international support programme. Here 
there  is  also  a  great  need  for  reforms  in  the public sector,  reforms  that  should have  been 
carried out during the period of positive growth. Estonia is in a better initial position as during 
the good years of the decade the country took the chance to build up fiscal policy reserves 
that can now be used as an extra buffer to fund the budget deficit.  
Falling prices on the Baltic property market 
In terms of  financial stability, the development  of the Baltic property  market is of course a 
cause for concern. This development is in many ways reminiscent of the Swedish property

crisis.  Exaggerated  expectations  of  future  price  increases  pushed  up  prices,  particularly 
housing  prices.  Now  the  prices  of  both  commercial  properties  and  housing  have  fallen 
dramatically. For example, the average price of an apartment in Tallinn was more than 50 
lower in June 2009 compared to the peak in April 2007. This means that prices will soon be 
back at the level of 2004 (see Figure 10). In Latvia, the average price of apartments fell in the 
same period by almost 60 per cent, which is among the largest price falls noted in Europe 
during this crisis.6 In Lithuania, the fall in prices has been comparatively moderate: 28 per 
cent during the second quarter of this year compared to 2008.7  
We could say that after being a landlord's market for several years, the property market is 
now  a  tenant's  market.  In  an  economic  downturn,  it  is  common  for  landlords  to  offer  rent 
rebates or to refrain from increasing rents in line with the index to the full extent allowed in 
rental contracts. Lenders can also put pressure on the construction and property companies 
to increase the level of occupancy. This can lead to lower rents than those the construction 
cost  estimates  were  based  on  and  thus  give  rise  to  payment  difficulties  for  construction 
companies and property companies.  
As  I  have  said,  the  demand  for  properties  in  the  Baltic  states  is  very  low  at  present. 
Eventually, however, the countries will recover and demand will return. There is also a strong 
underlying demand for property in these countries as much of the property there is old (it was 
built in the Soviet era) and in need of renewal. As property prices are already so depressed, 
this may mean that prices will increase rapidly when the economic turnaround finally comes.  
Property also has a lasting value, providing that it is maintained. To the extent that the banks 
in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have taken properties as collateral it is probable that these 
properties  will  not  be  sold  until  there  is  an  upswing  in  demand.  This  is  what  happened 
following the Swedish property crisis in the early 1990s when Securum and other companies 
were specifically set up to manage the settlement of bad loans with property as collateral. 
The increasing market value of property in the  Baltic states will also eventually lead to an 
increase in the supply of new properties. An important precondition for all this is, however, 
that the internal reform programmes of the Baltic states are successful so that costs do not 
begin to rise once more.  
Small risk of a crisis on the Swedish property market  
In recent years, we have once again seen rapid price increases for commercial properties in 
Sweden. These prices have now begun to fall, however, and the question is whether this can 
lead  to  major  loan  losses  for  the  banks  in  the  same  way  as  it  did  during  the  crisis  of  the 
1990s (see Figure 11). The current downturn is after all much worse than that of the 1990s. I 
do not believe, however, that the effects on the property market will be so serious.  
The years prior to the property crisis of the 1990s were marked by a rapid rise in the price of 
office premises. This was mainly a result of the deregulation of the credit market as a pent-up 
demand  for  loans  led  a  rapid  expansion  of  credit.  A  large  part  of  the  loans  went  to  the 
property  sector,  where  optimism  was  high  as  a  result  of  the  favourable  situation  on  the 
market for office premises. The good times on the property market signalled the start of a 
construction  boom.  However,  when  the  downturn  came,  prices  fell  and  real  interest  rates

It is important to point out here that the statistics regarding property prices in the Baltic states are not complete 
and  difficult  to  access,  which  may  make  if  difficult  to  get  a  fair  picture  of  the  situation.  This  may  mean, 
therefore,  that  both  the  dramatic  increases  and  the  substantial  decreases  that  we  are  now  seeing  are 
exaggerated.  It  is  also  difficult  to  make  direct  comparisons  between  the  countries,  in  particular  over  short 
periods of time, as property prices are measured differently in different countries.

increased the crisis was upon us. As well all know, this entailed substantial loan losses for 
the banks.  
Today too, the property companies account for the banks' largest single exposure – almost 
20 percent of lending goes to this group of borrowers. This is, however, a lower figure than 
during the crisis of the 1990s when the banks' exposure to the property companies amounted 
to one third. But, despite the fact that the percentage is now lower, exposure is still at such a 
level that it can constitute a potential credit risk for Swedish banks. A similarity between the 
increase in prices we have just seen and the increase at the end of the 1980s is that prices 
were  not  driven  by  so-called  fundamental  factors.  In  other  words,  prices  increased  not 
because  of  a  higher  demand  for  offices,  lower  vacancy  rates  or  higher  rents  but  rather 
because the investors did not demand as high a return on their invested capital. This in turn 
indicates that higher rents were expected in the future.8 The risk premium was, for example, 
close to zero at the end of 2007. Investors did not thus compensate for the extra risk that a 
property investment entails compared to a risk-free investment such as a government bond. 
There  were,  however,  periods  in  the  1980s  when  the  risk  premium  was  negative.  The 
investors accepted a lower return on high-risk property investments than on safe investments 
in government bonds (see Figure 12).  
However,  there  are  also  major  differences  between  the  situation  on  the  Swedish  property 
market  then  and  now.  One  of  the  important  factors  that  made  it  possible  for  prices  to 
increase  so  much  during  the  latter  part  of  the  1980s  was  the  deregulation  of  the  credit 
market. Although lending to property companies has increased during the 2000s, this has not 
been to the same extent as in the years prior to the property crisis. The construction of new 
properties has also been moderate in recent years The most important difference, however, 
is  that  the  interest  rate  is  much  lower  today  now  that  monetary  policy  no  longer  needs  to 
focus on defending a fixed exchange rate (see Figure 13). The banks' credit assessments 
also focus more on the customers' cash flows and their ability to service their loans. In the 
1990s,  the  banks  focused  to  a  greater  extent  on  the  value  of  the  collateral,  and  as  the 
collateral for the loans was often in the form of property the value of the collateral fell quickly 
in pace with the fall in prices.  
With these differences in mind, we can note that it is unlikely that the fall in prices we have 
seen so far will lead to a crisis on the Swedish property market.  
However,  an  economic  downturn  is  always  associated  with  increased  risks.  During  the 
second quarter of this year, nominal prices for office premises in Stockholm, Gothenburg and 
Malmö fell by between 14 and 20 per cent on an annual basis. These are substantial price 
falls, although not as substantial as during the crisis of the 1990s. Prices began to fall in late 
2007  and  this  was  primarily  driven  by  that  fact  that  investors  increased  their  return 
requirements.  At  the  same  time,  rents  were  still  increasing  at  a  good  rate,  which 
counteracted  an  even  more  substantial  fall  in  prices.  However,  rents  began  falling  in  the 
spring, especially in Stockholm where the number of vacancies has also increased. Given 
that the outlook on the labour market is deteriorating and that bankruptcies are expected to 
increase among tenants, it is highly probable that vacancies will continue to increase. Such a 
development will reduce the earnings of the property companies, thus weakening their ability 
to make interest and amortisation payments. Ultimately, this may also lead to the suspension 
of payments on the part of property companies too. Falling prices may also cause difficulties 
for the property companies if they do not meet the banks' requirements regarding maximum 
leverage.  Some  property  companies,  which  before  the  current  crisis  funded  parts  of  their 
operations abroad, appear to be experiencing difficulties with their funding.

In simple terms one can say that the price of a property is determined by the expected operating surplus, that 
is rental income minus operating and maintenance costs, and by the investors' return requirement, which is 
the risk-free interest rate plus a risk premium. Investors are prepared to pay more for a property if they expect 
the rents to increase or if they do not require the capital they invest to generate such a high return.

Let me now say a few words about the Swedish housing market. Here, prices have not fallen 
in  anything  like  the  same  way  as  for  commercial  properties.  Despite  the  fact  that  we  are 
experiencing  the  severest  slump  of  the  post-war  period,  house  prices  fell  by  only 
approximately  two  percent  during  the  second  quarter  of  this  year  compared  to  the  same 
period last year. House prices in Sweden have so far fallen much less than in a number of 
other  industrial  countries  (see  Figure  14).  Several  of  these  countries,  for  example  Ireland, 
Spain  and  the  UK,  have,  however,  had  a  much  more  ioverheated  housing  market  than 
Sweden. Another reason why house prices in Sweden have not fallen as much may be that 
the Swedish banks have not been hit so hard by the financial crisis that they have found it 
difficult to lend money to the households. Incomes have also developed positively – at least 
for those who still have jobs. Another important explanation of why house prices have not 
fallen  more  is  that  the  real  interest  rates  faced  by  the  households  are  at  historically  low 
levels. The construction of new housing has also been at a low level since the crisis of the 
1990s.  This  is  despite  the  fact  that  in  most  of  the  large  urban  areas  it  pays  to  build  new 
house in comparison to what it costs to buy an existing house.9  
At the moment, when the crisis appears to have bottomed out and optimism has begun to 
grow,  housing  prices  are  beginning  to  increase  again,  especially  in  the  major  cities.  The 
Riksbank  will  closely  monitor  developments  in  the  period  ahead  with  regard  to  both  the 
housing market and the market for commercial properties.  
The Swedish banks can cope with large losses in the Baltic states 
In the deep recession that we are now experiencing, it is not possible to dismiss the fact that 
the Swedish banks are facing significant loan losses. During the first six months of this year, 
these losses amounted to SEK 30 billion, which translated into annual figures is equivalent to 
0.84  per  cent  of  total  lending.  A  large  part  of  these  losses,  44  per  cent,  stem  from  the 
Swedish  banks'  operations  in  the  Baltic  states.  The  Riksbank's  assessment  in  the  main 
scenario of the latest Financial Stability Report is that loan losses are expected to amount to 
just  over  2  per  cent  of  the  banks'  lending  in  2009  and  2010.  In  a  stress  scenario  that 
assumes a much worse situation in Sweden and in the Baltic states, the loan losses could 
amount to 4.3 per cent of lending during these two years. Almost 40 per cent of these losses 
in both the main scenario and the stress scenario can also be related to the banks' lending to 
the Baltic states and the rest of Eastern Europe. These are significant losses, even though 
they are not as large as those suffered during the Swedish bank crisis in the period 1991-
1994 when losses amounted to 13 per cent of lending.  
The banks' losses will certainly be largely related, in this crisis as in all others, to the situation 
on  the  property  market.  This  is  because  most  of  the  banks'  collateral  volume  consists  of 
property.  However,  the  problems  usually  relate  primarily  to  commercial  properties,  not  to 
housing.  The  households  service  their  interest  and  amortisation  payments  in  most  cases, 
even  though  they  may  sometimes  have  to  negotiate  a  respite  with  the  bank.  Neither  in 
Sweden nor in the Baltic states can households, as they can in the USA, give up the property 
they have provided as collateral and thus get rid of their debts. Not even during the crisis of 
the 1990s did the households account for a significant part of the banks' losses. However, 
although loans for housing seldom constitute major problems for the banks, they may mean 
disaster  for  individual  households  that  suddenly  find  it  difficult  to  make  the  payments.  At

In the economic literature this ratio is called Tobin's q after the Nobel Prize winner James Tobin who, among 
much else, has studied property prices. If Tobin's q is equal to 1, then the cost of buying an existing house is 
equal to the cost of building a new one. This means that if house prices increase so that the market value is 
higher than the replacement value, then it pays to build a new house as each invested krona is valued at more 
then one krona by the market. In several of our large cities, Tobin's q is between 1 and 2, or even higher. In 
many parts of Sweden, however, the value is  well below 1, which means that it does not pay to build new 
housing there.

present  the  interest  rate  is  very  low.  However,  our  forecast  indicates  that  the  Riksbank, 
following a period with a low interest rate, will need to raise the interest rate quite quickly in 
the  period  ahead.  It  is  therefore  particularly  important  that  the  banks  check  that  every 
household  that  borrows  money  can  cope  with  the  expected  interest  rate  increases  and 
potential losses of income. 
The major Swedish banks have strengthened their capital bases and in international terms 
appear  to  be  well  capitalised.  Three  of  the  four  major  banks  have  carried  out  new  issues 
since  last  autumn  and  Swedbank  will  soon  conduct  an  additional  new  issue  –  all  on  the 
private  market  and  without  government  guarantees.  In  many  countries,  where  the  banking 
systems  have  been  affected  by  the  current  crisis  to  a  greater  extent,  this  has  been 
impossible. In addition, all four major banks have strengthened their capital by reducing or 
cancelling dividends to shareholders for the previous year. It should be pointed out, however, 
that the danger has not yet passed. If the situation deteriorates more than expected, credit 
ratings  may  come  under  pressure  and  the  banks  may  experience  funding  difficulties  once 
again. 
The Riksbank's measures safeguard financial stability 
Since the financial crisis broke out, the Riksbank has entered into swap agreements with two 
of the Baltic states. We have made it possible for the Estonian central bank to swap Estonian 
kronor for Swedish kronor should the need arise, and for the Latvian central bank to borrow 
euros  direct  from  the  Riksbank.  The  aim  of  these  agreements  is  to  make  it  easier  for  the 
central banks in Estonia and Latvia to safeguard financial stability in the respective countries. 
Entering into these swap agreements also serves to safeguard financial stability in Sweden. 
In order to secure the supply of liquidity, the Riksbank has also lent kronor and dollars to the 
Swedish banks when they have not been able to acquire funding on the market. These loans 
have  been  provided  at  longer  maturities  than  normal  and  with  a  broader  spectrum  of 
collateral.  
In Europe and other parts of the world, central banks and supervisory authorities have faced 
many  new  problems  over  the  last  12  months,  not  least  with  regard  to  banks  that  have 
operations  in  several  countries.  The  experience  gained  is  now  the  subject  of  intensive 
discussion.  I  am  convinced  that  in  the  future  we  will  see  major  changes  regarding  the 
supervision and regulation of the banks and other financial operations. But I will gladly speak 
about this on another occasion. 
Concluding remarks  
Over the last 12 months we have experienced a financial crisis that is exceptional in many 
respects  in  the  sense  that  it  has  hit  more  players,  markets  and  types  of  asset  than  any 
previous crisis.  
Since  the  beginning  of  the  summer,  the  real  economy  has  begun  to  show  signs  of 
stabilisation, although from very low levels. In Asia, and not least in China and India, growth 
has begun to pick up again and this is having a noticeable effect at those companies that 
export  to  these  countries.  World  trade  is  beginning  to  stabilise  and  the  fall  in  GDP  has 
slowed  down.  The  reports  of  the  banks  and  companies  for  the  second  quarter  have  also 
been less negative than expected, which has given rise to somewhat greater optimism about 
the future. There are also signs that the financial markets are working more effectively. This 
is reflected, for example, in the fact that the credit spreads, that is the difference between the 
interest rates on corporate bonds and the interest rates on government bonds, have returned 
to  the  levels  that  applied  before  Lehman  Brothers  filed  for  bankruptcy  protection.  The 
difference  between  interbank  rates  and  the  expected  policy  rate  has  also  decreased  (see 
Figure 15). The credit markets are also steadily improving. Companies that just a few months 
BIS Review 105/2009 
 7
ago found it difficult to issue bonds now have access to the market again. Companies with a 
good  credit  rating  can  now  borrow  at  a  lower  cost,  at  longer  maturities  and  with  lower 
collateral  requirements  than  before  the  summer.  It  thus  appears  that  the  situation  on  the 
financial markets is beginning to ease and that confidence is slowly returning. This is in turn 
a precondition for the continuation of the recovery of the real economy. Global monetary and 
fiscal  policy  is  still  highly  expansionary  and  there  is  plenty  of  spare  capacity  in  most 
countries. It is not unreasonable to assume that a rapid recovery of the financial markets can 
also facilitate a more rapid recovery in the real economy.  
There are thus several reasons why it is reasonable to be cautiously optimistic. We must also 
remember, however, that we are still emerging from a severe recession and it may therefore 
take time before global demand recovers completely. Many banks in the world also have a 
lot of work to do before their balance sheets are free of impaired assets. From a Swedish 
perspective, economic development in the Baltic states still constitutes a significant risk.
