Bojan Marković: Why foreign analysts and investors view Serbian macro 
prospects so differently from domestic public 
Speech by Mr Bojan Marković, Vice Governor of the National Bank of Serbia, at the ICAP’s 
1st  Credit  Risk  Management  Conference,  organised  by 
ICAP  Serbia,  Belgrade, 
30 November 2011. 
 I should like to thank Mirko Djukic for comments and suggestions. 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
Recent  turbulences  in  world  financial  markets  have  led  to  a  rise  in  risk  premia  in  many 
countries. In case of Serbia, these pressures were moderate relative to regional peers, but 
one  cannot  be  too  cautious  and  should  be  prepared  to  act  swiftly  in  order  to  minimize 
negative impacts of current turbulences. 
Improving  or  maintaining  Serbia’s  sovereign  credit  rating  in  these  turbulent  times  is  a 
challenge of a great importance. This is because it ensures sustainable sources of financing 
at  a  lower  cost,  not  only  for  the  Government,  but  also  for  all  other  market  participants  – 
businesses, households, and banks, alike.  
The  Government  and  the  central  bank  can  best  contribute  to  improving  credit  rating  by 
pursuing policies that ensure long-term macroeconomic stability, such as: maintaining public 
debt at sustainable level, ensuring price stability in the medium term,  and providing stable 
and resilient financial system. Any attempt to „stimulate” the economy in an unsustainable 
way  would  jeopardize  these  goals,  leading  to  a  rise  in  the  country’s  risk  premium  and 
eventually hurting the very economy it was meant to help. 
Over  the  past  years  foreign  market  participants  and  credit  rating  agencies  recognized  an 
improvement  in  Serbia’s  macro  prospects.  Serbian  press,  however,  has  been  even  more 
deeply  than  usual  flooded  with  doom-and-gloom  commentaries  of  Serbian  economic 
performance during the crisis and especially its macro prospects for the future: 
“We are facing inconsistency and incoherency of domestic economic policy daily observed 
by investors” (Djordje Djukic, Biznis i finansije, June 2011), 
“Knocking on the IMF doors is a proof of a complete defeat of the domestic economic policy” 
(Zarko Ristic, Pravda, September 2011), 
“Domestic  economy  is  currently  in  a  position  of  Titanic  –  sending  SOS  signals” 
(SašaĐogović, Nacionalni Građanski, September 2009), 
“Economic collapse looms large” (Branislav Grujic, Novosti, August 2011). 
But  at  the  same  time,  Serbia  saw  its  credit  rating  upgraded,  becoming  one  of  the  few 
countries in the region with the credit rating above the pre-crisis level. In November 2010, 
Fitch changed Serbia’s credit outlook to stable from negative, in March 2011 S&P upgraded 
Serbia  to  BB  from  BB–,  and  in  November  2011  Fitch  confirmed  credit  rating  for  Serbia, 
despite  downgrades  in  many  regional  peers.  The  financial  analysts  worldwide  started 
becoming  more  positive  about  Serbian  medium-term  macroeconomic  and  currency 
prospects,  and  foreign  investors  started  investing  increasingly  in  Serbia  through  FDI  or 
portfolio investments: 
“Progress has been made regarding monetary policy effectiveness. The NBS has performed 
well and enhanced its credibility since the 2008–2009 crisis.” (Fitch, November 2011). 
“We believe the completion of the current IMF arrangement and the government’s intention 
to  conclude  discussions  surrounding  a  new  precautionary  IMF  agreement  by  around  mid-
year should further boost investment sentiment.” (Barclays Capital, April 2011) 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

“Serbia has set itself apart from other emerging-market economies in creating conditions to 
attract foreign investment that will fuel growth.” (Nomura Global Research, December 2010). 
“The  least  vulnerable  countries  are  Czech  Republic,  Poland  and  Serbia,  and  Turkey  and 
Russia  outside  the  CEE  area.  All  enjoying  high  profitability  of  their  banking  sectors,  low 
dependence  of  parent  banks’  funding  and  larger  domestic  banking  ownership”  (Standard 
Bank, August 2011), 
What caused such a dichotomy of opinions between foreign investors and domestic public? 
Among the key reasons for improved Serbian macro prospects in international analyses one 
would find the following: 
First, the external debt structure was changing patterns over the past year. Banks’ external 
funding sources increased in maturity. While the long-run debt made up 56% of banks’ total 
external debt in January 2010, it grew to 75% by October 2011. Also, corporates’ external 
debt  kept  shifting  from  cross-borders  towards  domestic  banking  sector  borrowing,  yielding 
several important consequences. Domestic debt is under the strong prudential supervision of 
the National Bank of Serbia. Furthermore, domestic real credit growth of 15.2% in 2010 and 
9.0%  p.a.  in  October  2011  indicates  the  growth  potential  of  the  Serbian  banking  sector. 
Finally, while the cross-border debt is exclusively in foreign currency, domestic debt is partly, 
and increasingly so, in dinars, reducing the level of FX exposure in the country. 
Second,  the  dinar  financial  market  is  steadily  developing,  and  the  NBS’s  strategy  of 
dinarisation  is  yielding  some  visible  results.  The  yield  curve  has  been  extended  from 
12 months in early 2010 to 36 months by March 2011. The longer maturities opened up the 
bond market to non-resident investors, since they are legally allowed to trade with long-term 
government  securities only.  The  hedging  market  is  also gaining  pace,  and  the bank  credit 
market is becoming increasingly dinarised. In October 2011, 30% of total loans to corporates 
and households was in dinars, whereas in February 2010 it was only 24%. This implies that 
around 40% of new loans in the past year were in dinars. 
Third, fiscal deficits in the past three years hovered around 4.5% of GDP, less than in many 
other European countries. In October 2010 the Law on Fiscal Responsibility was adopted, 
introducing the fiscal rule and establishing the Fiscal Council. In an effort to restrain public 
spending, public sector wages and pensions remained nominally frozen throughout 2009 and 
2010.  Public  debt  currently  stands  at  around  45%  of  GDP,  which  is  below  ratios  for  most 
Eurozone countries.

   the 
imbalance, 
importantly,  external 
largest  pre-crisis 
Finally,  and  perhaps  most 
macroeconomic problem, has been steadily adjusting since early 2009. In 2008, the current 
account deficit to GDP ratio reached the height of 21.6%, indicating large and unsustainable 
external  imbalance.  Since  then,  it  corrected  sharply  to  7.2%  in  2009  and  2010,  and  is 
estimated to be around 7.5% in 2011.  
For the current account deficit to improve to such an extent, it was necessary to increase net 
exports and investments and to cut real consumption. Indeed, in 2009 and 2010 net exports 
contributed to growth by 9.3 percentage points and 3.7 percentage points, respectively. In 
the  first  half  of  2011,  fixed  investments  led  GDP  growth,  contributing  with  1.2  percentage 
points. At the same time, real consumption kept falling by 3.4% in 2009, 0.2% in 2010, and 
2.7% in the first half of 2011, according to NBS estimates. 
Although  this  adjustment  was  necessary  in  order  to  achieve  sustainability  of  economic 
growth in Serbia, it, nevertheless, was extremely painful for Serbian consumers, especially 
since  summer  2010,  when  food  prices  shot  up  substantially  following  a  poor  agricultural 
season worldwide. 
And here lies the key reason for the difference of views between foreign investors and the 
Serbian  public.  While  foreign  investors  focused  on  improved  macroeconomic  sustainability 
brought about by shrinking consumption, the Serbian public was feeling strongly the pinch of 
the  necessary  adjustments  following  the  unsustainable  consumption  spree  in  the  years 
before the crisis. 
So, what should we do now? There are three choices in front of us: 
One could stop the adjustment process and engage in another consumption spree. This is 
clearly tempting for many of a short-term approach, as the policy of reckless spending too 
often stroke a cord with a part of the Serbian electorate in the past twenty or so years. But 
there  is  also  a  catch:  following  the  recent  crisis,  any  policy  leading  to  further  imbalances 
becomes much discriminated by international financiers, who are unlikely to keep financing 
such a spending as generously as before the crisis.  
Alternatively,  one  could  try  to  give  the  electorate  a  bit  of  a  break  from  further  sharp 
adjustments in the pre-election period. But, loosening the consumers belt for a year, will not 
do them much favours in the medium term, and might also trigger a swift negative reaction 
from  international  investors  at  the  time  when  they  are  particularly  sensitive  to  non-prudent 
public spending.

Finally,  and  in  my  opinion  most  desirably,  one  could  continue  with  necessary  painful 
adjustments,  while  at  the  same  time  providing  more  assistance  to  the  poorest  and  most 
vulnerable  households  among  us.  Although  politically  risky,  this  would  be  the  most 
responsible policy for the upcoming Serbian generations. 
And at this point I should like to reiterate the National bank of Serbia’s message over the past few 
years: it is better to have low but sustainable growth than high and unsustainable one. 
The National Bank of Serbia will continue with an effort to stabilize inflation at lower level and 
maintain sound financial system, which, I firmly believe, is the best way to help the economy 
in the current circumstances.  
A further challenge in front of us is to reduce credit risks related to FX exposure, as well as to 
exposure  to  interest  rate  fluctuations.  For  that  reason,  we  will  foster  the  development  of 
transparent  and  simple  hedging  instruments,  such  as  FX  forwards  and  swaps,  as  well  as 
interest  rate  swaps.  At  the  same  time,  following  an  adverse  financial  stability  effect 
internationally of some of the complex financial derivatives, such as CDSs, CDOs or NDFs, 
we would like to discourage the development of such instruments in Serbia at this stage of 
financial literacy in the country. 
Ladies  and  Gentlemen,  I  should  like  to  assure  you  that  the  National  Bank  of  Serbia  monitors 
international developments very carefully, both in the real and financial sectors, and stands ready 
to do everything and act in order to maintain macroeconomic and financial stability in Serbia.
