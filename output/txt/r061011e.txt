   Economic performance 
Economic growth has averaged around 2.4 percent over the past 5 years and is expected to 
average around 2.7 percent in the next 3 years. 
Investment  performance  has  increased  since  2001,  with  the  momentum  coming  from  the 
private sector. 
What are our key challenges? 
Challenge 1: Underperforming resource based sectors 
o 
Gold  production  has  performed  poorly  in  spite  of  favourable  international  prices 
recorded in recent years 
Forestry showing signs of recovery in the medium term 
Fisheries sector has shown some growth but is still below potential 
Mitigating factors: 
(cid:131) 
(cid:131) 
A company restructure is underway at the Vatukoula gold mine 
Incentives are being offered by Government for investment in agricultural 
production 
Greater public-private partnership is being encouraged 
Government  is  looking  at  ways  to  improve  market  access  for  these 
sectors 
Value adding initiatives are also being promoted 
(cid:131)

Challenge 2: Sugar 
o 
Sugar  production  is  far  below  its  potential  with  sugar  exports  performing  poorly 
when compared to previous years 
Preferential pricing is gradually being withdrawn: 
(cid:131) 
(cid:131) 
60 percent of Fiji’s sugar is exported to the EU market 
EU preferential price will undergo a 36 percent reduction over a period of 
4 years, beginning in 2006 
Around 2,800 farm leases will expire by 2008 
About 10,300 farm leases will be expiring over the next 25 years 
Expiring land leases also pose a challenge for the sector:

(cid:131) 
Mitigating factors: 
(cid:131) 
(cid:131) 
Sugar reforms are underway with support from the Indian Government 
ADB support through the Alternative Livelihoods Programme is ensuring 
that those displaced by the reforms have assistance 
EU support has also been promised

The multi-party system will facilitate the passage of land tenure legislation 
through Parliament 
Diversification  within  the  industry  to  produce  ethanol  is  also  being 
considered 
Challenge 3: Debt 
o 
o 
o 
Increasing Government debt is becoming an issue of sustainability 
While, the higher fiscal deficits in the past worked well to raise economic growth, 
we now need to relook at our strategy to secure sustainability 
Mitigating factors: 
(cid:131) 
Strategic  Development  Plan  2007-2011  has  a  strong  commitment  to 
lower deficits to around 2 percent in any year of the SDP plan period 
This is expected to help bring the level of Government debt down to 49 
percent of GDP by 2009 
(cid:131) 
Challenge 4: Balance of payments 
o 
o 
o 
o 
Strong demand is leading to an increase in imports 
Unfortunately, this is happening at a time when our exports are performing poorly 
This is unsustainable given that it is leading to a widening trade gap 
While a surplus from the services and transfers accounts are growing, the surplus 
generated is still insufficient to offset the trade gap 
As a result, our current account imbalance is worsening, thus placing pressure on 
Fiji’s balance of payments 
Mitigating factors: 
(cid:131) 
o 
o 
RBF  has  raised  interest  rates  to  quell  the  surge  in  consumption  driven 
demand 
Fiscal consolidation plans is a part of the SDP commitment 
This  means  that  there  will  be  greater  policy  coordination  between 
monetary and fiscal policy 
Government has successfully conducted an international bond issue 
National  Exports  Strategy  has  been  developed  in  order  to  raise  Fiji’s 
exports 
Alternative  sources  of  energy  are  being  pursued 
dependence on fuel imports 
Import substitution is being considered for relevant and viable areas 
to  reduce  our

What are our key strengths? 
Strength 1: Low external debt 
o 
Government  external  debt  has  been  on  a  declining  trend  since  1999  and  was 
around 3.6 percent of GDP or 6.8 percent of total Government debt by 2005 
This  declining  trend  in  external  debt  has  also  led  to  lower  debt  servicing 
commitments over the years with debt servicing ratio at 0.5 percent

This was to finance government capital projects and avoid crowding out 
the private sector at a time when liquidity conditions are tight 
With  very  low  external  debt,  there  is  much  room  for  government  to 
diversify its sources of borrowing externally 
Requirement of US$150 million 
Fiji  received  a  Ba2  rating  by  Moodys  and  a  BB  rating  by  Standard  & 
Poors – reflecting a stable outlook for the Fiji economy 
Results:  5  year  tenure;  initial  price  guidance  of  7.25  percent  was 
announced; 10 times oversubscribed (US$1.4 billion); finally priced with a 
coupon rate of 6.875 percent to yield 7.000 percent 
This  very  successful  debut  bond  issue  reflects  confidence  in  the  Fiji 
economy 
Strength 2: Low inflation 
o 
o 
Inflation in Fiji has been low, averaging around 3 percent over the last 10 years 
Reasons for low inflation: 
(cid:131) 
(cid:131) 
(cid:131) 
Fiji has a fixed exchange rate that serves as an anchor on prices 
Wage demands are relatively modest 
Good inflation management is practised by our major trading partners all 
of whom either explicitly or implicitly target inflation 
Good supply conditions for local market produce 
(cid:131) 
Strength 3: Robust tourism sector 
o 
The tourism industry is currently being touted as Fiji’s flagship industry, with future 
prospects looking very bright 
Fiji has been able to attract significant investment through this industry from major 
international hotel name brands 
Other supporting factors for this growing sector are:
