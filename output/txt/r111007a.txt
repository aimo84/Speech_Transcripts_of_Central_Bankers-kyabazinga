Svante Öberg: GDP growth and resource utilisation 
Speech by Mr Svante Öberg, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at Statistics 
Sweden’s annual conference, Saltsjöbaden, 6 October 2011. 
 It’s a pleasure to be back here in Saltsjöbaden again. It has now been ten years since I was 
involved  in  starting  these  annual  conferences  as  the  head  of  Statistics  Sweden.  In  those 
days, this was a matter of improving economic statistics. What several of the proposals we 
discussed  had  in  common  was  that  they  were  important  for  our  efforts  to  elucidate  and 
understand productivity growth. These proposals included a better price index in the private 
service  sector,  better  capital  stock  calculations,  better  input-output  statistics  and  better  IT 
statistics. I also considered that Statistics Sweden should do more to describe and analyse 
productivity growth. I am therefore very pleased to see that the conferences have come to 
focus on the important area of productivity growth and its causes.  
My speech today can be summed up in the following three points: 
 
Resource  utilisation  can  be  measured  in  several  different  ways,  among  others  as 
actual GDP in relation to potential GDP (the GDP gap). 
The financial crisis has lowered the growth rate of potential GDP. 
Resource utilisation is thus largely normal, even though GDP is only slightly higher 
than before the crisis. 
 I  will  start  by  describing  GDP  growth  over  the  longer  term.  Then,  I  will  address  resource 
utilisation’s significance for monetary policy, give an account of the Riksbank’s calculations of 
potential GDP, discuss the impact of the financial crisis on potential GDP, give an account of 
different  measures  of  resource  utilisation  and  what  they  say  about  resource  utilisation  at 
present, and conclude by addressing the need for continued analyses.  
GDP grows over time, but the rate of growth varies 
GDP growth since 1950 is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. What is known as an HP trend is 
also included in the figures. I will return to these HP trends later. Seen over the entire period 
from 1950 to 2010, GDP has increased by an average of 2.7 per cent per year. Growth was 
significantly  stronger  in  the  1950s  and  1960s  compared  with  the  1970s  and  1980s.  There 
then  followed  a  ten-year  period  from  the  mid-1990s  with  relatively  rapid  GDP  growth  and 
associated relatively rapid productivity growth.  
In earlier seminars, we have discussed the reasons for the strong productivity growth during 
this later period. I myself have pointed out a number of possible explanations.1 Globalisation 
through the expansion of the EU, the opening up of the economies of eastern Europe and 
China’s  rapidly-growing  international  trade  have  increased  competition,  which  has  been 
particularly significant for Sweden, with our substantial foreign trade and high proportion of 
international companies. Furthermore, a number of product markets were deregulated in the 
1990s (taxis, domestic flights, postal services, telecommunications, electricity etc.). Sweden 
also  has  high  proportions  of  IT  production  and  IT  use  in  production.  Last  year,  we  also 
discussed the significance of education, work organisation and intangible investments.

In conjunction with the financial crisis, GDP then fell by over five per cent in 2009, before 
rising again by over five per cent in 2010. Productivity in the economy as a whole, measured 
as GDP per hour worked, decreased for two consecutive years by a total of over four per 
cent. I will later address the possible reasons for this and the possible consequences. But I 
will start with the significance of resource utilisation for monetary policy. 
Resource utilisation is of great significance to monetary policy 
According to the Sveriges Riksbank Act, the objective for monetary policy is to maintain price 
stability.  At  the  Riksbank,  we  have  interpreted  this  to  mean  that  we  should  strive  to  hold 
inflation, measured in terms of the consumer price index, at two per cent per year. We have 
been  clear  about  the  CPI  being  the  target  variable.  But  we  also  follow  a  number  of  other 
inflation  measures  to  analyse  and  better  understand  the  development  of  inflation:  the  CPI 
with a fixed interest rate (CPIF), CPIF excluding energy, the EU-harmonised measure HICP 
and several measures of underlying inflation.2 
There are two reasons for the Riksbank to care about resource utilisation, in addition to price 
stability.  The  first  is  that  we  are  striving  to  attain  high  GDP,  high  employment  and  low 
unemployment, and resource utilisation is related to these targets. But we should only do this 
when  it  is  compatible  with  the  inflation  target.  The  inflation  target  takes  precedence.  This 
differs  from  the  United  States,  where  the  central  bank  has  the  double  target  of  achieving 
price stability and maximum employment. In addition, the preparatory works for the Sveriges 
Riksbank  Act  only  refer  to  “high”  employment  (as  compared  with  the  United  States’ 
”maximum” employment) and not to any particular level of unemployment.3 
The other reason to care about resource utilisation is that it serves as an indicator of future 
inflation.  The  positive  relationship between  resource  utilisation  and  inflation  is  illustrated  in 
Figure  3,  which  shows  the  correlation  between  three  different  measures  of  resource 
utilisation  and  CPIF  inflation  1–12  quarters  ahead.4  The  connection  is  fairly  strong  
3–8  quarters  ahead.  The  connection  is  stronger  and  faster  for  the  hours  gap  than  for  the 
GDP gap and the RU indicator. This may be because the development of the labour market 
usually follows behind output and because it is very important for the development of prices 
and  wages.  Of  course,  it  is  difficult  to  draw  any  conclusions  from  the  covariation  of  two 
variables,  but  the  same  type  of  relationship  also  exists  in  more  developed  empirically-
estimated models.  
Considering this, we wrote, in Monetary Policy in Sweden, that the Riksbank, in addition to 
achieving  low  and  stable  inflation,  should  also  strive  to  stabilise  output  and  employment 
around  long-term  sustainable  paths.5  This  means  that  we  also  strive  to  hold  resource 
utilisation at a normal level. We usually say that the Riksbank is thereby conducting a flexible 
inflation-targeting policy. We have also chosen to take a broad approach when it comes to 
interpreting  resource  utilisation,  instead  for  only  looking  at  a  single  measure  of  resource 
utilisation.

3  My colleague Lars Svensson has a different interpretation of our task, namely that, during the forecast period, 
we should strive to hold inflation measured in terms of the CPIF (the CPI with a fixed interest rate) as close to 
two per cent as possible and resource utilisation measured in terms of unemployment as close to an estimate 
of the long-term sustainable level of unemployment as possible. See, for example Lars E.O. Svensson, “For a 
better monetary policy: Focus on inflation and unemployment”, 8 March 2011. 
4  The figure is based on the ten-year period 1997–2006. This period is not extended further than 2006 so as not 
to be affected too much by the period after the outbreak of the financial crisis in the autumn of 2008. However, 
the differences do not become so great even if the years 2007 and 2008 are included.

The Riksbank’s calculations of potential GDP 
Resource utilisation can be measured in several different ways. Here, I will demonstrate how 
we,  at  the  Riksbank,  calculate  measurements  of  resource  utilisation  based  on  GDP  and 
potential GDP, as well as hours worked and potential hours worked. Potential GDP refers to 
the level of GDP that is consistent with a use of the available resources that is sustainable in 
the long term and that does not push up inflation. If GDP exceeds the potential level, then 
resource  utilisation  is  high  –  and  vice  versa.  We  call  the  difference  between  actual  and 
potential GDP the GDP gap.6 When resource utilisation is normal, GDP is equal to potential 
BNP, and the GDP gap is equal to zero. Consequently, potential GDP does not refer to the 
highest level GDP may reach over the short term. 
In Figure 1, the trend development of GDP is represented by a Hodrick-Prescott trend (HP 
trend). An HP trend is something between a linear trend and the actual development of GDP. 
The  HP  trend  is  a  common  and  often  fairly  good  measure  of  the  underlying  long-term 
development  in  GDP  during  normal  cyclical  fluctuations.  But  the  HP  trend  is  not  good  at 
estimating the underlying development of GDP at the end of a time series and it gives no 
guidance as to why output deviates from its trend level.  
The production function approach 
On the other hand, our ability to analyse why output deviates from its long-term level can be 
improved if a production function (PF) approach is used. This is a common technique used by 
international organisations such as the IMF and the OECD. The Riksbank has used such an 
approach since 2010.7 A production function shows how output depends on production factors 
and technological level. In the most common case, we may consider that output (Y) depends 
on the number of hours worked (H), the capital stock (K) and total factor productivity (TFP). 
The level of TFP determines how much output is derived from a given amount of hours and 
capital.8 TFP can thus be seen as a measure of the level of technology. By specifying a form 
for the production function, the following breakdown is obtained:9 
 The  wage  share  in  the  economy  is  usually  about  two-thirds,  which  is  why  hours  are 
considered  to  stand  for  two-thirds  of  the  production  factors  (
)  and  capital  for  the 
  ).  The  contribution  of  each  factor  to  output  can  then  be  calculated. 
remaining  third  (
Output increases through more capital weighted by a third, more hours worked weighted by 
two thirds and improved TFP.  
But,  in  practice,  it  is  difficult  to  measure  TFP. Instead,  it must  normally  be  estimated  as  a 
residual,  often  called  a  Solow  residual  after  Nobel  Prize  winner  Robert  Solow.  The  output 
that does not depend on the input factors of capital and labour is assigned to TFP.

In  the  original  Taylor  rule,  the  policy  rate  is  determined  by  inflation  and  the  GDP  gap.  See  Taylor,  J.B., 
“Discretion  versus  policy  rules  in  practice”,  Carnegie-Rochester  Conference  Series  on  Public  Policy,  North-
Holland, 1993. 
7  See the article “The driving forces behind trends in the economy can be analysed using a production function” 
in the Monetary Policy Report of October 2010. 
It is important to make a distinction between labour productivity, which is defined as output per hour, and total 
factor productivity.

9  This is the logarithm of what is known as a Cobb-Douglas function: 
the relationship in the text applies to the logarithms of Y, K, H and TFP.

In  accordance  with  the  production  function,  the  potential  level  of  production  can  also  be 
divided up into potential total factor productivity, potential capital stock and potential hours. 
Deviations from the potential level can be estimated for each of the three factors affecting 
output – capital, hours worked and TFP. These deviations can then be weighted together to 
give a total output gap.  
Calculations of potential GDP 
This  section  describes  the  calculations  forming  the  basis  for  the  GDP  and  hours  gap 
published in the most recent Monetary Policy Update.10 
Figure 4 shows an estimate of actual and potential TFP. Actual TFP is estimated with the 
Solow  residual.  The  TFP  estimate  thus  captures  all  change  in  output  that  cannot  be 
explained by the development of capital and hours. Potential TFP is estimated with an HP 
trend based on the Solow residual. The idea is that the TFP estimate will describe technical 
developments.  But,  among  other  factors,  it  is  also  affected  by  the  fact  that  the  production 
factors’ degree of utilisation varies over time. Estimating TFP is thus the most uncertain part 
of  applying  the  PF  approach.  The  assessment  made  was  that  actual  TFP  at  present  was 
largely the same as potential TFP. 
Figure 5 shows the development of the capital stock or, more precisely, the flow of services 
from  the  capital  stock.  In  this  connection,  it  is  assumed  that  the  actual  capital  stock 
corresponds  with  the  potential  capital  stock.  The  development  of  the  capital  stock  in  the 
period ahead has been based on the Riksbank’s investment forecast.  
Figure 6 shows the development of the number of hours worked and the potential level of 
these.  The  development  of  potential  hours  in  the  future  is  determined  by  demographic 
developments, the assumption that there will be a trend increase in labour force participation 
among  older  people  and  an  assessment  of  the  effects  of  economic  policy.  These 
assessments  have  led  to  the  potential  number  of  hours  worked  presently  exceeding  the 
indications of the HP trend.  
Figure  7  shows  GDP  and  two  measures  of  potential  GDP:  the  HP  trend  and  the  PF 
approach. The difference between potential GDP calculated with the HP trend and with the 
PF  approach  is  not  so  large.  The  most  important  difference  between  the  measures  is  the 
potential development of hours. In the PF approach, the development of potential hours is 
based on assessments with no HP trend element.  
Figures 8 and 9 show the measures of resource utilisation based on GDP and potential GDP, 
in  addition  to  hours  worked  and  potential  hours  worked,  that  were  the  result  of  these 
calculations. They indicate that resource utilisation is largely normal this year. The GDP gap 
based on the HP filter is slightly higher than normal, while the GDP gap based on the PF 
approach is slightly lower than normal. The reason for the difference lies in the assessment 
of  the  potential  number  of  hours  worked.  The  hours  gap  based  on  the  HP  filter  is  slightly 
higher  than  normal,  while  the  hours  gap  used  in  the  PF  approach  is  slightly  lower  than 
normal.  
Difficulties in calculations, but reasonable view of present situation 
There  are  several  problems  with  the  method  of  calculating  potential  GDP  I  have  just 
described. Among others, these include the calculations of potential labour, capital stock and 
TFP. The difficulty of assessing potential GDP is also illustrated by the way that assessments 
of  the  GDP  gap  have  changed  over  time.  Attention  has  been  drawn  to  this,  not  least  by

Orphanides.11 Among other observations, he shows that the estimates of the GDP gap for the 
United  States  for  a  certain  year,  made  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  have 
changed  radically  between  the  various  dates  of  calculation,  and  draws  the  conclusion  that 
GDP growth should be focused on as the basis for monetary policy, rather than the GDP gap. 
Figure 10 presents estimates of the GDP gap in real time and in accordance with the most 
recent calculation from September 2011. The estimates in real time show what we believed 
the current GDP gap to be at the various previous forecasting occasions. The figure indicates 
that resource utilisation was higher in the years preceding the crisis than we believed at the 
time.  However,  there  are  also  problems  with  estimating  resource  utilisation  in  retrospect, 
which mean that such calculations may perhaps overestimate how high resource utilisation 
was before the crisis. I will come back to this. 
Despite these difficulties, my assessment is that the Riksbank’s calculations of the GDP gap 
largely  give  a  reasonable  view  of  current  resource  utilisation.  The  decisive  factor  for  this 
assessment  is  that  the  GDP  gap  currently  corresponds  with  other  ways  of  measuring 
resource utilisation that are based on other economic statistics. These other measures also 
show that resource utilisation is largely normal. I will review a number of such measures at a 
later point.  
In contrast, I do not think that the GDP gap provides a reasonable view of the development 
of  resource  utilisation  over  the  course  of  recent  years.  I  shall  return  to  this  shortly.  First, 
however, I would like to address the effects of the financial crisis on potential GDP, as this 
plays an important role in the assessment of the GDP gap. 
The financial crisis has had a negative effect on potential GDP 
The financial crisis has probably lowered the potential growth rate.12 There may be several 
reasons for this. The capital stock has been negatively affected by the financial crisis through 
the decrease of the investment level. Growth in the capital stock has come to a halt. Even 
though we expect investments to recover quite strongly in the period ahead, the capital stock 
will not reach the pre-crisis trend level.  
The labour force has probably also been affected negatively due to exclusion from the labour 
market,  with  competence  among  the  labour  force  being  undermined  by  long  periods  of 
unemployment. However, this reduction of the labour supply due to the crisis has been more 
than  counteracted  by  an  economic  policy  focused  on  increasing  labour  force  participation. 
The number of people in the labour force has increased in recent years due to this.  
The  most  important  factor,  which  is  also  the  most  difficult  to  explain,  is  that  total  factor 
productivity also fell during the most recent crisis. It is, of course, normal for productivity to 
develop less strongly at the start of a recession. But the heavy fall of just over six per cent 
that occurred between the third quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 was abnormally 
large. This was probably partially due to a decrease of the degree of utilisation of capital and 
labour.  
According  to  Figure  8, actual  GDP  and  potential  GDP  were  largely  the  same  in  1995  and 
2005. As the estimate of potential GDP was not seriously affected by terminal point problems 
or deep recessions in these years, it probably provides a reasonable view of potential GDP. 
This is also supported by data on economic activity that shows that resource utilisation was 
largely normal in these years. The average rate of growth in GDP between 1995 and 2005

12  Experiences of earlier financial crises are described in detail in Reinhart, C.M. and Rogoff, K.S., “This time is 
different: eight centuries of financial folly”, Princeton University Press, 2009.

was 3.1 per cent per year. Consequently, this is also the average rate of growth of potential 
GDP during this period.  
According to Figure 8, actual GDP and potential GDP were also roughly the same in 2011. 
Between 2005 and 2011, both GDP and potential GDP have thus increased by an average of 
2.0  per  cent  per  year.  A  projection  of  GDP  from  2005  according  to  the  earlier  trend  of 
three per cent per year would have given a GDP level about six per cent higher than actual 
GDP in 2011. Even if this is only a mathematical example and the potential growth, if there 
had been no financial crisis, is assumed to be significantly lower than three per cent per year, 
it  still  shows  that  the  financial  crisis  put  a  dent  in  the  long-term  upwards  development  of 
potential GDP.13 
The  lowered  rate  of  growth  of  potential  GDP  after  the  financial  crisis  corresponds  with 
international experiences. In conjunction with financial crises, it is normal for GDP growth to 
be lower in the ten years following the crisis than in the ten years before the crisis.14 
But  the  financial  crisis  primarily  affected  Sweden  through  reduced  exports,  not  through 
problems in the banking sector. It is thus not self-evident that the rate of growth of potential 
GDP should necessarily be lower in Sweden. One explanation may be that the rate of growth 
of  potential  GDP  does  not  only  decrease  in  conjunction  with  financial  crises,  but  also  in 
conjunction with deep recessions. We have seen in earlier crises, in the late 1970s and early 
1980s, as well as in the early 1990s, that a deep recession can have this effect. On these 
occasions,  GDP  did  not  reach  the  pre-crisis  trend  level  for  the  next  ten  years.15  Another 
explanation may be that Sweden, with its high international dependence, cannot isolate itself 
too much from developments abroad. There are also rigidities in the economy that mean that 
it will take time before a sharp fall in exports can be replaced by an increase of exports or by 
an increase of domestic demand that fully compensates for this decline.  
I actually think it is more reasonable to concentrate the negative effect on potential GDP to 
the period immediately after the start of the financial crisis, rather than to spread it out over a 
larger number of years before and after the financial crisis in the way that both the HP trend 
and the PF approach do. This would mean that the GDP gap would not appear so high in 
2008 and perhaps not so low in 2009 either. But this is unimportant for the assessment of 
resource utilisation this year.  
Resource utilisation is largely normal 
My assessment is thus that resource utilisation is largely normal. The measures of resource 
utilisation that I showed earlier in Figures 8 and 9 indicated this. But it is also supported by 
other measures of resource utilisation, based on questions to individuals and companies. An 
additional  advantage  of  measures  of  this  type  is  that  they  can  be  seen  directly  in  the 
statistics, thus avoiding the problems associated with HP trends and PF approaches.  
Figure  11  shows  such  a  measure,  capacity  utilisation  in  the  manufacturing  sector  from 
Statistics  Sweden  (SCB).  It  is  now  more  or  less  on  the  average  level  for  the  period  
1996–2008.  Another  measure  of  this  type  is  the  employment  rate  from  the  labour  force 
surveys  (AKU),  which  shows  the  proportion  of  the  population  of  working  age  that  is  in 
employment. Figure 12 shows that the employment rate this year is close to the average for 
the years 2000–2008.

The  Riksbank’s  indicator  of  resource  utilisation  (the  RU  indicator)  summarises  about  thirty 
such economic variables regarding levels.16 The RU indicator includes survey data from the 
National Institute of Economic Research’s Economic Tendency Survey for private services, 
the  retail  trade  and  the  construction  and  manufacturing  industries.  In  addition,  capacity 
utilisation  in  the  manufacturing  sector  from  Statistics  Sweden,  the  employment  rate  and 
unemployment  from  the  labour  market  surveys,  and  unfilled  vacancies  from  the  Swedish 
Public  Employment  Service  are  also  included.  According  to  the  RU  indicator,  resource 
utilisation is slightly higher than normal (see Figure 13).  
Figure 14 shows unemployment together with an average for the period 2000–2008 and an 
assessment  of  long-term  unemployment.17  Seasonally-adjusted  unemployment  is  presently 
higher  than  this  long-term  level.  But  assessments  of  long-term  unemployment  are  fraught 
with great difficulties. It is possible that the financial crisis will lead to an increase of long-term 
unemployment. At the same time, it is possible that the measures adopted in recent years 
will lead to a reduction of long-term unemployment. The net outcome of these two opposing 
forces will eventually become clear. 18 
At the same time as the unemployment gap is positive (see Figure 15), there is a shortage of 
labour in many sectors and in the business sector as a whole (see Figure 16). This indicates 
that matching on the labour market has deteriorated. This is also supported by the fact that 
the  Beveridge  curve,  which  shows  the  connection  between  the  number  of  persons 
unemployed and the number of unfilled vacancies, has shifted outwards (see Figure 17). The 
composition of the category unemployed has also changed. For example, the proportion of 
unemployed  people  with  brief  and  incomplete  educations  has  increased.  All  in  all,  for  my 
part,  I  interpret  this  to  mean  that  resource  utilisation  with  regard  to  labour  is  also  largely 
normal. 
The most recent Monetary Policy Update included the assessment that resource utilisation 
was somewhat lower than normal, but that it would be largely normal towards the end of the 
forecast  period.  My  overall  assessment  at  the  monetary  policy  meeting  was  instead  that 
resource  utilisation  was  already  normal,  and  I  have  taken  the  opportunity  to  explain  my 
judgement in a little more depth in this speech. The different measures of resource utilisation 
that I have addressed today are summarised in Table 1. 
We need more knowledge of productivity growth 
Today, I have given you an account of how the Riksbank tries, in various ways, to assess 
how  large  resource  utilisation  is.  One  of  the  measures  of  resource  utilisation  that  we  use 
compares actual GDP with an estimate of potential GDP. The financial crisis has probably 
lowered the growth rate of potential GDP. Actual GDP is thus roughly equal to potential GDP 
at  present,  even  though  GDP  is  only  slightly  higher  than  it  was  before  the  crisis.  My 
assessment  is  also  that  resource  utilisation  is  largely  normal.  This  assessment  is  also 
supported by other measures of resource utilisation that are not associated with such large 
problems in calculation. 
Resource  utilisation  has  a  positive  relationship  with  future  inflation.  Resource  utilisation  is 
thus  also  an  indicator  of  future  inflation.  It  is  therefore  important  to  be  able  to  reliably 
estimate  the  level  of  resource  utilisation.  But  the  financial  crisis  and  the  associated  deep 
recession  have  greatly  increased  uncertainty  in  estimates  of  resource  utilisation.  Different

assessments of the level of resource utilisation can lead to different views of how monetary 
policy ought to be conducted.  
It is therefore essential that more analyses are conducted to better understand what it is that 
determines the development of output and potential GDP in conjunction with financial crises 
and deep recessions. One important factor behind the development of potential GDP seems 
to  be  total  factor  productivity  (TFP).  This  is  particularly  troublesome  as  TFP  itself  is  often 
counted  as  an  unexplained  residual.  One  possible  way  forward  could  be  to  combine  the 
production  function  approach  with  economic  short-term  statistics  to  analyse  how  TFP 
behaves  in  normal  cyclical  fluctuations  and  in  deep  recessions.  The  almost  unique
