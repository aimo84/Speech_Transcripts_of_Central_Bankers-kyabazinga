 Svein Gjedrem: Monetary policy, securities markets and municipalities 
Address by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the anniversary 
seminar, Kommunalbanken, 30 August 2002. 
Please note that the text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation 
 In my address today I will touch on three themes. First, I will discuss monetary policy and its influence 
on  municipalities’  financial  position,  followed  by  some  remarks  on  the  Norwegian  bond  market  and 
Kommunalbanken AS. I will then conclude with some reflections on the challenges associated with the 
pension system and the interplay with securities markets.  
Municipalities’ financial position and monetary policy  
Guidelines for economic policy
• Fiscal policy:
- guideline for use of petroleum revenues:
• use real return on Petroleum Fund
• smooth fluctuations in the economy
• Monetary policy:
- inflation target
SG Kommunalbanken, 30.august  2002
 Norway’s economic policy is based on the guidelines for fiscal and monetary policy. The guideline for 
fiscal policy states that the use of petroleum revenues over the central government budget shall be 
equivalent to the expected real return on the Government Petroleum Fund. Most of the phasing in of 
petroleum revenues will take place over the next ten years. With a 4 per cent return on the Petroleum 
Fund, the use of petroleum revenues will rise to almost 5 per cent of mainland GDP in 2010.  
The objective of monetary policy
• Monetary policy is to be oriented towards low and 
stable inflation.
• The inflation target is set at 2.5 per cent.

 Monetary policy is oriented towards low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. 
When monetary policy is geared towards stabilising inflation, it also contributes to stabilising demand 
and  production.  Low  and  stable  inflation  fosters  stability  in  the  economy.  The  inflation  target  is  the 
nominal anchor for the Norwegian economy.  
Low inflation  is the objective,  and the  interest rate is the instrument. Monetary  policy functions  with 
considerable and variable lags. The current level of inflation does not provide an adequate basis for 
determining  the  level  at  which  interest  rates  should  be  set  today.  Our  analyses  indicate  that  a 
substantial  share  of  the  effect  of  an  interest  rate  change  will  occur  within  two  years.  Two  years  is 
therefore a reasonable time horizon for attaining the inflation target. 
Economic agents can act on the assumption that the inflation rate will be close to 2½ per cent over 
time. If it appears that  inflation,  with unchanged interest rates,  will be higher than  2½ per cent,  the 
interest rate will be increased. If it appears that inflation, with unchanged interest rates, will be lower 
than 2½ per cent, the interest rate will be reduced. There is symmetry here. It is just as important to 
avoid a rate of inflation that is too low as it is to avoid a rate that is too high. 
Changes  in  labour  costs  influence  the  rise  in  prices  for  domestically  produced  goods  and  services. 
Labour market tightness is heavily influenced by demand for goods and services. High levels of private 
and public consumption, investment and exports will sustain the demand for labour. When the supply 
of labour is limited, competition for labour pushes up wages.

 In many countries, low and stable inflation is the goal of monetary policy. It can therefore be assumed 
that imported inflation  will  remain subdued.  But, the  rise in prices  will still  vary  as a result of global 
economic developments. The krone exchange rate also plays an important role in determining import 
prices.  A  strong  krone  will  curb  prices  for  imported  goods. When  there  is  a  rise  in  interest  rates  in 
Norway and a widening differential between domestic and foreign interest rates, investments in NOK 
increase, and the krone exchange rate appreciates.

 BIS Review 48/2002
 Interest rates are higher in Norway than in most other OECD countries. This is a direct result of the 
markedly higher level of nominal wage growth in Norway. Wage growth has ranged between 5 and 7 
per cent every year since 1998. This year’s wage settlement appears to be following suit. Strong wage 
growth is the result of a tight labour market.  
Wage increases in this year’s settlements were high. Wage settlements in the internationally exposed 
sector did not set the trend for wages. Wage growth in several sheltered sectors, including the local 
government sector, is likely to be considerably higher. This is a break with the pattern observed a few 
years ago.  
The  phasing  in  of  petroleum  revenues  increases  demand  for  labour  in  the  public  sector  and  in 
enterprises selling goods and services to households. The contest for labour is reflected in high wage 
growth and a deterioration in competitiveness in exposed industries. 
Many enterprises in the sheltered sector can, in principle, pass on higher labour costs to customers. 
Monetary policy must reduce the possibility of passing on these costs in order to keep inflation at bay. 
This is done partly by keeping growth in demand for goods and services under control. In addition, a 
strong krone may boost imports of goods and services previously reserved for domestic producers.  
In  rural  areas  and  towns,  where  local  government  employment  is  an  alternative  to  working  in 
agriculture,  fisheries,  local  services  or  small-scale  industry,  the  public  sector  with  its  nationwide 
agreements  can  be  a  wage  trend-setter.  Wage  growth  in  the  public  sector  can  therefore  be  an 
important source of higher inflation.  
In the public sector, higher labour costs due to costly income settlements can only be passed on to 
customers to a limited extent. On the other hand, the rise in costs can intensify pressures to increase 
government allocations. Most likely, the central government will be expected to pick up the bill when 
labour costs rise sharply.  
In the business sector – with its profitability requirements – higher labour costs must be matched by an 
increase  in  productivity.  In  principle,  the  central  government  will  apply  the  same  requirements  to 
government agencies. How these requirements will be met in practice will have a decisive impact on 
developments in central government expenditure and, consequently, on interest rates and the krone 
exchange rate.

SG Kommunalbanken, 30.august  2002
  Growth in  public spending between 2001 and 2002  is estimated at 7 per cent.  This is considerably 
higher than growth in private sector mainland GDP, which is estimated at around 4 per cent. The fiscal 
guideline is then closely adhered to. Real growth in public consumption is estimated at 1½ per cent. In 
other words, growth in production of public services will be moderate, even though public spending is 
rising sharply in nominal krone terms. This is because the cost of producing public services is rising 
sharply, reflecting high wage growth in the public sector. There have also been substantial increases 
in transfers to the household sector through social security schemes. The bulk of the high growth in 
central  government  allocations  therefore  translates  into  strong  growth  in  household  income  and 
BIS Review 48/2002

 consumption. This tends to be the result when wage and costs pressure are already at such a high 
level. If the central government were to compensate public sector entities for the high wage increases, 
the result could easily be a new round up the wage spiral.  
The high level of interest rates and the strong krone reflect real economic driving forces, such as a 
high  level  of  petroleum  revenues,  a  tight  labour  market  and  strong  growth  in  household  income, 
consumption and borrowing. In addition, a shift in the wage formation process may have added to the 
particularly high rate of overall wage growth. If these forces are restrained, there is also hope that the 
pressures on monetary policy will subside.  
The bond market 
Market  interest  rate  rates  determine  the  compensation  afforded  to  savers  for  abstaining  from 
consuming today and the price the investor has to pay for borrowing the savings of other agents. The 
financial sector is the intermediary that channels savings to profitable investment projects and seeks to 
achieve  optimal  use  of  existing  capital.  The  financial  system  should  also  enable  borrowers  and 
investors  to  diversify  risk.  Banks  and  securities  markets  ensure  the  distribution  of  capital  and  risk 
management.  
• The financial system has been subjected to 
shocks:
• Cyclical downturn in the major industrial countries
• The IT share bubble burst
• Terror attacks in the US
• Argentina "bankrupt”
• Confidence eroded
• Large-scale fraudulent accounting practices by US 
companies
SG Kommunalbanken, 30.august  2002
 In  the  last  few  years,  the  financial  sector  has  been  under  considerable  strain.  There  has  been  a 
downturn in the major industrial countries, a collapse in technology stocks, terror attacks in the US and 
default  on  government  debt  in  Argentina.  Equity  prices  have  plummeted  and  bond  defaults  have 
increased sharply. The scandal at the energy company Enron and the recently disclosed fraudulent 
accounting practices at several US companies have eroded confidence in securities markets and the 
financial system. 
One role of securities markets is to ensure that the risk linked to various investments is reflected in 
borrowing  costs  and  expected  returns,  which  are  adjusted  continuously  through  market  price 
mechanisms. For price mechanisms to function effectively, it is essential that there is confidence in the 
information and results published. The US authorities have already taken measures to prevent further 
accounting and audit scandals. Several initiatives are also expected to be taken internationally. 
Smoothly  functioning  securities  markets  make  an  important  contribution  to  a  stable  and  efficient 
financial system. Without securities markets’ contribution to risk diversification, it is highly unlikely that 
the financial system could have coped as well as it did with the shocks of recent years. 
Norway  has  a  well  developed  financial  system.  Financial  institutions  such  as  banks,  mortgage 
companies  and  insurance  companies  channel  assets  and  debt  between  economic  agents.  In  the 
securities  market,  capital  is  channelled  directly  from  lender  to  borrower  through  the  use  of 
standardised debt and equity instruments in the primary market. Securities can also be traded in the 
secondary  market.  Substantial  volumes  of  debt  and  equity  instruments  are  traded  daily  among 
operators. The debt market consists of bonds and short-term debt instruments, while the equity market 
is essentially made up of stocks.

 The Norwegian bond market is very small on an international scale, whether it is the government bond 
market or the private bond market. Corporate debt  issues in Norway are more limited than in most 
comparable countries. The chart shows that this market is also small in a Nordic context. 
Foreign investors have recently shown a growing interest in NOK-denominated bonds as a result of 
strong growth in the Euro-krone market. This is the result of the relatively high level of interest rates in 
Norway. International operators are issuing NOK-denominated bonds on a large scale. At the same 
time, this provides life insurance companies and  investment funds  with an investment alternative  in 
NOK.

 The  largest  holders  of  Norwegian  bonds  are  insurance  companies,  but  the  government,  private 
companies and foreign investors also account for a large share of bond holdings. The largest issuers 
are the government and financial institutions. 
Kommunalbanken is also a fairly large issuer in the Norwegian bond market. At the end of 2001, the 
Bank’s  total  bond  and  commercial  paper  debt  came  to  about  NOK  26  billion.  This  accounted  for  a 
good 6 per cent of total outstanding bond and short-term debt issues in Norway at the end of last year.  
There are historical reasons for the thin securities market in Norway. From the post-war period and up 
to the beginning of the 1980s, the Norwegian bond market was subject to direct regulation. It was only 
in the late 1980s that the market for bonds and short-term debt was liberalised and it is now part of the 
international market.

 The  turnover  and  issue  volume  in  the  market  increased  sharply  up  to  the  mid-1990s.  However, 
Norwegian companies use the bond market on a far more limited scale than companies in comparable 
countries.  
Solid state finances also help to explain the limited size of the private bond market in Norway. A well 
functioning government bond market can stimulate the private segment of the debt securities market. 
In  most  countries,  the  state  has  a  sizeable  borrowing  requirement,  with  a  high  level  of  debt.  Even 
though its borrowing requirement is small, the Norwegian government also places emphasis on a well 
functioning bond market in its government debt policy. Government debt issues are confined to few 
and large standardised loans. This contributes to higher turnover in the secondary market and hence 
greater liquidity. With ample liquidity and low risk, government bond rates can serve as a benchmark 
for private bonds.

 The interest rate  on  private debt securities  is heavily influenced by the interest rate  on comparable 
government  securities.  Private  issuers  have  to  pay  a  somewhat  higher  interest  rate  than  the 
government  because  they  have  a  lower  credit  rating.  Another  factor  is  the  liquidity  of  the  debt 
instruments. The rate differential between government securities and private debt securities therefore 
consists  of  both  a  credit  risk  premium  and  a  liquidity  premium.  Normally,  the  larger  and  more 
developed the market is, the lower the liquidity premium is. The financial position of local government 
in relation to the central government ensures that there is little or no credit risk linked to the bonds 
issued  by  Kommunalbanken  or  municipalities.  Because  of 
liquidity  premium,  however, 
Kommunalbanken and the municipalities would benefit from a more developed and more liquid bond 
market in Norway.

 I can find several reasons why the Norwegian economy would benefit from a larger portion of credit 
being channelled through the debt securities market.

- Continuous pricing of risk reduces the possibility of 
- Provides the financial system with two legs to stand

on
SG Kommunalbanken, 30.august  2002
 Enhanced risk management  
a) 
Bonds and short-term issues are traded in the secondary market. More participants are thereby given 
the opportunity to invest in assets that have largely been reserved for financial institutions. Banks are 
also  provided  with  increased possibilities to diversify the risk in their loan portfolios across different 
sectors and regions. All in all, this contributes to spreading the credit risk linked to the loans. When risk 
is diversified, the financial system is less vulnerable in the face of financial turbulence. 
Continuous pricing of risk reduces the possibility of shocks 
b) 
Loans from financial institutions and securities debt differ widely in terms of the degree of transparency 
in credit rating and pricing. The credit rating in financial institutions must be looked upon as internal 
company  information.  Loans  provided  by  banks  and  financial  institutions  are  far  less  liquid  than 
negotiable securities and the price will generally not change as a result of new information about the 
borrower.  On  the  other  hand,  securities  markets  are  subject  to  transparency  and  information 
requirements. Participants’ credit ratings are continuously reflected in the transparent pricing process 
in the market.  
The stability in our financial system is strengthened when market operators’ assessment of the correct 
value  is  reflected  transparently  and  continuously  in  prices.  A  precondition  is  of  course  that  the 
information that companies are obliged to provide is correct. Economic shocks will also be more easily 
absorbed,  even  though  considerable  price  changes  may  have  substantial  wealth  effects.  Because 
banks  lend  at  relatively  fixed  rates,  financial  institutions  must  be  able  to  adjust  volumes  when  new 
information  is  available.  This,  for  example,  can  be  done  by  refraining  from  rolling  over  short-term 
loans. The spillover effects of unexpected events may therefore be more substantial for bank loans 
than for securities debt. 
c) 
A well developed debt securities market provides the financial system with two legs to 
stand on 
Financial crises are normally related to the banking system. The crises have partly been the result of a 
very high concentration of risk in banks. In crisis situations, we have seen that financial institutions and 
securities markets can be complementary and prevent a credit crunch. One example is the crisis that 
followed the collapse of the US hedge fund LTCM in 1998. For a period during the crisis, there were 
substantial problems in the private bond market in the US. Financial institutions increased lending and 
prevented  a  more  extensive  credit  crunch.  Conversely,  we  have  seen  that  when  there  have  been 
problems in the banking sector, securities markets have replaced bank loans.

 Changes  are  now  taking  place,  which  I  think  will  contribute  to  strengthening  the  Norwegian  bond 
market.  Proposed  legislation  changes  will  for  example  provide  for  the  sale  of  housing  loans  to  a 
separate entity that finances the purchase by issuing bonds.  
The proposed legislative amendments would permit  a  wider range of issues in the  bond market. In 
general,  a  larger  number  of  issuers  and  investors  would  enhance  liquidity  in  the  secondary  bond 
market. This could also directly or indirectly strengthen banks’ position.

 The organisation of the pension system in Norway will also be of considerable importance to the local 
government sector as a big employer. The securities market will  also  be  influenced by the  pension 
system  Norway  will  have  in  the  future.  Life  insurance  companies  and  pension  funds  are  major 
operators in the Norwegian securities market. 
• Design of a new pension system:
- "Pay-as-you-go"
- Fund-based schemes:
– Defined contribution
– Defined benefit
• Who should bear the risk?
SG Kommunalbanken, 30.august  2002
 In  Norway,  the  bulk  of  pensions  are  funded  through  the  pay-as-you-go  system.  It  is  the  taxation  of 
current income that pays for the National Insurance Scheme’s current pension benefits. For the vast 
majority  of western countries, estimates show that substantial tax increases  will be needed to cope 
with the ageing of the population. The alternative to the pay-as-you-go system is to build up funds prior 
to the payment of pensions. These funds can consist of different assets such as stocks and bonds. 
More fund-based schemes will generate a positive stimulus to the Norwegian securities market, even if 
an appropriate risk diversification  would  imply that a  large  portion  of the capital in  pension funds  is 
8 
 BIS Review 48/2002
 invested abroad. A rising share of fund-based schemes in other countries will also increase investment 
in  Norway.  The  statutory  regulation  of  pension  fund  investment  will  also  be  of  importance.  For 
example, today most countries have relatively stringent restrictions on the equity  portion in pension 
funds’  portfolios.  However,  a  proposed  new  EU  directive  would  make  it  possible  to  increase  this 
portion, which may have an impact on demand for securities.  
Recent  developments  in  financial  markets  have  shown  that  a  substantial  measure  of  uncertainty  is 
associated  with  the  return  on  such  investments.  This  uncertainty  is  related  to  future  economic 
developments,  which  will  also  apply  to  the  pay-as-you-go  system.  It  is  true  that  Government  can 
influence this through tax changes. Adverse economic developments will, however, put the ability and 
willingness to increase taxes in order to honour pension obligations to the test. This uncertainty will be 
even  greater in a country  like Norway that is  highly reliant on one  or a small number of industries. 
Government finances are, for example, still vulnerable in the face of a sustained decline in oil prices. 
The uncertainty about future developments is continuously reflected in a fund-based system. 
An essential question associated with a fund-based system is who is to bear the risk related to returns. 
It is common to distinguish between two forms that provide different solutions for this: 
A defined-benefit pension scheme is an agreement to pay a specified benefit amount irrespective of 
the  return  on  the  premiums  paid  in.  The  benefit  can  be  adjusted  for  inflation,  wages  or  the  like. 
Premium  payments  can  be  changed  as  a  result  of  demographic  changes  such  as  higher  life 
expectancy, but not as a result of lower returns. A fall in returns must be covered by the company or 
entity  if  they  have  their  own  pension  funds.  Pensioners  are  secure  under  municipal  defined-benefit 
based pension schemes, while municipal service production must absorb the impact of lower returns.

SG Kommunalbanken, 30.august  2002
 In  recent  years,  municipalities  have  noticed  this  additional  burden  as  owners  of  the  National  Local 
Government Pension Fund. However, high returns restrained the rise in premium income towards the 
end of the 1990s. 
The alternative to a  defined-benefit pension scheme is a  defined-contribution pension scheme. The 
defined-contribution pension plan is a programme under which members decide how pension savings 
are invested. Future benefits depend on the return. It can be agreed that the pension payments are to 
be fixed. The size of payments will then depend on how much has been saved, the pension period 
and calculated return.  
Under a defined-benefit pension programme, life insurance companies and pension funds – or those 
behind them – in a sense offer insurance against a form of absolute risk to which everyone is exposed. 
Absolute  risk  may,  for  example,  be  a  change  in  economic  developments  as  a  result  of  major 
disturbances to the world economy or the domestic economy.  
Under a defined-contribution pension scheme, the individual member assumes the absolute risk.  
With a larger share of pension savings in defined-contribution schemes, some of the risk that is now 
being borne by insurance companies will be transferred to members. One problem that may arise in 
connection with defined-contribution schemes is that members end up with benefit payments that are 
BIS Review 48/2002

 markedly lower than expected. Therefore, it would also be appropriate to apply risk limits to defined-
contribution pension schemes.  
Conclusion 
The local government sector employs a rising share of workers in our country, accounting for close to 
25  per  cent  of  employment  today.  The  behaviour  of  local  government,  as  a  user  of  labour  and 
employer, is of considerable importance for economic developments and also for the inflation outlook. 
The local government sector is a major user of financial service, both as borrower and as buyer of 
insurance products. 
Norway  has  a  well-developed  financial  system,  but  its  bond  market  is  small  compared   with  other 
countries. In the long run, a larger and more liquid bond market in Norway could provide a basis for 
improved risk management and enhanced diversification of risk in the financial system. 
A new pension system is now being considered. One of the main questions relates to the distribution 
between  pay-as-you-go  and  fund-based  schemes.  There  will  always  be  a  measure  of  uncertainty 
associated  with  future  economic  developments,  and  thereby  with  future  pensions.  The  funding  of 
pensions will continuously reflect this uncertainty. Not even public pay-as-you-go schemes can guard 
us against this. A higher proportion of fund-based schemes will make this uncertainty more visible and 
provide greater opportunities for each individual to adapt. 
Thank you for your attention.
