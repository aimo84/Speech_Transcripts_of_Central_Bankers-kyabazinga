Stanley Fischer: Exchange rate systems, surveillance, and advice 
Text by Professor Stanley Fischer, Governor of the Bank of Israel, of the Mundell-Fleming 
lecture, at the Eighth Annual Jacques Polak Research Conference at the IMF, Washington 
DC, 15 November 2007. 
I  am  grateful  to  Thierry  Tressel,  Cigdem  Akin,  Meital  Gram,  Prachi  Mishra,  and  Inci  Otker-Robe  for  essential 
assistance,  and  to  Mark  Allen,  Jeff  Frankel,  Morris  Goldstein,  Ken  Rogoff,  and  Shakour  Shaalan  for  helpful 
discussions. 
 The IMF Executive Board's adoption on June 15 this year of the new Decision on Bilateral 
Surveillance  over  Members'  Policies  puts  exchange  rate  policies  at  the  center  of  the 
surveillance  process.  The  Fund's  description  of  the  new  decision  and  the  differences 
between it and the 1977 Decision notes that  
• 
"the  new  Decision  introduces  a  concept  of  external  stability  as  an  organizing 
principle  for  bilateral  surveillance",  where  external  stability  "refers  to  a  balance  of 
payments position that does not, and is not likely to, give rise to disruptive exchange 
rate movements"; 
Article IV's prohibition of exchange rate manipulation relates to policies directed at 
affecting  the  level  of  the  exchange  rate  "in  order  to  prevent  effective  balance  of 
payments  adjustment,  or  to  gain  an  unfair  competitive  advantage  over  other 
members".  A member  will be considered to be manipulating the exchange rate to 
gain  an  unfair  competitive  advantage  if  the  Fund  determines  that  the  country  is 
trying to increase net exports by promoting an undervalued exchange rate; and 
members  should  "avoid  exchange  rate  policies  that  result  in  external  instability, 
regardless of their purpose …" 
  A  little  over  a  month  earlier,  the  Board  had  discussed  the  Independent  Evaluation  Office's 
Report "IMF Exchange Rate Advice", which presented a critical view of the advice the Fund 
had offered in the period 1999-2005 on exchange rate systems, on the level of the exchange 
rate, and on the mechanics of exchange markets and of intervention. While the criticisms are 
forceful  and  in  many  cases  appear  appropriate,  they  suffer  from  the  lack  of  professional 
consensus on what the right advice should be. The IEO Evaluation Report struggles with this 
issue, but does not adequately resolve it, for example when noting (p.28): 
"…Of course, when there is little academic consensus on many points, the 
problem  of  distilling  and  establishing  operational  guidance  is  more 
challenging, but management oversight and the right internal structure are 
therefore all the more critical." 
Similarly,  in  Chapter  5  on  "Findings  and  Recommendations",  the  Report 
states (p.37): 
"68. To improve assessments of the exchange rate level, the IMF should be 
at the forefront of developing the needed analytic framework … 
The  genuine  difficulty  in  doing  this  is  no  excuse  for  not  making  more 
progress." (italics in original) 
In this lecture, I will try to draw together some lessons and questions about exchange rate 
systems, and attempt to state what is known and what is not known about them. I will also 
comment on problems of IMF surveillance. I start in Section I by revisiting the bipolar issue 
with regard to exchange rates, restating the hypothesis and updating it in light of events of 
this decade. I will argue that the bipolar view is fundamentally correct for emerging market 
and  industrialized  countries  with  open  capital  accounts  –a  qualification  that  was  stated  in 
BIS Review 141/2007

Fischer  (2001),  but  that  was  perhaps  not  adequately  stressed.  In  Section  II  I  discuss 
managed floating regimes and exchange market intervention, for countries with open capital 
accounts. Section III is devoted to the choice of exchange rate regime for countries whose 
capital account is not open; and I conclude with comments on IMF surveillance and advice. 
The bipolar hypothesis 
I.  
The bipolar hypothesis about exchange rates has come in for serious criticism. For example, 
Jeffrey  Frankel  (2004)  argues  that  there  is  no  analytic  rationale  for  the  argument  of  the 
disappearing intermediate regime. The usual justification is the impossible trinity, but Frankel 
suggests that a variety of managed floats are fully consistent with the impossible trinity – that 
one can have half-stability and half-independence. 
In my 2001 article on the bipolar exchange rate approach, I tried to clarify the hypothesis, 
and I shall have to quote extensively (Fischer, 2004, p.229): 
"… proponents of what is now known as the bipolar view – myself included 
–  probably  have  exaggerated  their  point  for  dramatic  effect.  The  right 
statement  is  that  for  countries  open  to  international  capital  flows:  (i)  soft 
exchange  rate  pegs  are  not  sustainable;  but  (ii)  a  wide  variety  of  flexible 
rate  regimes  remain  possible;  and  (iii)  it  is  to  be  expected  that  policy  in 
most countries will not be indifferent to exchange rate movements. To put 
the  point  graphically,  if  exchange  rate  arrangements  lie  along  a  line 
connecting  hard  pegs 
like  currency  unions,  currency  boards,  and 
dollarization  on  the  left,  with  free  floating  on  the  right,  the  intent  of  the 
bipolar view is not to rule out everything but the two corners, but rather to 
pronounce as unsustainable a segment of that line representing a variety of 
soft pegging exchange rate arrangements. [italics in the original] 
…  For  countries  open  to  international  capital  flows,  it  [the  bipolar  view] 
includes  as  sustainable  regimes  both  very  hard  pegs  and  a  variety  of 
floating rate arrangements, including managed floats. For countries not yet 
open  to  international  capital  flows,  it  includes  the  full  gamut  of  exchange 
rate arrangements. 
The  question  that  then  arises  is  what  exchange  rate  arrangements  are 
excluded  by  the  bipolar  view.  The  answer  is:  for  countries  open  to 
international capital flows, exchange rate systems in which the government 
is  viewed  as  being  committed  to  defending  a  particular  value  of  the 
exchange rate, or a narrow range of exchange rates, but has not made the 
institutional commitments that both constrain and enable monetary policy to 
be devoted to the sole goal of defending the parity. …" 
During  the  decade  of  the  1990s,  it  seemed  that  exchange  rate  systems  were  becoming 
bipolar  in  the  sense  defined  above,  as  can  be  seen  in  the  comparison  for  developed  and 
emerging market countries1 between the data for 1991 and 1999 in Figure 1.2 Figure 1 also 
shows  what  has  happened  since  then  for  the  group  of  developed  and  emerging  market 
countries. In brief, the shift towards bipolarity that was evident in the data for 1991-1999, has 
continued, but at a reduced pace. The major changes in the distribution between 1991 and

I  use  the  "Developed  and  emerging  market  countries"  category  as  an  approximation  to  countries  whose 
capital accounts are open, though in fact that is not true for all the countries listed as emerging (see Table 2), 
among them China. 
2   The data in this paper differ somewhat from those in Fischer (2001), because in the former the exchange rate 
regimes as of each year relate to countries that were members of the Fund in that particular year, whereas in 
this paper the data for each year are those for countries that were Fund members in 2006.

1999 were due to the introduction of the Euro and the emerging market financial crises of 
that decade. Nothing on a similar scale has happened in this decade, although the number of 
countries in EMU continues to grow, albeit slowly.  
As  a  reminder,  the  classification  of  exchange  rate  systems  used  in  Figure  1,  and  in  my 
previous  paper,  is  that  of  the  staff  of  the  IMF,  based  on  their  evaluation  of  the  de  facto 
exchange rate arrangement in place at the time.3 Table 1 lists the categories of exchange 
rate  regimes,  with  the  intermediate  grouping  consisting  of  varieties  of  less  than  very  hard 
pegs,  include  crawling  pegs  and  bands.  The  floating  category  consists  of  "managed  float" 
and "independent float", the latter less managed than the former. 
Figure 2 breaks the "Advanced and emerging market countries" grouping down into its two 
parts  –  for  advanced  (Figure  2a)  and  emerging  market  (Figure  2b)  countries  respectively. 
Among the 25 advanced countries, bipolarity is almost complete, with only Denmark, which 
shadows EMU monetary policy, in the intermediate category. Among the 39 emerging market 
countries, a considerable number still remains in the intermediate category. Tables 2a and 
2b list the advanced and emerging market countries and their exchange rate regimes. Note 
that the intermediate category for the emerging market countries includes five countries that 
are in the process of joining EMU, so that the shift to bipolarity for this country grouping is 
likely to continue in the coming years. 
It thus appears that the bipolarity view is broadly consistent with recent exchange rate regime 
developments, for the advanced and emerging market countries grouping. I should though 
emphasize  two  qualifications.  First,  the  bipolarity  hypothesis  is  about  countries  open  to 
international  capital  flows,  which  is  why  the  data  examined  in  Figures  1  and  2  are  for  the 
advanced and emerging market group – though, to be sure, some of the countries listed as 
"emerging  market"  have  significant  capital  controls.  Second,  the  "floating"  group  does  not 
consist only of freely or almost freely floating exchange rate regimes, for it includes managed 
floats:  indeed,  for  both  the  emerging  market  and  "other"  categories,  there  are  more 
"managed"  than  "independent"  floaters  among  the  countries  listed  as  having  floating 
exchange rates. ; Further even among the "independent" emerging market floaters, there are 
several countries that intervene frequently and significantly.  
The  well-known  difficult  of  classifying  exchange  rate  systems  has  led  to  a  considerable 
literature,  including  articles  by  Levy-Yeyati  and  Sturzenegger  (2000),  Reinhart  and  Rogoff 
(2004), Frankel (2004),4 Eichengreen and Razo-Garcia (2006), Tavlas, Dellas and Stockman 
(2006), and others. The fundamental issue in the classification discussion relates to how to 
classify countries whose policies appear to be different than they are declared to be by the 
country (or by someone else's classification scheme). For instance, how should one classify 
countries that declare they have a pegged exchange rate but that in practice change the peg 
frequently?  Or,  as  in  the  case  of  the  "freely  falling"  category  of  Reinhart  and  Rogoff,  how 
should one classify rates that are flexible only because extremely high inflation prevents their 
being anything other than flexible? And most important from the viewpoint of this paper, how 
                                                 
3   The approach is described in Bubula and Otker-Robe (2002). See also, IMF (2003). As of the time of writing of 
this paper, the staff of the IMF is preparing a new classification of exchange rate regimes that will make more 
use of quantitative information on exchange rate behaviors and reserves, instead of qualitative information as 
in the current de facto exchange rate classification. This new classification will change how currency unions 
are  treated,  for  example  EMU  countries  will  be  classified  as  "independently  floating".  Moreover,  a  new 
category of "tightly managed float" is being introduced. This new de facto classification, however, will not be 
retroactive,  so  there  will  be  a  break  in  the  series  in  2007.  It  is  clear  that  for  a  member  of  the  EMU,  the 
exchange rate of the currency it uses is independently floating. But it is also clear that for almost all or all EMU 
members,  the  exchange  rate  of  the  currency  they  use  is  absolutely  fixed  against  the  currencies  of  the 
countries  that  account  for  the  great  bulk  of  their  trade.  This  suggests  a  note  of  caution  about  the 
reclassification of these countries' currency regimes.  
4   Frankel (2004) notes: "Placing actual countries into … categories is far more difficult than one who has never 
tried it would guess".

should one classify heavily managed exchange rate regimes that are in principle flexible, but 
where the authorities intervene frequently and extensively?5  
While this discussion is important, I believe the essential question is whether the authorities 
are committed to defending a particular exchange rate or narrow range of exchange rates, 
for these are the unstable exchange rate regimes when the capital account is open. Further, 
while there are countries whose currencies float freely, as noted in the quote from my 2001 
paper above I do not regard intervention per se as being inconsistent with an exchange rate 
that is defined as flexible. 
The  data  presented  thus  far  relate  to  the  proposition  that  as  countries  become  more 
advanced and open their capital accounts, they also tend to leave the middle ground of soft 
pegs, and move towards either a hard peg or a floating (including managed floating) regime.6 
Another way of examining this proposition is to focus on the empirical relationship between 
countries' choice of exchange rate regime and the extent of their capital controls. The IMF 
has an index of capital controls for which the latest year is 2005.7 It is available for only 90 of 
the 186 countries for which exchange rate regime data are available.  
A probit regression was run of the exchange rate regime (coded 1 if an intermediate regime, 
0 otherwise) on the extent of capital controls, an index that runs from zero to one (e.g. Japan 
and the UK are zero, the United States is 0.2, and India is 0.95). The estimated relationship 
is  positive  but  weak,8  and  significant  only  at  the  15%  level.  On  further  examination  of  the 
data,  it  appears  that  there  might  be  a  bias  with  regard  to  the  countries  for  which  capital 
controls  data  are  available:  among  the  advanced  countries,  the  capital  controls  index  is 
available for 23 out of 25 countries; for the emerging market countries, the capital controls 
variable is available for 32 out of 39 countries; and for the "other" category (data on which 
are  presented  in  Table  3  below),  capital  controls  data  are  available  for  only  35  of  118 
countries. It is quite likely that the extent of capital controls among the countries in the "other" 
group for whom the capital controls index is not available, is significantly higher than in the 
advanced  and  emerging  market  groupings.  The  frequency  of  intermediate  regimes  is  also 
higher  in  the  "other"  group  (47.5%  versus  4%  for  advanced  countries  and  35.9%  for 
emerging market countries). 
I would like here to make two comments on the impossible trinity, in relation to Jeff Frankel's 
statement that one can have half stability and half independence of monetary policy. In the 
first  instance,  while  the  impossible  trinity  is  usually  stated  in  terms  of  an  independent 
monetary policy, it should more accurately be stated in terms of independent macroeconomic 
policy, for when a currency comes under serious pressure, typically both monetary and fiscal 
policy have to adjust if the exchange rate is to be maintained. This was, for instance, clear in 
the collapse of the Argentine currency peg. 
Second, an "independent" monetary policy in this context is one that is targeted at something 
other than the exchange rate. For many countries that have given up exchange rate pegging, 
the  monetary  regime  switches  to  inflation  targeting,  in  practice  typically  flexible  inflation 
targeting. For others, monetary policy is directed to a range of targets, including inflation and 
growth, sometimes also the real exchange rate, with tradeoffs among them to be determined 
by  the  policymakers.  Once  the  goals  of  monetary  policy  have  been  specified,  monetary 
                                                 
5   From  the  viewpoint  of  this  paper,  I  should  add  that  the  grouping  of  countries  into  "advanced",  "emerging 
market", and "other" categories is also not entirely obvious ex ante. 
6   While this is a statement about facts, I also believe – for reasons that will be explained below – that countries 
should move away from the soft center as they remove capital controls. 
7   The capital controls data are from the AREAER database. 
8   The coefficient on the capital controls variable is 0.20, implying that a one point increase in the capital controls 
variable  –  which  runs  from  zero  to  one  –  increases  the  probability  that  the  exchange  rate  regime  is 
intermediate only by 20 percent. 
4 
 BIS Review 141/2007
policy  is  no  longer  independent  of  the  factors  that  move  the  economic  variables  that  it  is 
targeting.  For  instance,  in  setting  the  policy  interest  rate,  the  Bank  of  Israel,  an  inflation 
targeter, has to take into account changes in foreign interest rates that affect the exchange 
rate and through it the inflation rate.  
Thus  in  practice  by  giving  up  exchange  rate  pegging  and  shifting  to  inflation  targeting,  a 
central  bank  does  not  gain  monetary  independence  in  the  sense  that  its  monetary  policy 
becomes independent of monetary policy – more generally of economic developments – in 
other countries. Rather it has switched from targeting one economic variable – the exchange 
rate  –  to  another,  namely  the  inflation  rate,  both  of  which  depend  to  differing  extents  on 
economic  developments  abroad  and  at  home.  This  may  be  the  meaning  of  Jeff  Frankel's 
statement that a country can have half stability and half monetary policy independence [of 
the exchange rate]. 
Why then the general recommendation to countries to avoid the intermediate regimes if they 
are  open  to  capital  movements?  Primarily  because  such  regimes  are  crisis  prone,  in  part 
because their policy dynamics are unstable: we are all familiar with the syndrome in which 
when  the  exchange  rate  is  not  under  pressure,  the  country  sees  no  need  to  change  the 
regime;  and  when  it  is  under  pressure  the  country  is  reluctant  to  change  it  because  it  is 
unclear by how much it will have to change if it is repegged, or where it will go if it is allowed 
to find its own level. As they develop and open their capital accounts, some countries, who 
have good reasons to do so – for instance those who meet the conditions for being part of an 
optimum  currency  area,  or  who  expect  to  meet  those  conditions  after  joining  the  hard 
currency  grouping  –  will  choose  to  move  towards  harder  pegs.  Others  will  move  towards 
more flexible exchange rates. As noted by Rogoff et al (2003), for advanced countries "free 
floats register faster growth than other regimes without incurring higher inflation".  
Managed floating  
II.  
As is evident from the fact that there are more managed than independent floaters among 
the floating group for the emerging market and "other" countries, very few countries, if any, 
are indifferent to the behavior of the exchange rate. For a strict inflation targeting country, the 
behavior of the exchange rate matters, but only to the extent that it affects inflation. For other 
countries the nominal exchange rate may matter because changes in the nominal rate also 
lead  to  (partially  or  wholly  temporary)  changes  in  the  real  exchange  rate  and  thus  in  net 
exports, which are targets of policy.  
Interest rate and/or fiscal policy can be used to try to affect the exchange rate; for instance 
the  Taylor  Rule  for  a  central  bank  that  is  also targeting  the  exchange  rate  can  include  an 
additional  term  in  which  the  interest  rate  responds  to  deviations  of  the  real  exchange  rate 
from  its  target  level.  Monetary  policy  effects  on  the  real  exchange  rate  are  likely  to  be 
temporary,  but  may  be  of  sufficient  duration  to  have  a  transitional  effect  on  exports  and 
imports.  More  fundamentally,  changes  in  fiscal  policy  can  be  deployed  to  affect  the  real 
exchange rate over a longer period: by tightening fiscal policy and increasing national saving, 
the government can expect to generate a real depreciation and increase net exports. 
There  is  also  the  option  of  foreign  exchange  market  intervention,  which  can  be  seen  as 
introducing an extra policy instrument to deal with an extra target of policy.9 Some countries, 
such as the United States, Chile, and Israel and more recently Japan – as well as the ECB – 
do not intervene in the exchange markets, or intervene very rarely. Even these central banks 
have  not  totally  foresworn  intervention;  rather  they  reserve  the  right  to  intervene  if  market 
conditions become disorderly, or in other extreme or emergency situations. If they intended 
                                                 
9   The  early  work  on  targets  and  instruments  suggested  the  need  for  as  many  instruments  as  targets.  In  the 
presence of uncertainty, having an extra instrument could be useful even if there were not an extra target.

never to intervene then they would presumably not hold foreign exchange reserves.10 In the 
Israeli case we have not intervened since 1997, and Chile has not intervened since 1998. 
New Zealand had not intervened since 1985, but did so in 2007. 
A policy of non-intervention is however rare among emerging market countries, even those 
with flexible rates. Among countries listed as having flexible rates in Table 2, Japan ($544 
billion),  Russia  ($263  billion),  Korea  ($136  billion),  and  India  ($125  billion)  have  each 
accumulated over $100 billion in reserves since the start of 2001 – and these numbers pale 
by comparison with the accumulation of over a trillion dollars of reserves by China during that 
period. Countries may intervene to build up their reserves, as many did after the crises of the 
1990s.  But  just  as  clearly,  and  as  is  well  known,  the  great  bulk  of  the  accumulation  of 
reserves  during  the  last  few  years  is  a  result  of  the  desire  to  prevent  exchange  rate 
appreciation. 
Ishii et al (2006) identify four circumstances under which countries intervene in the foreign 
exchange  market:11  (i)  to  correct  misalignments  or  to  stabilize  the  exchange  rate  at  a 
predetermined level – in other words, to try to set the exchange rate at a desired level, e.g. 
one which will encourage exports; (ii) to calm disorderly markets; (iii) to accumulate reserves; 
and (iv) to supply foreign exchange to the market – this occurs when the government is a 
major  recipient  of  foreign  exchange  (e.g.  through  royalty  payments  for  mineral  extraction), 
and will not be discussed further.12
With regard to (ii), the stabilization of disorderly markets: in extremis, the central bank may 
have  to  intervene  to  stabilize  a  disorderly  market,  but  it  needs  to  be  aware  that  the  more 
frequently and easily it intervenes, the more it will impede the development of a deep and 
robust market, in which it is possible to hedge against exchange rate changes without having 
to rely on government intervention.13 With regard to (iii), the accumulation of reserves, the 
question  is  how  best  to  do  this.  A  variety  of  approaches  has  been  used,  including  buying 
preannounced amounts of foreign exchange at a steady rate over a period of months. Other 
central banks have added to reserves on an opportunistic basis.  
Case (i) is most significant from the viewpoint of the new Decision on Bilateral Surveillance, 
for  it  relates  to  exchange  rate  manipulation.  Why  might  such  intervention  work?  Here  the 
authors identify three channels: (i) a signaling channel – where the signal is one about future 
monetary  policy  or  more  generally  the  authorities'  preferences  about  the  desired  range  of 
values of the exchange rate; (ii) a portfolio balance channel – where the central bank is a 
sufficiently large player in the foreign exchange market to affect the exchange rate; and (iii) a 
microstructure  channel  –  where  the  central  bank  has  sufficient  information  about  the 
                                                 
10   A few years ago the Reserve Bank of New Zealand considered whether to stop holding reserves. This would 
have  sent  a  powerful  though  not  totally  convincing  signal  that  there  would  be  no  intervention,  because 
intervention can also be financed by borrowing. 
11   Included in Ishii et al (2006) is material on the mechanics of foreign exchange intervention, which can be seen 
as providing a partial answer to the IEO's concerns that Fund staff are not equipped to give practical advice on 
intervention  and  other  practical  exchange  rate  issues,  including  how  to  develop  the  needed  market 
infrastructure. In any case, it is not entirely clear that the staff should be experts in the nitty-gritty of exchange 
rate  intervention,  which  is  highly  country  and  institution  dependent.  It  is probably  better  in  this  area  for  the 
Fund to help the central bank of the concerned country to obtain technical assistance from a central bank that 
is or has been in a similar situation. This was attempted in the Indonesian program in 1997, but it became 
clear there that the forces moving the exchange rate were too powerful to be stemmed by intervention alone, 
however sophisticated it might be. 
12   I  have  avoided  using  the  Calvo-Reinhart  term  "fear  of  floating",  preferring  rather  to  try  to  explain  why 
countries often intervene. 
13   Ishii  et  al  (2006)  describe  the  approach  of  the  Mexican  authorities,  which  involved  selling  options  to  sell 
foreign exchange if the exchange rate depreciated to a specified value. This approach may have encouraged 
the development of hedging instruments by the private sector.

operation of the market and the forces active in it to be able to intervene in particular ways or 
at a particular time such that it can move the rate.  
In the face of significant capital flows, these channels are unlikely to be able to influence the 
rate for very long without supportive macroeconomic policy. That is why it has been so hard 
to find major effects of intervention per se on the exchange rates of the major industrialized 
countries.  However,  where  capital  flows  are  controlled  or  the  country  is  not  yet  well 
integrated into the global capital markets, and provided policymakers are willing to intervene 
on a sufficiently large scale, the portfolio balance channel can operate to enable the country 
to  have  a  sustained  effect  on  the  exchange  rate,  as  the  Chinese  and  the  Russian  cases 
illustrate. 
Interventions are not costless. Unless they are sterilized they are likely to have an inflationary 
effect, and as they become larger, they become harder to sterilize. If domestic interest rates 
are higher than those abroad, monetary sterilization is expensive for the central bank; and if 
in  any  case  the  exchange  rate  will  eventually  have  to  appreciate  against  the  currency  in 
which the reserves are held, there will also be potentially large capital losses on the reserves 
on  that  account.  Clearly  though,  some  countries  regard  the  growth-  and  export-promoting 
effects  of  such  actions  as  worth  the  cost,  for  the  cost  issues  are  well  understood  by  the 
countries accumulating reserves on a massive scale.  
In  cases  where  the  export  proceeds  accrue  to  the  government,  they  can  be  sterilized  by 
being  reinvested  abroad  through  a  sterilization  fund.  They  can  also  be  sterilized  through 
running  a  larger  fiscal  surplus,  and  building  up  a  stabilization  fund  that  may  also  invest 
abroad.  Russia  has  used  exchange  market  intervention  and  fiscal  policy  in  the  form  of 
building up a stabilization fund, but nonetheless is paying a price for its sterilization in terms 
of inflation that is above the desired level. 
Why despite the many reasons central banks may want to intervene in the foreign exchange 
markets do some central banks do their best not to intervene? In the case of Israel, where 
there are essentially no capital controls, the non-intervention policy is based on the view that 
intervention is unlikely to have a sustained effect on the exchange rate, and that monetary 
policy decisions are more fundamental. Further, we believe that the foreign exchange market 
works better when market participants do not expect the central bank to intervene except in 
extreme circumstances, and thus have to focus in their decisions on the underlying forces 
that determine the exchange rate.  
The passthrough from the exchange rate to prices is large and rapid in Israel – close to 0.3 
within  a  quarter  –  and  exchange  rate  movements  are  therefore  taken  into  account  in 
predicting  inflation  and  the  effects  of  interest  rate  decisions  on  prices.  But  this  connection 
has  not  led  us  to  want  to  intervene  in  the  foreign  exchange  market,  a  decision  that  we 
believe – in IMF language – has served the economy well.  
Other countries 
III.  
Turning to countries other than those defined as developed or emerging market countries, 
Figure 3 shows that while the evolution of exchange rate regimes between 1991 and 1999 
was consistent with the bipolar hypothesis, the evolution of exchange rate regimes for this 
group  of  countries  since  1999  is  not.  Rather  on  balance  there  has  been  a  move  from  the 
floating rate to the intermediate regimes.  
There  has  been  a  considerable  amount  of  movement  among  exchange  rate  regimes  in 
Figure 3. Fifteen countries moved into the intermediate regime from the floating regime and 
six moved from the intermediate regime to floating. El Salvador moved from an intermediate 
regime to dollarization. Table 3 lists the countries in this group along with their exchange rate 
regimes;  asterisks  indicate  changes  in  the  exchange  rate  regime  (including  shifts  among 
subcategories  within  the  three  major  categories)  between  1999  and  2006,  with  asterisked 
BIS Review 141/2007 
 7
numbers in brackets indicating the number of countries in each of the seven categories in the 
table that were not in that category in 1999. 
The  economics  literature  has  not yet  developed  a  strong  position  on  which  exchange  rate 
system developing countries should adopt. Frankel (1999 and 2004) and Mussa et al (2000) 
emphasize  that  "no  single  currency  regime  is  right  for  all  countries  or  at  all  times". 
Nonetheless, Rogoff et al (2003) summarize their review of the evidence of the impact of the 
exchange rate regime on developing countries' economic performance thus: "relatively rigid 
regimes – pegs and intermediate flexibility arrangements – appear to have enhanced policy 
credibility  and  thus  helped  achieve  lower  inflation  at  little  apparent  cost  in  terms  of  lost 
growth, higher growth volatility, or more frequent crises."  
Mussa et al (2000) provide a list of factors that would favor a country pegging its rate: (i) low 
capital  mobility;  (ii)  a  high  share  of  trade  with  the  country  to  which  it  is  pegged;  (iii)  the 
shocks it faces are similar to those facing the country to which it pegs; (iv) it already relies 
extensively on its partners' currency; (v) fiscal policy is flexible and sustainable; (vi) its labor 
markets are flexible; (vii) it has high international reserves.  
In other words, to sustain a pegged rate a developing economy should have the capacity to 
perform well and flexibly, and maintain low inflation. Otherwise it would be advised to adopt a 
floating exchange rate regime, thereby allowing the exchange rate to act as an extra shock 
absorber. Of course, the requirements listed by Mussa et al are also those that, together with 
a  strong  financial  system,  would  enable  the  country  successfully  to  maintain  a  flexible 
exchange rate system. Mussa et al also note that as countries develop and become more 
financially sophisticated and more integrated into global markets, they should consider more 
flexible exchange rate regimes. 
This  is  far  from  a  detailed  manual  or  formula  that  tells  each  country  what  exchange  rate 
system to adopt. Indeed, if the Fund were to develop a detailed manual it would be accused 
of  having  a  cookie  cutter  approach  to  the  issue.  It  is  not  surprising  that  there  is  no  such 
manual, for there is no way of specifying the right exchange rate system for a country without 
a  careful  analysis  of  its  circumstances  –  and  there  is  no  question  that  among  those 
circumstances is its exchange rate regime history. "If it ain't broke – or likely to break soon, or 
being held together only with the help of economically distortionary and costly measures – 
don't fix it" is good advice in this area too. 
The general presumption then is that as countries become more developed, they should be 
moving away from intermediate regimes, towards greater flexibility of the exchange rate – or 
in some cases towards a hard peg.  
Exchange rate surveillance and advice 
IV. 
To return now to the new Decision on Bilateral Surveillance, the quotes with which this paper 
opens  raise  two  questions.  First,  there  seems  to  be  a  tension  between  the  focus  on  an 
unsustainable balance of payments position, and that on exchange rate manipulation, which 
relates to an undervalued exchange rate. From the viewpoint of what types of situation might 
give rise to disruptive exchange rate movements, a currency that is overvalued, or a balance 
of payments deficit that is so large as to be unsustainable, can give rise to rapid exchange 
rate movements. One example is the current account deficit of the United States in recent 
years.  There  was  no  exchange  rate  manipulation;  nonetheless  by  most  measures  the 
currency was overvalued. Possibly the overvaluation could be offset – though not fully, so 
long as other countries maintained their dollar pegs – through fiscal policy, thereby reducing 
the underlying threat to stability of the global exchange rate system. Which takes us to the 
second  question:  why  does  the  decision  relate  to  "exchange  rate  policies  that  result  in 
external instability, regardless of their purpose …" (underlining added) rather than to "policies 
that result in external instability, regardless of their purpose"? 
8 
 BIS Review 141/2007
The failure to use fiscal policy to deal with an unsustainable current account deficit would be 
as deserving of staff and Board censure as would policies – such as sustained intervention – 
to  manipulate  the  exchange  rate  to  increase  net  exports.  Presumably  the  emphasis  on 
exchange rate policies was included to deal with the difficulty that if other countries peg to 
the dollar, then a significant part of the normal adjustment mechanism is neutralized – and 
that  the  pegging  decision  was  not  that  of  the  United  States.  That  is  understandable,  but 
should  not  have  led  to  what  appears  to  be  a  too  narrow  focus  on  exchange  rate  policies 
rather than overall economic policy. 
As a central banker from a small economy, I am also concerned that the new decision may 
focus too narrowly on external stability. For many countries, the Article IV report is the most 
thorough  and  professional  evaluation  of  the  country's  economy  and  economic  policies.  As 
such,  it  provides  a  valuable  service  for  the  smaller  members  of  the  Fund.  I  hope  the  new 
decision  does  not  significantly  reduce  the  scope  and  depth  of  Article  IV  reports  for  such 
countries. 
There  has  been  a  great  deal  of  criticism  of  the  Fund  for  failing  to  censure  the  Chinese 
authorities more seriously over their exchange rate policies and huge and growing current 
account  surplus.  There  are  two  questions  to  answer  here.  First,  why  are  the  Chinese 
pursuing  these  policies?  The  answer  is  that  the  undervaluation  and  export  promotion 
strategy has been a highly successful growth strategy, not only for China but also for other 
countries. The policy works, spectacularly so in the case of China.  
Second, why have the world's entreaties and pressures – bilateral from the United States, in 
European-Chinese  meetings,  and  via  the  Fund's  surveillance  –  to  revalue  not  had  a 
substantial impact on Chinese policies? Presumably for the same reason, that the present 
policies have worked spectacularly, for China.  
The standard analysis of the costs and dangers to China and to the world economy of its 
massive rate of reserve accumulation is correct. So what should the Fund – newly equipped 
with the new decision on surveillance – be doing with its analysis? Mussa (2007) asserts that 
the  Fund's  management  should  have  taken  an  increasingly  tough  stand,  mentioning  "the 
possibility of formal censure of a country's policies by the Executive Board as a final resort 
for  those  rare  and  highly  regrettable  cases  where  all  vigorous  but  less  extreme  efforts  at 
persuasion have failed".  
There is no question that the Fund staff should state its professional judgment clearly and 
unambiguously in all surveillance reports. There is also no question that in contacts with the 
authorities,  the  staff  should  be  explaining  its  professional  judgments  and  giving  its  advice 
more frankly than is possible in written reports. I am sure that at present, as in the past, very 
frank  but  confidential  policy  discussions  take  place  at  all  levels  with  the  authorities  of 
member countries. I also believe that these discussions have an impact. But of course, the 
Fund's capacity to influence a member's policies is greater in the context of a program than 
in the context of consultations.  
One of my mentors once asked me: "Who do you listen to, your friends or your enemies?" 
The answer is that it is easier to accept advice from friends, whom you believe support your 
objectives. But it is also necessary to listen to your enemies – sometimes they are right. Thus 
the Fund should be working very hard to gain the trust of its member countries (something 
that a cooperative organization should be doing in any case), should state its views firmly at 
all  times,  should  press  for  policy  changes  that  it  believes  are  important  through  every 
effective channel, and reserve for very rare occasions a decision to enter into open conflict 
with a member.  
A final word – or rather two final stories – about advice. I was struck by the emphasis the IEO 
report  on  IMF  exchange  rate  advice  put  on  country's  responses  to  questions  about  the 
quality of the advice they receive from the Fund. The mentor mentioned above used to say 
when  asked  for  advice "Tell  me  what  advice  you  would  like  me  to  give  you."  And  I  fondly 
remember an aunt who lived in a small town in Zambia who twice a year used to visit my 
BIS Review 141/2007 
 9
parents  in  the  bigger  town  in  Zimbabwe  in  which  we  lived.  She  had  a  significant  weight 
problem. Before each visit she would ask my parents to arrange for her to see a doctor. They 
would ask whether she would like to see the same doctor as last time. She gave the same 
answer each time: "No, I need a different doctor, that doctor was no good, he told me to eat 
less."  
Sometimes advice is valued less for its quality and more for its agreeableness, and that is 
simply a fact of life with which the Fund has to contend.
