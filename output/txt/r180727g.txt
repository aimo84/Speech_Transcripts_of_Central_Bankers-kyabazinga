THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM CHALLENGES FOR MONETARY POLICY AND THE 
IMF-SNB 8TH HIGH-LEVEL CONFERENCE ON 
GLOBAL SAFETY NET IN AN EVOLVING GLOBAL ECONOMY 
Baur au Lac, Zurich, Switzerland, May 8th, 2018 
Remarks by Mario Marcel, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile∗ 
  PANEL I: Challenges for Monetary Policy from Global Financial Cycles 
 
I  would  like  to  thank  the  organizers  for  the  opportunity  to  discuss  the  evolving  relationship 
between Global Financial Cycles and monetary policy at the national level. This is a topic especially 
important  to  emerging  market  economies  (EMEs)  like  mine,  for  which  economic  and  financial 
openness went  hand  in  hand  with  strengthening  its  macroeconomic  policy  framework  over  the 
last 30 years. 
 
Such  external  openness  leads  analysts  to  frequently  rank  my  country  very  high  in  terms  of 
exposure  to  international  trade  and  financial  shocks,  only  to  see  such  shocks  having  a  milder 
impact on the economy when they happen. While we believe that such gap is to a large extent due 
to  our  appropriate  monetary  and  fiscal  policies  and  the  institutions  supporting  them,  we  are 
aware  that  this  does  not  mean  full  insulation  from  global  developments,  including,  of  course, 
Global Financial Cycles. 
 
Structural  differences  between  advanced  economies  (AEs)  and  EMEs  may  be  relevant  to  the 
nature and impact of Global Financial Cycles 
 
EMEs tend to depend more on foreign financing, due to lower domestic saving capacity. At the 
same time, EMEs usually have shallower domestic capital markets. These two factors make EMEs 
particularly  vulnerable  to  changes  in  international  capital  flows.  Weaker  institutional  and 
regulatory  frameworks  have  added  up  to  make  these  economies  historically  associated  with 
increased  cyclical  vulnerabilities.  The  procyclicality  of  bank  credit  and  debt-driven  fiscal 
expansions, together with more rigid exchange rate regimes, contributed in the past to amplify 
external shocks, making exposure to changes in external financial conditions a relevant driver of 
overall economic activity. 
 
Because of these vulnerabilities, EMEs are often considered a risky-asset class. As such, investment 
flows pour into them when global conditions improve and risk-on is the mood in the market—be it 
through international banking linkages or direct portfolio flows. Domestic asset prices surge more 
vigorously  in  response  to  these  flows  due  to  limited  financial  market  depth,  strengthening  the 
market value of firms’ collateral and further contributing to the buildup of vulnerabilities. 
 
Two  factors  have  been  especially  critical  in  the  past.  First,  the  so  called  “original  sin”,  whereby 
EMEs—especially governments—fund themselves in foreign currency, creating foreign exchange 
(FX) mismatches in balance sheets of the government, banks, or corporations. Second, procyclical 
fiscal and monetary policies that amplify external shocks. In such cases, even a mild external shock 
can push economies to the brink of recession.

Medel.

In short, domestic weaknesses interact with global financial attitudes in a dangerous mix that has 
historically proven to be highly destabilizing for EMEs, compared to AEs. 
 
Still, this characterization is based on very crude generalizations; in reality, EMEs spread over a 
broad range of possibilities for each dimension and different combinations of them. The question 
is then to what extent does such variety of cases make a difference for the spillover from changes 
in global financial conditions and what role does the exchange rate (ER) play in it. 
 
How important are global financial and business cycles to EMEs compared to local ones? 
 
To address this issue from an EME’s perspective, a first question refers to the relative importance 
of  externally-induced  shocks  as compared  to  purely domestic  ones.  Even  if  the  Global  Financial 
Cycle  were  a  very  powerful  force,  as  long  as  countries  can  still  get  into  troubles  of  their  own, 
macro policy, including the ER regime, may make an important difference. 
 
A  review  of  the  last  40  years  of  economic  history  reveals  many  episodes  during  which  cyclical 
turning points originated in domestic, rather than foreign, shocks. In Latin America in particular, 
many  of  the  major shocks  of the 1980s, 1990s,  and  early  2000s originated  locally,  usually  from 
misconceived policies, private sector exuberance, or inadequate regulations. The fact that these 
shocks showed up as large current account deficits surely reflects the degree of dependence of 
governments and business on external funding, but that does not exempt local conditions from 
being the main source of the imbalances. 
 
In particular, a classical Latin American and Caribbean countries (LAC) crisis would show up as an 
unsustainable disequilibrium between public, private, or foreign savings and investment partially 
contained by some form of FX control, which turns into a major economic and financial crisis once 
the currency devaluates. Abundant foreign capital may help prolong the situation for a while, but 
only to make the inevitable turnaround more damaging. 
 
It is important to underscore the role of domestic ER policies. During the upswing, central banks in 
EMEs  often  try  to  curb  the  resulting  appreciation,  either  through  outright  currency  fixation  of 
heavy FX market intervention. As a number of recent papers have found, these policies tend to 
reinforce  capital  flows.1  When  the  tide  turns,  however,  these  rigid  ER  regimes  are  often 
accompanied by large devaluations, which contribute substantially to insolvency problems in both 
real and financial domestic sectors. 
 
Global financial conditions may thus influence the timing or even the intensity of a domestically-
induced  crisis,  but  they  cannot  suppress  it  altogether.  Moreover,  such  favorable  financial 
conditions usually hit back with a vengeance once local weaknesses reveal themselves. From here 
we can conclude that appropriate macro policies are necessary to prevent locally-induced cycles, 
even when powerful global financial forces are at play. 
 
The transmission of Global Financial Cycles to EMEs and the role of ER regimes

Exchange  Rate  Regime:  A  Perspective  from  Emerging  Markets,”  Discussion  Paper  #12696,  Centre  for 
Economic Policy Research.

Again, due to their risky nature, EMEs are often perceived as a risky-asset class. As such, capital 
flows into/out of these economies tend to follow risk-on/risk-off patterns of the Global Financial 
Cycle, in turn strongly linked to the Global Business Cycle. 
 
The  ER  regime  plays  an  important  role  in  the  transmission  of  financial  spillovers.  When  capital 
flows into EMEs—for instance, as a result of a perceived softening of international monetary policy 
(MP) conditions—, the resulting appreciation of domestic currencies is the first line of response 
that  discourages  further  flows  (as  a  contemporaneous  appreciation  increases  the  expected 
depreciation in the medium term). But, if the FX adjustment is neutralized by FX interventions by 
the domestic monetary authority, it will further encourage inflows by reducing ER risk for foreign 
investors. As a result, FX stabilization enhances the spillovers from foreign conditions on broader 
metrics of domestic financing conditions, including credit expansion and stock market prices, as 
well as local bond markets.

Recent research conducted at the Central Bank of Chile highlights this point. Figure 1 shows the 
impact of US MP shocks (changes in US short-term rates around Federal Reserve meetings) on ER 
and long-term bond prices in Chile (with clean floating) and Mexico, which has actively intervened 
in recent years. The figure illustrates this pattern, showing a significant response of the Chilean 
 3 
peso  but  a  non-significant  movement  in  long-term  bond  prices.  The  opposite  results  hold  for 
Mexico.2 
 
Similarly, the response at country-group level also indicates differences when an US MP shock hits 
other  countries' MP  rate decomposed  into expected  MP  rate  and  term  premium  (see  Table  1). 
Whereas in AEs the adjustment mechanism is mainly through expected MP rate, the transmission 
in  EMEs  is  via  the  term  premium.  ER  comes  out  as  more  reactive  in  AEs  rather  than  EMEs, 
presumably because central banks in EMEs are less prone to conduct sterilized FX interventions, 
aiming to—partially—stabilize interest rates and the ER simultaneously.

Of course, a flexible ER also facilitates the reallocation of economic activity between the tradable 
and  non-tradable  sectors  by  speeding  up  the  adjustment  of  relative  prices.  This  makes  the 
connection  between  financial  flows  and  economic  activity  operate  through  changes  in  the 
composition of demand and output, rather than “internal devaluations” which became especially 
fruitful for several Eurozone and EME countries in the past decade. 
 
The role of commodity prices 
 
Some EMEs, in particular those with large commodity sectors, may at certain episodes display a 
decoupling of capital flows from global financing conditions. This seems to have been the case in 
the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, in which the general risk-off attitude contrasted with 
the relative strength of commodity exporters due to China’s contribution to global growth. Indeed, 
the quick recovery in energy, food, and metal commodities beginning in 2010 led to a surge in 
growth  and  capital  inflows  to  commodity-exporting  EMEs  that  starkly  contrasted  with  the 
depressed macroeconomic conditions that characterized the slow recovery of AEs. 
 
It is tempting to link the decoupling of economic and financial conditions of the 2010-13 episode 
as a sign that EMEs were beginning to overcome some of their past institutional weaknesses and 
policy  mistakes.  But  the  events  triggered  by  the  taper  tantrum  episode  recommend  taking  this 
interpretation with a grain of salt. Indeed, such events mark a clear reversal in the outlook of EMEs 
and  the  direction  of  external  financing  to  these  economies,  once  again  following  closely  the 
downward trend of global commodity prices.

Commodity cycles may be linked to global business and financial cycles at critical junctures, but 
commodity long cycles are more related to technological progress, changes in the composition of 
demand, and global trade patterns (see Figure 2).

The experience of Chile since 2000 
 
Chile has been traditionally exposed to global cycles, speeded-up growth in the mid-1980s, once a 
major  financial  crisis  led  to  a  major  upgrade  in  financial  regulations.  This  bonanza  period  was 
halted by the Asian Crisis in mid-1997. The Central Bank tried to sustain the Chilean currency, by 
then under crawling bands, in the middle of a substantial external shock. This led the Central Bank 
to  raise  the  interest  rate  to  14%,  by  then  a  real  interest  rate.  Thus,  the  financial  system  face 
overnight rates of nearly 100%. The Chilean economy enters into a recession in late 1998. 
 
Floating  ER  was  added  to  forward-looking  inflation  targeting,  and  then  complemented  by  a 
Structural Balance-based fiscal policy in the early 2000s. Since then, the Chilean economy has been 
able  to  cushion  external  shocks  pretty  successfully,  with  wide  fluctuations  in  the  ER.  FX 
interventions have not been ruled out but done only four times in 18 years. 
 
During the Global Financial Crisis, financial institutions faced liquidity constraints, especially from 
local subsidiaries of international banks, which were resolved by extraordinary liquidity injections 
by the Central Bank and a major fiscal impulse. 
 
The end of the commodity bonanza translated into currency devaluation, but the economy only 
slowed down rather than entering a recession and growth is now recovering very rapidly. 
 
Above  all,  macro  policy  has  been  successful  in  cushioning  external  shocks,  so  now  they  have  a 
milder impact compared to past episodes. 
 
In  perspective,  Chilean  MP  today  is  among  the  most  expansionary  of  a  group  of  comparable 
countries (Figure 3). This persistent expansionary monetary impulse is also observed in consumer, 
 5 
commercial,  and  mortgage  interest  rates,  which  are  all  at  or  very  near  their  all-time  lows. 
Moreover, different qualitative measures produced by the Central Bank of Chile coincide in their 
favorable evaluation of the cost of credit, considering its low interest rate. 
 
In addition, in recent years it has maintained a remarkable degree of independence from the US 
MP, especially after the Great Financial Crisis (see Figure 4).

Some  key  factors  supporting  the  roles  of  ER  as  a  shock  absorber  of  financial  and  commodity 
price shocks 
 
A flexible ER regime is not a form of snake oil to alleviate any sort of global ailment. ER volatility 
can,  of  course,  generate  major  wealth  shifts,  and  even  solvency  problems  to  agents  with  large 
balance  sheet  mismatches—including  government.  They  can 
in 
competitiveness,  which  may  harm  overall  activity  if  winners  fail  to  capture  benefits  as  fast  as 
induce  major 
losses 
 6 
losers realize costs. Constituencies around fixed prices—including the ER—are very concentrated 
and powerful. Hence, a flexible ER needs to be appropriately articulated with other components 
on the macro policy framework. 
 
First  of  all,  it  is  important  to  minimize  financial  exposure  to  ER  risk.  This  involves  curtailing 
currency  mismatches  in  government,  business,  and  bank  balance  sheets  through  regulation 
(macroprudential?) and the use of market hedging mechanisms, like FX derivatives. 
 
Second, a deep and stable domestic long-term capital market is essential for containing the impact 
of  external  financial  shocks  on  the  flow  of  credit.  Some  countries  resolve  this  through  a  high 
propensity  to  save  of  the  population;  others  may  need  to  force  savings  through  pension  and 
insurance schemes. A large pool of domestic savings may need to be partly invested abroad to 
secure  appropriate  returns.  In  such  case,  a  natural  hedge  may  develop  between  institutional 
investors and other players which may facilitate the development of ER derivatives. 
 
Market products for ER hedging may also help mitigate the effect of ER fluctuation on tradables. 
This may be a cheaper source of insurance than the imperfect ER insurance provided by fixed-rate 
or managed regimes. 
 
A flexible ER regime also requires overcoming the fear of floating of monetary authorities. This is 
especially  important  given  the  pass-through  of  ER  into  domestic  inflation.  In  particular,  this 
requires a strong discipline in applying inflation targeting in a forward-looking mode, so as to filter 
short-term ER-induced fluctuations. Even with forward-looking inflation targeting, the central bank 
may need not only tolerate significant deviations of current inflation from the medium-term target 
but also to exercise a lot of judgment in assessing when deviations in expected inflation originated 
in the ER justify a change in the policy stance. 
 
Tolerance  to  ER-induced  deviations  in  inflation  is  easier  the  higher  the  credibility  of  monetary 
policy.  If  medium-term  inflation  expectations  remain  anchored  at  the  policy  target  level,  the 
central bank can count on economic agents to help convergence afterwards. Building a record of 
credibility  and  reputation  has  been  a  product  of  a  coordinated,  persistent,  and  long-term 
commitment by the Central Bank of Chile to the best practices on transparency and independence. 
 
A responsible and countercyclical fiscal stance is an absolute requirement for consistency of the 
overall macroeconomic framework. Besides from softening cyclical fluctuations, fiscal credibility is 
an important ingredient of MP credibility, as it alleviates potential concerns of fiscal dominance 
behind MP decisions. 
 
Finally, all of the above may need to rely on substantial financial buffers, like moderate levels of 
indebtedness  by  all  major  economic  agents;  safe  financial  assets  (sovereign  wealth  funds);  well 
capitalized banks, and so on. 
 
So, building a reliable floating ER regime able to cushion the domestic economy from financial and 
commodity shocks takes much more than courage and a statutory decision. It should be supported 
by a sophisticated financial and institutional architecture. This is not easy to capture in attribute-
based scoring systems. 
 
 7 
But, when this architecture is put in place and preserved over time, the floating ER regime may be 
just  the  expression  of  a  broader  arrangement  of  institutions  and  policies.  Perhaps  it  is  such 
arrangement, rather than the ER policy itself, the factor that may really protect EMEs from major 
global shocks, but this is not material to the end result: substantial smoothing of external volatility 
over the local economy. 
 
Finally,  a  greater  convergence  to  the  international  standards  on  banking  capital  requirements 
defined by Basel III, especially for global banks, is among the macroprudential policies currently 
promoted to reduce the impacts of greater external volatility. 
 
Thank you.
