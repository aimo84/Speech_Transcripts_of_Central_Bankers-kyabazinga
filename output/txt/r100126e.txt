Subir Gokarn: Financial development and deposit insurance – some 
linkages 
Remarks  by  Dr  Subir  Gokarn,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  and 
Chairperson, Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), at the 8th Asian 
Regional  Committee  and  International  Conference  of  International  Associations,  Goa, 
18 January 2010. 
 Introduction 
Governor, Reserve Bank of India, Dr. D. Subbarao; Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India, 
Ms.  Usha  Thorat;  President,  IADI  and  Vice-Chairman,  FDIC,  Mr.  Martin  Gruenberg; 
Chairman,  ARC  and  Deputy  Governor,  DICJ,  Mr.  Mutsuo  Hatano;  CEO  of  the  Deposit 
Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation, Mr. H. N. Prasad; Distinguished Participants;  
Let me add my own words of welcome to all the participants in this very important event. In 
his  opening  address,  Governor  Subbarao  provided  a  historical  perspective  on  the 
development  of  deposit  insurance  in  India,  highlighted  its  importance  in  sustaining 
confidence in the banking system as we dealt with the global financial crisis and laid out the 
challenges that it will have to deal with in the future. I would obviously not like to cover the 
same ground. Also, I must admit to being a complete novice as far as deposit insurance is 
concerned,  having  only  taken  on  the  role  of  Chairperson  of  Deposit  Insurance  and  Credit 
Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) in late November 2009, when I joined the Reserve Bank of 
India as Deputy Governor. Consequently, I thought it would be more appropriate and useful 
for me to talk about a broad vision for financial sector development, which will then provide a 
framework within which to view the evolving role of deposit insurance. 
The  recent  crisis  is  clearly  a  dominant  factor  in  any  current  discussion  on  financial  sector 
development.  While  this  is  entirely  understandable  and  legitimate,  we  must  resist  the 
temptation to view the future entirely through the lens of the crisis. Crises will come and go, 
but the role that the financial sector as a whole plays in economic development and welfare 
will be fulfilled only if we allow it to find a healthy balance between multiple and sometimes 
potentially conflicting objectives. Taken together, these objectives provide an enduring way 
to  view  financial  sector  development,  which  combines  both  traditional  functions  and 
incorporates  new  goals  that  are  driven  by  both  domestic  and  global  aspirations  and 
compulsions. 
A framework for financial development 
I  will  now  lay  out  a  framework  for  financial  sector  development,  which  encompasses  five 
critical objectives. These five objectives are: Efficiency, Stability, Transparency, Inclusion and 
Sustainability. 
Efficiency  
No one would seriously question the premise that a financial system, whatever its structure 
might be, will best serve development and welfare objectives by producing its services at as 
low a cost as possible. Like in any productive activity, achieving this objective depends on 
three broad factors: the cost of raising funds, the costs of due diligence and risk mitigation 
associated  with  deploying  these  funds  and  the  cost  of  intermediation,  which  depends 
significantly on competition, organizational structure and the deployment of technology. The 
policy  and  regulatory  imperatives  on  this  front  should  be  to  ensure  that  financial  service 
providers have the ability to carry out their resource mobilization and deployment activities in 
BIS Review 6/2010

a  competitive  environment,  in  which  individual  providers  have  the  flexibility  to  organize 
themselves  in  the  most  cost-effective  manner.  However,  this  is  as  far  as  the  analogy  with 
other  productive  activities  goes.  As  we  all  know  and  was  vividly  demonstrated  during  the 
crisis,  financial  services  are  in  many  significant  ways  a  unique  specimen,  which  requires 
special consideration. This brings me to the next objective. 
financial  service  providers  put  aside  adequate  resources 
Stability 
We  could  also  term  this  objective  “prudence”,  but  I  believe  that  stability,  while  fully 
encompassing prudence, is a somewhat broader concept. The foundation of this objective is, 
of  course,  risk.  Financial  services,  however  defined,  are  essentially  risky  in  nature.  There 
would be little value added by financial intermediaries if they did not find ways of taking on 
risks and earning the rewards that go with them. However, the license to take risks cannot be 
unbounded;  the  consequences  of  risks  materializing  can  be  severe  for  both  direct 
stakeholders  and,  significantly,  innocent  bystanders.  A  prudential  approach  ensures  that 
individual 
to  avoid  such 
consequences.  A  wider  approach  to  stability  is  based  on  the  notion  that  the  system  as  a 
whole  has  the  capacity  to  deal  with  widespread  pressures  that  emanate  from  the  multiple 
linkages and inter-dependencies within the system and are beyond the prudential capacity of 
individual providers to handle.  
The recent crisis and ones preceding it have clearly shown that the stability of the financial 
system is a significant contributor to macroeconomic management. It has, of course, been 
difficult to translate this into a widely accepted policy framework, because so many potential 
instruments of stability are in direct and obvious conflict with the other four objectives that I 
referred  to.  But,  clearly,  however  efficient  and  dynamic  it  may  be,  an  unstable  financial 
system can seriously undermine the performance of the real economy and a viable way to 
resolve these conflicts needs to be found. 
Transparency 
An  important  lesson  from  the  crisis  was  “what  cannot  be  measured  cannot  be  managed”. 
Diagnoses  of  the  causes  of  the  crisis  generally  suggest  that  neither  regulators  nor  top 
managements  of  large,  global  financial  institutions  had  a  complete  picture  of  the  product 
offerings and portfolio choices that ultimately led to the catastrophe. Of course, transparency 
has always been a central pillar of financial regulation, but clearly, the conventional notion 
simply  did  not  address  many  new  developments  in  financial  activity.  Global  initiatives  to 
achieve  some  degree  of  regulatory  co-ordination  in  the  wake  of  the  crisis  emphasize  the 
need for a greater degree of harmonization of disclosure standards across countries to keep 
pace with the geographic spread and diversification of financial service providers. The need 
for strengthening this attribute of the global financial system may have been highlighted by 
the crisis, but there is little question that it would have manifested itself sooner rather than 
later.  
Inclusion 
This objective is particularly significant in the current Indian context. It is a central theme of 
the RBI’s observance of the institution's Platinum Jubilee (or 75th Anniversary). But, I would 
argue that inclusion is an important component of any financial system and its pursuit is a 
legitimate objective for policymakers and regulators under any circumstances. The specific 
strategies will, of course, depend on the context and state of development of each country. In 
its early stages, as exemplified by the Indian situation, the challenge is simply to give millions 
of  people  their  first  access  to  very  basic  financial  services  at  extremely  low  thresholds  of 
activity.

 BIS Review 6/2010
Sustainability 
As global attention on climate change intensifies, it is quite clear that every component of the 
economic system will be subject to scrutiny with regard to what it can contribute to adaptation 
and mitigation. From a broader perspective, while climate change is for the moment the most 
salient  of  issues  relating  to  sustainability,  there  are  a  host  of  other  factors  on  the  radar 
screen, which will sooner or later engage the attention of national and global regulators. On 
all these fronts, the financial system will be expected to play a role, whether it is in the form 
of  channelizing  resources  to  firms  that  have  good  sustainability  practices,  or  financing 
innovation in and development of “green” technologies or even contributing to insurance and 
safety-net mechanisms for people who are likely to be adversely impacted by the changes. 
In  this  segment  of  my  remarks,  I  have  articulated  the  view  that  effective  financial  sector 
development  must  simultaneously  pursue  five  objectives;  some  are  defined  by  tradition, 
while others reflect changing global and domestic priorities. I have hinted at possible conflicts 
between some of these objectives. Finding the right balance between them is clearly the goal 
of financial sector policy and regulation, but this is not the place to go into that set of issues. I 
shall now try and provide a brief description of how both the idea of deposit insurance itself 
and  the  way  in  which  it  is  provided  relate  to  the  five  broad  objectives  of  financial  sector 
development. 
The role of deposit insurance  
Deposit insurance has clearly been around for a long time and its utility as an instrument of 
trust and confidence in the financial (or perhaps more narrowly in the banking) system has 
rarely  been  in  question.  Rather,  the  question  that  now  faces  us  is  whether  it  can  be 
expanded  and  re-structured  to  address  a  greater  variety  of  requirements  that  the  financial 
system  now  has.  These  are  issues  that  will  obviously  be  discussed  during  the  technical 
sessions of this conference and I look forward to being informed of the significant points that 
emerge from them, both for my own education and as inputs into the shaping of strategies for 
DICGC. Here, I will confine myself to a few illustrations of how deposit insurance fits into the 
broader financial development framework. 
With regard to efficiency, the existence of insurance is perhaps less important than the way 
in  which  it  is  structured.  Deposit-taking  financial  institutions,  particularly  those  servicing  a 
large number of relatively small accounts can obviously be mandated to buy insurance. But, 
this will impact their operating costs, which depositors will bear to some extent. One way of 
encouraging  overall  efficiency  is  to  differentiate  insurance  premiums  between  institutions 
based on some objective measure of the riskiness of their loan and asset portfolios. This will 
help  to  bring  about  a  better  alignment  between  the  cost  of  funds  and  the  portfolio  risks 
across the deposit-taking financial sector. 
Stability  is  clearly  the  objective  with  the  most  direct  connection  with deposit  insurance.  By 
providing depositors with the assurance that at least some of their money is safe no matter 
what happens to the institution, it provides a huge incentive for people to use the system, 
with  consequent  benefits  for  the  economy  as  a  whole.  But,  the  viability  of  any  insurance 
scheme  is  based  essentially  on  the  premise  that  claims  will  originate  from  only  a  small 
proportion of the insured population at any given time. A crisis is a situation in which virtually 
the entire population will make claims at the same time. From a welfare perspective, the core 
objective  of  protecting  depositors’  interests  becomes  even  more  paramount  in  such  a 
situation.  However,  from  the  perspective  of  resources,  the  cost  providing  full  insurance 
against  catastrophic  failure  can  be  very  high  for  individual  institutions,  coming  into  conflict 
with  efficiency  considerations.  Where,  then,  the  resources  needed  to  continue  to  inspire 
confidence in the system are going to come from is a critical question. Strategic management 
of the insurance corpus and conditional state support will, presumably, both have a role. 
BIS Review 6/2010

One important consideration that is on our own strategic agenda is the role of the deposit 
insurer  in  the  resolution  process  itself.  When  individual  institutions  fail,  rather  than  let  the 
depositor be rescued solely by the insurance cover, which in any case, is not comprehensive 
for larger depositors, it may be more effective to involve the insurer in the process right from 
the  beginning.  This  will  give  depositors  as  a  stakeholder  group  a  voice  in  the  process, 
allowing them to better protect their interests, while at the same time increasing the capacity 
of the insurance scheme. Of course, in this expanded role, the organizational design and skill 
requirements of the insurance provider need to be kept in mind. 
Transparency  is  a  two-way  street.  Depositors  need  to  be  fully  aware  of  the  extent  of 
protection, what it is costing the institution and the limitations on protection in the event of a 
systemic failure. The insurer needs to know precisely who each depositor is and the size of 
his/her exposure. This will enable speedy resolution of claims, which is a critical requirement 
for an effective insurance programme.  
With  regard  to  inclusion,  deposit  insurance  is  clearly  very  relevant  in  a  situation  such  as 
India’s. A large number of people interfacing with the organized financial system for the first 
time will naturally be very concerned about the safety of their funds. At the same time, there 
is a welfare imperative of protecting this category of depositors from both strategic errors by 
management and wider systemic shocks. Of course, this consideration brings into focus the 
potential  conflict  between  the  inclusion  objective  and  the  efficiency  objective;  if  relatively 
more  vulnerable  institutions  also  happen  to  be  more  effective  in  pursuing  an  inclusion 
agenda, some degree of cross-subsidization may be necessary. 
Finally, on the issue of sustainability, while a direct link with deposit insurance is difficult to 
make, the wider requirement for insurance in a scenario of long-term environmental change 
and the vulnerabilities of several production systems to it – for example, agriculture, fisheries 
and tourism – is well recognized. Such risks will also have to be borne by financial service 
providers who are exposed to these sectors, which may have implications for, among other 
things, deposit insurance. 
Conclusion 
I  would  like  to  conclude  by  re-emphasizing  the  point  that  the  future  trajectory  of  deposit 
insurance programmes is best viewed in the context of an explicit vision and framework for 
the financial sector as a whole. I have attempted to offer one way of doing this, which, I hope, 
will be useful to you as you get into the agenda items of the conference. My best wishes to 
all of you for a substantial and meaningful event. Thank you all for being here and special 
thanks to Mr. Prasad and his team for their efforts in arranging this event.  
José Manuel González-Páramo: The regulatory and supervisory reform in 
Europe 
Speech  by  Mr  José  Manuel  González-Páramo,  Member  of  the  Executive  Board  of  the 
European Central Bank, at the presentation of the Report “Observatorio sobre la reforma de 
los mercados financieros 2009, realizado por la Fundación de Estudios Financieros”, Madrid, 
22 January 2010.

Introduction 
Ladies and Gentlemen,1 
I am very glad to participate this morning in the presentation of the latest “Observatorio” from 
the  Fundación  de  Estudios  Financieros  (FEF).2  This  year’s  report  is  dedicated  to  the  very 
important issue of the Reform of the European Financial Markets. The current financial crisis 
has  revealed  a  number  of  deficiencies  in  the  European  and  international  regulatory 
framework,  which  need  to  be  addressed  in  order  to  place  our  financial  systems  and 
economies on a more solid footing. 
As  a  result,  a  number  of  initiatives  have  been  undertaken  in  the  relevant  European  and 
international  fora.  The  number  and  breadth  of  these  initiatives  is  impressive  and  very 
promising.  The  report  from  FEF  provides  a  very  comprehensive  survey  of  all  the  current 
initiatives, identifying the various strands of work and summarising the main implications for 
the financial sector and markets. I congratulate the authors on this exhaustive report, which 
represents  a  very  useful  reference  for  whoever  is  interested  in  understanding  the  ongoing 
developments in the regulatory and supervisory field.  
Of  course,  the  reader  may  not  necessarily  agree  with  all  conclusions  of  the  report.  In 
particular, the report identifies a major risk of over-regulation and instead stresses the virtues 
from industry self-regulation. I beg to disagree. In my view, the main risk right now is not to 
do too much, but rather that we do too little.  
There is a serious risk that the gradual improvement of conditions in the financial markets 
and the banking industry may diminish the sense of urgency and necessity of implementing 
reforms identified as essential to prevent the occurrence of similar crises in the future. Albert 
Hirschman, the American economist, noted that in many of the debates that precede social 
and  political  reforms  of  historical  magnitude,  the  proposed  changes  are  typically  met  with 
three  arguments:  (1)  that  they  would  produce  perverse  effects,  (2)  that  they  would  be 
ineffectual, and (3) that they would jeopardise previous achievements.3 I am afraid that we 
are now increasingly hearing the same arguments in the context of the debate on financial 
reform.  
The crisis which began in the summer of 2007 has developed over time into one of the most 
disruptive and costly crises for our economies and societies that the world has experienced 
in  many  decades.  Therefore,  both  public  authorities  and  the  financial  market  participants 
have  a  collective  responsibility  to  do  whatever  is  needed  to  address  weaknesses  in  the 
regulatory and supervisory framework in order to provide sounder foundations to our financial 
systems.  
Let me now stress some of the areas in which substantial work has been achieved to design 
and implement reforms. 
Three key areas of reform: credit rating agencies, hedge funds and compensation 
practices 
As  I  mentioned  earlier,  substantive  progress  has  been  made  in  the  regulatory  and 
supervisory reform as a response to the financial crisis. A remarkable amount of technical

work  has  been  undertaken  in  a  demanding  timeframe.  All  relevant  initiatives  have  been 
coordinated globally, and the European Union has been a frontrunner in a number key areas. 
Three areas in which much progress has been made are: credit rating agencies, hedge funds 
and compensation practices.  
• 
investment 
that  alternative 
As regards credit rating agencies, a new EU regulation subjecting such agencies to 
mandatory registration and oversight in order to increase transparency and reduce 
conflicts of interest in the rating process has already entered into force in December 
2009.  
As  for  hedge  funds,  the  European  Commission  has  proposed  a  Directive  on 
alternative  investment  fund  managers.  This  proposal,  which  is  currently  under 
debate,  provides 
to 
authorisation  and  harmonised  regulatory  standards,  including  minimum  capital  as 
well as disclosure requirements.  
On  compensation  practices,  the  European  Commission  was  among  the  first  to 
incorporate  in  a  Directive  proposal  the  Principles  developed  by  the  Financial 
Stability  Board  (FSB) 
for  sound  compensation  practices,  with  a  projected 
implementation  date  of  end-2010.  In  this  context,  the  EU  was  leading  the 
international agenda in developing further guidance to align compensation practices 
with long-term value creation and discourage excessive risk-taking in the short-term. 
To  recall,  the  G20  leaders  in  Pittsburgh  in  September  endorsed  the  FSB 
implementation  standards  that  aim  to  defer  bonus  payments,  disallow  guaranteed 
bonuses, and introduce a claw-back clause. 
fund  managers  be  subject 
  Recent proposals on how to strengthen the prudential framework 
In addition, agreement has been reached globally on a comprehensive set of measures to 
strengthen the prudential framework in response to the crisis. In the EU, the Commission’s 
proposal for an amendment of the Capital Requirements Directive of July 2009 includes the 
internationally agreed stricter requirements for trading book and re-securitisations.  
Moreover, the recently issued proposals of the Basel Committee aim at improving the quality, 
consistency  and  transparency  of  capital  for  credit  institutions  as  well  as  developing  a 
framework for liquidity risk. As a consequence, the quality of capital, especially the so called 
Tier-1 capital which is of utmost importance for loss-absorption on going concern and crisis 
situations, will significantly improve.  
• 
The  risk  coverage  of  capital  requirements  will  be  further  strengthened  for  the 
counterparty risk related to derivatives, repos and securities financing activities, and 
incentives  will  be  increased  to  move  OTC  derivative  exposures  to  central 
counterparties and exchanges.  
A leverage ratio will be introduced as a supplementary measure to the Basel II risk 
control framework to curb excessive balance sheet growth and to safeguard against 
model risk and measurement error.  
Capital  buffers  and  forward-looking  provisioning  will  be  introduced  to  mitigate  the 
inherent procyclical nature of financial activities.  
Finally, a global minimum liquidity risk standard for internationally active banks will 
be  put  in  place,  requiring  banks  to  hold  sufficient  high-quality  liquid  assets  to 
withstand financial stress.  
   These proposed measures have the support of the Group  of Central Bank Governors and 
Heads of Supervision, who requested the Committee to deliver a fully calibrated and finalised 
package of reforms by the end of 2010. The Commission envisages the timely incorporation 
of the aforementioned upcoming regulatory changes in the EU framework.

 BIS Review 6/2010
Recent developments in European prudential framework 
Finally, international cooperation has been strongly reinforced and supervisory colleges for 
large  complex  financial  groups  have  been  established.  At  EU  level,  the  setting  up  and 
functioning of colleges is provided for in the EU regulatory framework and is well advanced.  
Looking ahead, legislative proposals should fully reflect the ongoing work at international and 
EU level aiming at enhancing the resilience of the financial system and protect consumers 
and investors against the impact of excessive risk taking and irresponsible market practices. 
Main priorities include: (1) finalising the reform of the prudential framework; (2) addressing 
the  risks  posed  by  systemically  important  institutions;  and  (3)  setting  a  framework  for 
macro-prudential supervision. 
• 
First, the strengthened prudential framework currently being developed needs to be 
properly  and  timely  finalised.  The  agreed  measures,  when  implemented,  will 
address many of the shortcoming highlighted by the financial crisis, and will increase 
the ability of financial institutions to withstand shocks and thus the resilience of the 
financial  system.  In  this  context,  let  me  highlight  the  importance  of  a  thorough 
impact  assessment,  to  be  carried  out  in  the  course  of  this  year,  before  the  final 
calibration of the framework can be made. The exact timing of implementation has, 
equally, to be carefully considered, so that the economic and financial recovery will 
not  be  endangered.  In  this  context,  adequate  transition  and  grandfathering 
arrangements should be ensured. 
Second, legislative reform also needs to address the moral hazard stemming from 
systemically important financial institutions. In a resilient financial system it cannot 
and should not be taken for granted that authorities will always come to the rescue. 
The focus of the ongoing work by the FSB in this regard is threefold:  
1. 
It  seeks  to  ensure  that  financial  institutions,  whatever  their  size  and 
interconnectedness, should not cause undue distress to the functioning of the 
financial system and to the economy as a whole, if and when mismanagement 
drive  them  to  bankruptcy.  Possible  tools  include  introducing  capital  and 
liquidity surcharges, or constraining size or the range of activities, to reduce 
the externalities of systemically important institutions to the society.  
The  core  financial  infrastructures  and  markets  need  to  be  strengthened,  for 
example  via  the  promotion  of  central  counterparty  clearing  and  revision  of 
supervisory standards on financial market infrastructures.  
2. 
3.  We also need to review resolution regimes and bankruptcy laws to ensure an 
orderly  winding-down  of  systemic  cross-border  financial  institutions.  In  this 
respect, the European Commission has already launched a public consultation 
on measures for a new EU framework for crisis management in the banking 
sector, in which policy options as regards early intervention, bank resolution 
and harmonised insolvency procedures are considered. In addition, it will be 
relevant  to  enhance  the  framework  for  coordination  among  the  relevant 
authorities for financial stability in case of crisis.  
the

The  third  and  final  area  relates  to  macro-prudential  supervision.  One  of  the  key 
lessons  stemming 
importance  of 
understanding  and  assessing  the  degree  of  “interconnectedness”  between  market 
participants. In particular, the crisis demonstrated that the nature and magnitude of 
the systemic risk in the financial sector is related not only to the potential illiquidity or 
insolvency of large banks or other major regulated financial institutions, but it also 
depends  on  the  close  intertwining  between  financial  institutions,  markets  and 
infrastructures.  The  financial  stability  framework  needs  to  be  able  to  identify  and 
assess  systemic  risks  corresponding  to  the  degree  of  “interconnectedness”  I  just 
mentioned.  In  this  context,  macro-prudential  oversight  would  focus  on  factors  and

risks  that  can  affect  the  stability  of  the  financial  system  as  a  whole  and  therefore 
would  complement  micro-prudential  supervision,  which  looks  at  the  stability  of 
individual financial institutions. 
Macroprudential supervision in the euro area: The European Systemic Risk Board 
Macroprudential oversight will be the key task of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), 
which is built on the proposals of the High Level Group chaired by Jacques de Larosière. The 
European  Commission’s  legislative  proposals  for  the  establishment  and  functioning  of  the 
ESRB  have  received  the  support  by  the  ECOFIN  and  the  EU  Council.  The  European 
Parliament  is  currently  considering  the  proposals  in  its  turn.  Let  me  also  mention  that  the 
ECB/Eurosystem  expressed  its  stance  in  the  opinion  adopted  on  26  October.  2009  It 
welcomed the broad agreement reached by ECOFIN on the draft legal texts regarding the 
establishment  of  the  ESRB  and  the  involvement  of  the  ECB  in  supporting  the  ESRB.  As 
stated  in  its  Opinion,  the  ECB  has  decided  that  it  stands  ready  to  provide  the  analytical, 
statistical, administrative and logistical support to the ESRB, including the Secretariat of the 
ESRB.  
What  will  be  the  activities  of  the  ESRB  and  what  is  its  value  added?  The  ESRB  will  be 
expected  to  actively  monitor  the  various  sources  of  risk  to  financial  stability  in  the  EU  – 
across  countries  and  across  financial  sectors,  and  also  taking  into  account  global 
developments. As a result of this monitoring, the ESRB can identify the risks and analyse in-
depth  how  they  could  impact  the  financial  system.  Stress-testing  and  other  methodologies 
could assist the risk prioritisation exercise.  
The  value-added  to  be  provided  by  the  ESRB  is  to  link,  in  particular,  macro-economic 
conditions, structural developments, and key vulnerabilities of financial institutions. This will 
permit to identify system-wide risks for the benefit of regulatory and supervisory policies. The 
monitoring, assessment and collection of information on sources of risk to be conducted by 
the  ESRB,  at  the  level  of  the  entire  EU,  is  of  the  essence,  given  the  advanced  financial 
integration  of  the  internal  market.  In  addition,  the  risks  for  Europe  stemming  from  global 
sources will also need to be considered, also in coordination with the IMF and the FSB.  
The financial stability monitoring in the EU as a whole will provide significant analytical and 
informational challenges. A large part of the effectiveness of the ESRB will rely on the quality 
and solidity of the analysis and information underlying its financial stability assessments. It 
will be important to set-up efficient arrangements between the ESRB and the new European 
Supervisory Authorities for the mutual cooperation and exchange of information, as foreseen 
in the Commission’s legislative proposals. This would allow avoiding multiple reporting from 
financial institutions. 
In order to support the new European macro-prudential function, as decided by the Ecofin, 
the ECB will provide analytical, statistical, administrative and logistical support, also drawing 
on  the  technical  advice  of  the  27  national  central  banks  and  supervisors  of  the  Member 
States. Accordingly, we will optimise our present capabilities and infrastructure in the areas 
of  financial  stability  monitoring,  macro-economic  analysis,  and  collection  of  statistical 
information,  to  the  benefit  of  the  ESRB.  This  aims  at  reaping  the  maximum  synergies  in 
terms of expertise, resources and infrastructures with the existing central bank activities in 
the EU. To this aim, preparatory work is already under way.  
Let  me  now  conclude  by  saying  that  although  much  has  been  achieved  to  improve  the 
European  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework,  a  lot  still  remains  to  be  done.  This  is  no 
time  for  complacency.  We  still  need  to  make  further  progress  to  create  a  supervisory  and 
regulatory  framework,  both  micro  and  macroprudential,  in  which  a  strong  and  competitive 
financial  system  can  enjoy  sustainable  growth.  Europe  should  play  a  leading  role in  these 
developments.  
Thank you for your attention.
