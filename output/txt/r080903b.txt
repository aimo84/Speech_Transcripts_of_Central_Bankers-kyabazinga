Thomas Jordan: Monetary policy – achieving a balance between inflation 
and growth 
Summary of a speech by Mr Thomas Jordan, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss 
National Bank, at the annual meeting of the Swiss Venture Club, Berne, 2 September 2008. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 Following several settled years, the international downturn in the economy, high commodity 
prices and the ongoing financial market crisis is challenging central banks on a number of 
fronts simultaneously. By comparison with other countries, Switzerland is in a relatively good 
position thanks to the continued strength of consumption, full order books, full employment, 
low inflation by international standards and few excesses in the real estate market.  
However, the global economic decline is likely to reach Switzerland, albeit with a certain lag. 
In  particular,  the  economic  slowdown  now  becoming  apparent  in  Europe  could  have  a 
considerable impact on the Swiss business cycle by reducing the demand for our exports. 
Moreover, the pessimistic mood in the financial markets is not likely to be conducive to the 
creation  of  value  in  the  financial  sector.  However,  the  relative  stability  of  the  Swiss  franc 
should continue to support our exports.  
The recent rise in the Swiss rate of inflation to over 3% is mainly attributable to first round 
effects, i.e. to the direct results of the increase in oil prices. If, as expected, second round 
effects remain contained, the rate of inflation should drop back below 2% during the course 
of  2009,  and  long-term  inflation  expectations  should  remain  low.  Based  on  these 
assumptions, current monetary policy is appropriate. However, if inflation does not fall back 
due to second round effects as expected, the SNB would need to counter this development 
in order to anchor price stability.
