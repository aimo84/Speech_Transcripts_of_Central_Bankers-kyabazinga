Mr Thahane discusses Asia’s economic
recovery and its implications for the African Renaissance
Address  by  Dr  Tim  Thahane,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  South  African  Reserve  Bank,  at  the
African-Asian Society, held in Sandton, South Africa, on 5 October 1999.
 Introduction
1.
The recovery of  Asia’s  economies  in 1999, from  the  very  damaging  crises that  began in  mid-1997,
provides significant scope for the development of the African countries and a meaningful contribution
to  African  Renaissance.  Since  1994,  the  African  economies  have  on  aggregate  traded  significantly
with the Asian economies reflecting the vast potential benefit that African countries stand to gain from
a vigorous and sustained recovery in Asian economies. Asia’s trade surplus to Africa, which stood at
US$4.6  billion  in  1994,  decreased  to  a  deficit  of  US$1.1  billion  in  1997,  before  increasing
substantially to US$5.1 billion in 1998 following the Asian crisis.
I will comment first on Japan and then the post-crisis recovery of the Asian economies, of Thailand,
the  Philippines,  Malaysia,  Indonesia  and  Korea.  Second,  I  will  define  the  concept  of  African
Renaissance and  the  potential  contribution  of  the  Asian  economic  recovery  to  African  Renaissance.
Finally,  I  will  briefly  touch  on  the  ability  of  the  Asian  countries  to  combine  their  culture  with  the
acquisition and development of the most advanced technologies and globalization process.
Japan’s economic recovery
2.
There is a worldwide consensus that a strong economic revival of Japan’s economy would herald  a
significant recovery for the Asian economies as a whole. Japan’s annual real GDP growth rate, which
fell to -2.8% in 1998 is expected to increase significantly to 1.0% in 1999 and to 1.5% by the year
2000. The annual inflation rate in Japan, which rose from 0.1% in 1996 to 1.7% and 0.6% in 1997 and
1998  respectively,  is  expected  to  drop  to  -0.4%  by  the  end  of  1999.  The  annual  current  account
balance in Japan, which reached a deficit of US$121 billion in 1998, is expected to increase further to
US$143 billion in 1999 before falling somewhat to US$138 billion in 2000. This expected turnaround
in the performance of the Japanese economy is not only critical for Africa’s development but for the
whole world.
Japan  undertakes  significant  direct  trade  with  Africa.  Japanese  imports  from  Africa  were
US$3.9 billion in 1994, and increased to US$4.9 billion in 1996, before declining to US$3.8 billion in
1998  following  the  Asian  crisis.  Similarly,  Japanese  exports  to  Africa  increased  significantly  from
US$5.8 billion  in  1994  to  US$6.3  billion  in  1996,  before  dropping  to  US$4.2  billion  in  1998  and
US$4.5  billion  in  1999.  The  Japanese  economy  had  a  trade  surplus  of  US$1.8  billion  with  African
countries in 1994 and 1995. It turned around to deficits of US$85.4 million and US$515.0 million in
1996 and 1997, respectively, following Japan’s economic slowdown and strengthening of the yen in
1996. The challenge to African economies is to become more competitive in Asian markets, so as to
turnaround the trade surplus of US$644.0 million in 1998.
trade  deficit  with  SADC  decreased  from  US$476.4  million 
The situation is slightly different with SADC. Since 1994, Japan has operated with a significant trade
deficit.  Japan’s 
to
US$284.6 million  in  1995  and  then  significantly  increased  to  US$1.0  billion  in  1997  before  falling
somewhat  to  US$747.8  million  in  1998.  SADC  would  benefit  significantly  from  Japan’s  economic
revival if it were to sustain the level of competitiveness that it has attained thus far. This requires a
clear export focus and strategy vis-à-vis the huge Japanese market. It is important not to forget that
Japan is the second largest economy in the world and Japan is well-disposed to Africa at this stage.

Asia’s economic recovery
3.
Following  worldwide  crises  that  developed  from  the  southeast  Asian  economies,  recent  indications
point to a promising economic revival in Asia as a  whole, particularly  in  those countries  where  the
crisis  was  most  severe:  Thailand;  the  Philippines;  Indonesia;  Malaysia  and  Korea.  The  combined
annual real GDP growth rate of these countries fell from 6.6% in 1997 to 3.7% in 1998 with severe
impact on the gains that had been made to reduce poverty and generate jobs. Growth is now expected
to significantly increase to 5.3% in 1999 and 5.4% by 2000. The annual inflation rate which reached a
high  of  8.0%  in  1998,  is  expected  to  drop  significantly  to  3.1%  and  3.5%  in  1999  and  2000
respectively. The Asian annual current account balance, which stood at a deficit of US$51 billion in
1998 is expected to decline significantly to US$26 billion in 1999 and drop further to US$12 billion in
2000.
Net  private  capital  flows  in  Thailand,  the  Philippines,  Indonesia,  Malaysia  and  Korea  fell  from
US$62.9 billion in 1996 to a negative of US$22.1 billion in 1997 and US$29.6 billion in 1998. They
are expected to improve but remain negative at US$18.1 billion in 1999 and US$8.2 billion in 2000.
Net  direct  foreign  investment,  which  has  remained  positive,  is  expected  to  decline  from
US$10.3 billion in 1997 to US$9.7 billion  in 1998.  It  will  still remain  positive  at  US$9.4  billion  in
1999 and US$8.4 billion in 2000. Net portfolio investments, which were a negative US$7.3 billion in
1998  are  expected  to  improve  significantly  to  positive  levels  of  US$4.5  billion  in  1999  and
US$5.6 billion  in  2000.  The  annual  current  account  deficits  of  Thailand,  the  Philippines,  Malaysia,
Indonesia  and  Korea  are  expected  to  improve  from  a  high  of  US$68.8  billion  in  1998  to
US$49.3 billion in 1999 and US$29.4 billion in 2000.
The  annual external  debt of  Asia, as  a percentage  of exports of  goods  and  services,  which  stood at
118.6% in 1998, is expected to decline to 112.5% in 1999 and to 107.9% in 2000. Annual debt service
payments are expected to decline from a high of 19.5% in 1998 to 15.7% in 1999 and 14.6% in 2000.
The rapid turnaround in these Asian economies is a reflection of the determination and vigour  with
which  the  Asian  leaders  and  their  people  have  tackled  the  challenges  that  faced  them.  The
international community has played a supportive, though important role in this process of economic
recovery. This is one of the major lessons that Africa can draw from this experience.
African Renaissance
4.
The  concept  of  the  African  Renaissance  generally  captures  an  array  of  important  social,  political,
economic and cultural aspects that epitomize a revival and vibrant African continent. These various
spheres, among others, include education, science and technology. A concerted effort is underway at
regional  and continental forums  to  give  content  and  meaning  to  the  concept  and  to  define  concrete
action  plans  to  bring  it  to  reality  early  in  the  21st  century.  An  African  Renaissance  Institute  to  be
located  in  Botswana  is  soon  to  be  launched.  It  will  be  followed  by  a  launch  of  national  chapters
including the South African chapter by the first quarter of next year. African Renaissance involves not
only governments but more importantly civil society and people at community and local levels who
seek to improve the quality of their lives and to hold their leaders accountable.
For  our  purposes,  it  would  be  expedient  to  focus  on  some  of  the  economic  aspects  of  the  African
Renaissance,  primarily  prospects  of  Africa’s  economic  growth,  reconstruction  and  development
through  enhanced  intra-  and  inter-continental  trade.  In  this  context,  African  Renaissance  calls  for
increased economic integration within the African continent to enlarge markets, facilitate free flow of
investment, goods and labour. It calls for a more effective participation in the economic globalization
process by the African countries and people by embracing change and technology. In this context, the
relations with Asia and the lessons it provides are critical lessons for African revival and re-birth.
The economic development of the African continent as a whole lags significantly behind in terms of
its  contributions  to  global  economic  output.  Africa  contributed  only  3.3%  of  the  aggregate  world
economic GDP in 1998 – exactly what the United Kingdom contributed as a single country. Africa’s
total share in the global export market of goods and services stood at a paltry 1.8% in 1998 compared
to Asia’s 8.1% or the United States’ 13.8%. This means that Africa has a long way to go to improve its
2
BIS Review 107/1999
contribution to world trade by improving its productivity capability, competitiveness and harnessing of
technology and skills.
Asian recovery and the African Renaissance
5.
The  revival  and  sustenance  of  vigorous  growth  in  the  Asian  economies  would  almost  certainly
enhance  the  development  of  an  African  Renaissance.  Since  1994  and  through  the  crisis  of  1997,
African-Asian trade has been significant. Trade account figures between Africa and Asia indicate that
total  annual  Asian  imports  from  Africa  almost  doubled  from  US$7.4  billion  in  1994  to
US$14.3 billion in 1997, before receding somewhat to US$9.5 billion in 1998. Imports from SADC
alone  were  US$4.6  billion  in  1994  and  almost  doubled  to  reach  US$9.0  billion  in  1997  before
dropping to US$5.8 billion in 1998.
During  the  same  period,  Asian  exports  to  Africa  have  been  fluctuating  somewhat  between
US$11 billion  and  US$13  billion  from  1994  to  1997  before  increasing  to  US$14.5  billion  in  1998.
Annual  exports  to  SADC  increased  from  US$3.4  billion  in  1994  to  US$5.6  billion  in  1997  with  a
marginal decline to US$5.5 billion in 1998.
The net effect has sustained Asia as being a net exporter within the Asian-African trade with a surplus
that decreased from US$4.6 billion in 1994 to a deficit of US$1.1 billion in 1997, and revived strongly
to reach US$5.1 billion in 1998. Asia’s net exports to SADC were negative from US$1.2 billion in
1994 to a more substantive deficit of US$3.4 billion in 1997, before a significant improvement in 1998
when a deficit of US$333.4 million was recorded.
The development of the African Renaissance should enable African countries to expand trade with all
Asian economies so as to balance trade between the two continents. More importantly, the challenge
for  Africa  is  to  maintain  and  expand  its  market  share  in  Asia  through  strategic,  competitive  and
targeted export drives.
Social policies
6.
One characteristic feature of the Asian economies has been their ability to combine many aspects of
the Asian culture with acquisition of the highest technical skills and to participate effectively in the
globalization process. Although several studies have alluded to uniquely Asian policies that: (a) have
enhanced  employee  loyalties  to  Asian  corporations;  (b) emphasized  Asian  management  systems;
(c) enhanced a culture of high saving; (d) maintained strong social support systems; etc., it is still very
difficult to tackle the concept of culture within economics. It should suffice, however, to conclude that
the  policies themselves  are  not  uniquely  Asian, but  are  implemented  by  Asians  in  congruence  with
Asian  norms  and  values.  African  Renaissance  must  come  to  grips  with  the  synergy  and
complimentarity of culture and fast and sustainable growth.
The economic crisis resulted in significant output losses in affected Asian economies and contributed
significantly  to  increased  unemployment  rates.  However,  affected  Asian  economies  increased  their
social  safety  nets  and  public  spending  substantially  to  strengthen  their  social  support  systems  and
ensure minimum support levels to those who were worst affected. In Indonesia and Thailand safety net
expenditures  are  expected  to  rise  by  0.5  to  1.0%  of  GDP  in  1999.  In  Korea,  expenditure  on  social
safety nets almost quadrupled from 0.4% of GDP in 1997 to 1.7% in 1999. At the same time, the use
of across-the-board price subsidies have been significantly reduced although some – such as subsidies
on rice – remain an important component of  the  social  policy  framework.  The  African  Renaissance
would  benefit significantly  if it  were to study  in  more  detail  how  the  globally  robust  economies  of
Asia have managed to sustain much of their distinct culture and commitment to improve the quality of
life for all their people.

BIS Review 107/1999
Conclusion
7.
My  remarks  focused  on  the  post-crisis  recovery  of  the  Asian  economies,  with  a  view  to  drawing
lessons from the Asian economic recoveries for the African Renaissance, and to understanding how
Asian countries have managed to sustain their culture despite their economies’ rigorous globalization
programs.
Available evidence suggests that the Asian economies have definitely re-established a path to high and
sustainable economic growth, and are restoring their trade with the world and the African continent.
The  African  Renaissance  process  will  benefit  greatly  from  an  enhanced  African-Asian  trade  and
cooperation at various levels: culturally, scientifically, politically and economically. There is a lot to
be  learnt  from  how  Japan  and  other  Asian  countries  have  been  transformed  through  political
leadership and foresight, acquisition of skills and technology, and a contribution of cultural norms and
aggressive international competitiveness. One major conclusion to be drawn is that a robust embrace
of globalization is not inconsistent with African culture, values and norms.
