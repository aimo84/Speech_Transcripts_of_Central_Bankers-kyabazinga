Loi M Bakani: Commodity and food prices, inflation and monetary policy 
in Papua New Guinea 
Presentation  by  Mr  Loi  M  Bakani,  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Papua  New  Guinea,  to  the 
National Research Institute Food Security Policy Conference on “High food prices in Papua 
New Guinea”, Port Moresby, 6 September 2011. 
 I  wish  to  express  my  gratitude  to  the  National  Research  Institute  for  arranging  this 
conference on food prices in Papua New Guinea and for inviting me here today to make a 
presentation.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  other  policy  makers  and specialists  working  in  this 
crucial  field.  Today  I  will  be  discussing  global  commodity  and  food  prices,  how  this  has 
affected  inflation  in  Papua  New  Guinea,  and  how  the  Bank  of  Papua  New  Guinea  has 
responded to these issues.  
International commodity price boom 
Since 2004, global commodity prices have increased substantially, largely due to increased 
demand  in  resource-intensive  emerging  economies  such  as  China,  which  has  outstripped 
global supply. Other factors have supported this boom, including low interest rates, a weaker 
US  dollar,  and  arguably  some  speculation.  International  food  prices  increased  at  a  slower 
pace during this period until they surged in 2007 and again in 2010, largely due to supply 
constraints.

The commodity price boom has had numerous positive benefits for the PNG economy. First, 
due to increased mining and petroleum export revenues, the Government has been able to 
reduce  its  external  debt,  allowing  for  more  stable  financing  of  the  Budget  and  external 
position.  Moreover,  with  stable  government  financing,  there  has  been  no  central  bank 
financing  of  the  government’s  budget,  which  historically  has  led  to  high  inflation  and 
exchange  rate  depreciation.  Additionally,  the  increased  export  prices  have  contributed  to 
high  GDP  growth,  while  higher  non-mineral  export  prices  have  increased  incomes  and

employment.  Because  of  these  factors,  the  Bank  of  PNG  has  been  able  to  increase  its 
international reserves, while the kina exchange rate has appreciated mildly and been broadly 
stable.  
Impact on inflation in PNG 
These  factors  have  changed  the  nature  of  inflation  in  PNG  in  recent  years.  Historically, 
inflation was relatively stable up through 1994, when PNG maintained a “hard kina” policy. 
During this period from independence through 1994, inflation averaged 5.9 percent.  
However  in  1994,  following  years  of  Government  deficits  and  the  deterioration  of  foreign 
exchange  reserves,  the  Government  was  forced  to  float  the  kina,  reducing  its  value 
substantially  and  leading  to  higher  prices  of  imported  items.  Between  1995  and  2003, 
exchange rate depreciations caused by government deficits and monetization, international 
crises,  a  drought,  and  consequently  low  foreign  exchange  reserves  led  to  high  inflation, 
averaging 12.6 percent.  
Since  2004,  however,  strong  and  increasing  export  prices  led  to  stable  government 
revenues, a build-up in reserves, and a stable exchange rate, leading to the lowest inflation 
in PNG’s history between 2004 and 2007, when inflation averaged 1.8 percent.

But when the commodity price boom extended to surging international food and oil prices in 
2007  and  again  in  2010,  it  began  to  negatively  affect  the  people  of  PNG  through  higher 
prices for many imported items. Since 2008, inflation has averaged 8.1 percent. For the first 
time in twenty years, higher inflation was not mostly due to exchange rate depreciation, but 
was largely due to external forces that have affected most countries.  
Rising food and fuel prices have affected inflation throughout the world. With food comprising 
a large portion of the consumption basket in developing economies – 40.9 percent in PNG – 
higher prices have significantly increased inflation in both 2008 and again in 2010 and 2011. 
Headline inflation in PNG has trended slightly above developing countries as a whole, while 
PNG’s  trimmed  mean  inflation,  which  excludes  the  most  volatile  components  such  as 
betelnut, has trended very closely to other developing economies over the last 2 years.

Other factors affecting inflation in PNG 
While food prices contributed to 60 percent of PNG’s inflation between March 2008 and June 
2009,  over  the  last  year,  they  have  only  contributed  about  35 percent.  Therefore, 
increasingly, additional pressures are contributing to inflation. After years of strong revenues, 
Government spending has increased dramatically, contributing to strong domestic demand. 
Additionally, PNG’s macroeconomic stability of recent years has led to increased business 
activity and foreign investment, most notably the PNG Liquefied Natural Gas project which is 
currently under construction.  
Moreover, due to the length of this boom in business activity, domestic demand pressures 
have  consistently  exceeded  the  ability  of  domestic  supply  to  increase,  and  inflation 
expectations have increasingly become a factor in price setting and wage negotiations. With 
data  collected  from  our  Business  Liaison  Surveys,  we  can  see  that  wage  expectations 
increased with the food and fuel price surge in 2008. But starting at the end of 2009 – even 
before the current food price surge began – we have seen wage expectations increase to 
their highest sustained levels since our survey began. When expectations of higher inflation 
are built into business costs, higher inflation can become entrenched, and monetary policy 
must then also decrease these expectations to reduce inflation.

Thus,  since  2007,  inflation  in  PNG  has  been  affected  mainly  by  these  factors:  1)  external 
food  and  fuel  prices;  2)  increased  domestic  demand  due  to  high  government  spending, 
business activity, and LNG project construction; and, increasingly, 3) inflation expectations. 
Role of monetary policy 
The Bank of PNG has some tools to affect these inflation developments, but when it comes 
to externally driven factors such as food prices, PNG is a price taker, and the main challenge 
is for the Bank to limit these prices passing on to other prices. Moreover, with much of the 
current business boom driven by the LNG project, the Bank of PNG can only have a limited 
effect on demand conditions.  
In this scenario, tightening monetary policy through increasing interest rates could potentially 
lower  current  consumption  and  demand  to  some  extent;  however,  this  does  little  to  affect 
imported food price inflation,  government spending, and LNG construction, although it could 
have a slight effect on expectations. Moreover, a severe monetary tightening could increase 
the effects of Dutch Disease by reducing the ability of the rest of the private sector to expand. 
In fact, private sector credit growth has already slowed. Although it was high up through early 
2009, since then, it has decreased to a relatively low level of around 10 percent annual growth. 
Otherwise,  there  is  some  potential  for  the  kina  exchange  rate  to  appreciate  further.  This 
would lower the cost of imported prices, which would benefit urban consumers, while also 
dampening export revenue due to lower export prices in kina terms, which would negatively 
affect rural exporters and government revenues. Between the first quarter of 2010 and the 
second quarter of 2011, food prices increased by about 34 percent in US dollar terms, while 
the kina appreciated against the US dollar by around 13 percent, thereby containing the price 
of imported food. However, kina appreciation would not be able to fully offset international 
food prices, or if it were, it would introduce volatility and require an unsustainable sell-off of 
international reserves.

This  appreciation  has  come  at  the  cost  of  exports,  with  the  13 percent  kina  appreciation 
against the US dollar moderating the export prices for both mineral and non-mineral exports, 
which rose by about 50 percent and 60 percent, respectively, in US dollar terms. However, 
even in kina terms, with mineral and non-mineral export prices much higher than one year 
ago, there may have been room for more appreciation of the kina.

Fiscal and monetary policy coordination 
The  strong  Government  revenues  in  recent  years  have  led  to  a  rapid  expansion  in 
Government  expenditure.  Although 
the 
Government to spend on, during a period of high demand pressures, the government should 
prioritize  spending  on  non-competing  sectors  and  only  gradually  increase  expenditure  to 
improve  the  quality  of  spending.  In doing  so,  the  government  should  invest  education  and 
workforce  training,  health,  and  law  and  order,  while  avoiding  large  construction  projects. 
Moreover,  investing  in  agriculture  to  help  make  the  industry  more  competitive  will  help 
mitigate the effects of Dutch Disease. 
Furthermore, the strong Government revenues in recent years have led to the accumulation 
of Government deposits. This affects monetary policy because the Government has placed 
the majority of the deposits, currently around 2.5 billion kina, at commercial banks, which the 
Bank of PNG has then sterilized through Central Bank Bill issuance. This poor coordination 
may cost the Bank of PNG, and ultimately the Government, around K70 million per year in 
interest costs.

Moreover,  when  these  deposits  are  drawn  down,  they  will  contribute  to  domestic  demand 
and imports. The Bank of PNG holds foreign currency reserves to offset this future exchange 
rate  pressure,  but  a  rapid  drawdown  of  these  deposits  would  still  be  disruptive  and  would 
likely result in wasteful spending. 
Outlook 
Demand pressures associated with LNG construction and high growth will continue to affect 
inflation  in  the  coming  years.  Although  international  commodity  and  food  prices  have 
stabilized in recent months, it is still expected that they will remain high in the near future. 
This  will  continue  to  present  challenges  to  Papua  New  Guinea  and  we  can  expect  that 
imported  food  and  fuel  prices  will  continue  to  contribute  to  inflationary  pressures  in  PNG. 
This calls for close and effective monitoring of food prices by the ICCC.  
This will raise the cost of imported food, but it also presents an opportunity to increase local 
food  production  which  would  reduce  dependence  on  imports  in  urban  areas.  Although 
estimates have shown that only 20 percent of the food consumed in PNG is imported, it may 
be as high as 50 percent in urban areas.1 There is, therefore, a clear market for increased 
local production and distribution. 
Also, while the government may continue to benefit from high revenues, the management of 
these revenues is increasingly an issue for both fiscal and monetary policy. Therefore, the 
Bank  of  PNG  continues  to  call  for  the  Government  to  allow  it  to  establish  an  overseas 
account  to  manage  windfall  mineral  tax  revenue  prior  to  the  establishment  of  a  Sovereign 
Wealth Fund for the LNG Project. This would also assist the Government in smoothing out 
expenditure  which  would  reduce  domestic  demand  and  inflationary  pressures  while  also 
increasing the quality of spending.  
Furthermore, there is still the potential for commodity prices to drop, of a weather or conflict-
related crisis causing a reduction in exports, or of some slowdown in the construction of the 
LNG  project.  The  Government  should  plan  for  these  possibilities  by  saving  appropriately 
during the boom so that it can continue expenditure during any revenue shortfalls. It should 
not  increase  expenditure  in  expectation  of  higher  future  revenue  when  there  are  already 
issues with spending quality. 
Thank you.
