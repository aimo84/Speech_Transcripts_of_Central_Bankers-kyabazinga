Bank  of  Japan
Monetary Policy Divergence and Global Financial Stability: 
From the Perspective of Demand and Supply of Safe Assets 
Speech at a Meeting Hosted by

Introduction 
In  February  2008,  the  Financial  Times  ran  an  article  describing  the  Bank  of  Japan  as  "Fortress 
Japan."  The  article  noted  that  the  Bank  was  functioning  as  a  fortress  for  Japan,  shielding  the 
Japanese financial system from the turmoil in the global financial markets triggered by problems in 
the  U.S.  subprime  mortgage  loan  market.  As  you  know,  the  Bank′s  objective  of  maintaining 
financial system stability is as important as that of maintaining price stability. In order to fulfill this 
responsibility,  not  only  is  it  important  to  uphold  a  microprudential  perspective,  which  aims  to 
understand  the  risks  faced  by  individual  financial  institutions  and  encourages  management 
responses  thereto,  but  it  also  is  important  to  formulate  and  implement  policies  from  a 
macroprudential perspective, which aims to analyze and evaluate risks to the financial system as a 
whole. 
Following the recent global financial crisis, the financial landscape is radically changing, with U.S. 
and  European  banks  shrinking  their  balance  sheets  and  non-banks,  such  as  investment  funds, 
increasing  their  significance.  At  the  same  time,  in  the  sphere  of  monetary  policy,  we  are  now 
experiencing monetary policy divergence, where interest rates have been kept low for long periods 
in  both  Japan  and  Europe  but  the  United  States  is  entering  a  rate  increase  cycle.  In  order  to 
maintain financial system stability in such a changing global financial environment, it is necessary 
to  ensure  that  there  are  no  hidden  vulnerabilities  from  both  the  microprudential  and 
macroprudential perspectives. Today, I would like to approach this issue through the looking glass 
of the demand and supply of safe assets. 
 II.  Three Facts Regarding Global Financial Intermediation by Banks 
Before  going  into  my  main  thesis,  let  me  point  out  three  facts  regarding  global  financial 
intermediation by banks. 
First  of  all,  there  is  a  close  connection  between  fluctuations  in  banks'  cross-border  claims  and 
global  economic  activity.  Looking  at  banks'  cross-border  claims  by  destination,  financial  cycles 
have  engulfed  one  region  after  another  (Chart  1).  In  the  early  1980s,  there  was  the  debt  crisis 
centered on Latin America. Later in the decade, we saw the bubble economy in Japan. In the late 
1990s, we had the Asian currency crisis, and the 2000s started with a credit bubble in the United 
States and Europe. Most recently, we are worried about debt expansion in emerging Asia. As these 
examples  show,  the  rise  and  fall  of  economic  activity  coincides  with  the  rise  and  fall  of  banks' 
 1 
cross-border claims. 
Secondly,  looking  at  the  nationality of  banks  extending  U.S. dollar-denominated  foreign  claims, 
non-U.S. banks overwhelm U.S. banks in terms of market share (Chart 2). Regarding the currency 
composition of banks' foreign claims, with the exception of intra-European claims, more of which 
are now in euros, a large part of the claims globally is denominated in dollars; yen use is still not 
very common.1  In one respect, this reflects the fact that, with much of global trade and financial 
transactions  being  conducted  in  dollars,  non-U.S.  banks  are  financially  supporting  cross-border 
activities, especially those of national firms. 
Lastly,  regarding  the  U.S.  dollar  funding  of  non-U.S.  banks,  the  reliance  on  foreign  exchange 
swaps (FX swaps) is trending higher (Chart 2). When non-U.S. banks extend credit in dollars, they 
have to fund themselves in dollars, and often their on-balance-sheet credit extensions exceed their 
funding in dollars. This gap in funding is usually covered by FX swaps, which exchange domestic 
currency with dollars. In an FX swap, the parties to the transaction simultaneously conclude the 
purchase and sale of two different currencies of equal value on two separate delivery dates in the 
opposing direction. For example, a Japanese bank would purchase some dollars against the yen in 
the  spot  market  and  yen against  the  same  amount  of  dollars  in  the  forward  market,  which  is  in 
effect obtaining dollars against yen collateral. The reliance on FX swaps can be approximated by 
dividing the dollar funding gap by foreign claims. It can be seen that the ratio is trending higher in 
the long term, with instances of sharp dips during periods of market stress. 
Putting these facts together, one can conclude that it is important to monitor and analyze carefully 
the  dollar  funding  environment  of  non-U.S.  banks  as  a  window  onto  the  stability  and  potential 
vulnerability  of  the  global  economy  and  the  international  financial  system.  Looking  also  at  the 
foreign  claims  of  non-U.S.  banks  by  nationality,  following  the  recent  global  financial  crisis, 
European banks are deleveraging while Japanese banks are enlarging their balance sheets (Chart 3). 
This is one reason why I feel there is a need to be vigilant regarding the international financial 
intermediation activities of Japanese banks. 
 III. The Foreign Exchange Swap Market and Monetary Policy Divergence 
Let us now focus on the FX swap market, which offers important clues regarding developments in 
                                                  
1  For developments in bank lending by currency, see the following: Avdjiev, S. and E. Takáts, "Monetary 
Policy  Spillovers  and  Currency  Networks  in  Cross-border  Bank  Lending,"  BIS  Working  Papers,  No.549,

global financial markets. 
In textbooks on finance, it is said that "covered interest rate parity" will hold. For example, the 
effective interest rate when funding U.S. dollars through the FX swap market and the going rate in 
the  U.S.  short-term  money  market  (i.e.,  LIBOR) should  be  identical.  The  basis  of  this  textbook 
view is that, if the former is higher than the latter, there is an arbitrage opportunity, which will be 
exploited by a bank lending dollars raised in the short-term money market to takers in the FX swap 
market, until the opportunity is arbitraged away. 
Increases in Dollar Funding Premia in the Foreign Exchange Swap Market 
In  real  life,  however,  covered  interest  rate  parity  does  not  always  hold,  contrary  to  what  the 
textbooks say. We often see periods where U.S. dollar funding costs through the FX swap market 
exceed the funding costs through the U.S. short-term money markets (Chart 4). Of these periods, in 
cases like the Japanese financial crisis in the late 1990s, the recent global financial crisis from 2008 
onwards, and the euro area debt crisis between 2011 and 2012, the increases in the spreads over 
LIBOR, or the dollar funding premia in the FX swap market, seem to have been brought about by 
the deterioration in the creditworthiness of banks trying to raise dollar funds. This happens when 
(a) banks with shaky credit increasingly rely on funding dollars against home-currency collateral 
through the FX swap market as they face growing difficulties in obtaining uncollateralized funding 
in the U.S. short-term money market; (b) banks' counterparties, meanwhile, become increasingly 
reluctant to lend dollars due to concerns over counterparty credit risk, because those counterparties 
will incur replacement costs in case of banks' failure even if there was collateral; and (c) as a result, 
tighter  conditions  prevail  in  the  swap  market  and  dollar  funding  premia  for  non-U.S.  banks 
increase. 
Having said this, I should note that the recent increases in the U.S. dollar funding premia in the FX 
swap market are occurring without any obvious problems regarding banks' creditworthiness (Chart 
4).  This  should  imply  that  the  mechanism  for  current  increases  in  the  dollar  funding  premia  is 
different from that of past stress periods. Let me delve a little more into this issue. 
Consequences of Monetary Policy Divergence and Regulatory Reforms 
With the low interest rate environment persisting in Japan and Europe, the United States initiated 
"tapering"  and  entered  a  rate  increase  cycle.  Such  a  divergence  in  monetary  policy  outlook 
influences  the  return-seeking  behavior  of  financial  institutions  and  investors.  Against  the 
background  of  monetary  policy  divergence  between  Japan  and  Europe  on  the  one  hand  and  the 
 3 
United States on the other, the nominal return on U.S. dollar assets is now higher than the return on 
yen or euro assets, and financial institutions and investors in Japan and in Europe are increasing 
their investments in dollar assets (Chart 5). When banks invest in foreign currency denominated 
assets, they generally hedge foreign exchange risk in view of the high capital charges for such risk. 
Such  FX-hedged  investments  in  dollar  assets  are  economically  equivalent  to  transactions  that 
purchase  dollar  assets  with  dollars  obtained  through  FX  swaps  with  yen  or  euros  as  collateral. 
Investments in foreign currency bonds by life insurers are less likely to be hedged compared with 
banks' investments, but slightly less than 70 percent of investments by Japanese life insurers seem 
to  be  hedged  in  recent  years.  The  pattern  of  behavior  suggests  that  recent  monetary  policy 
divergence is encouraging Japanese and European financial institutions to invest in dollar financial 
assets and contributing to tighter market conditions in the FX swap market. 
Meanwhile, this is not the first time that we have experienced monetary policy divergence between 
Japan and the United States. For example,  monetary policies also diverged in the  middle of the 
2000s,  with  the  Bank  of  Japan  continuing  its  quantitative  easing  while  the  Federal  Reserve 
gradually  raised  its  policy  rate,  and  during  this  period,  Japanese  financial  institutions  increased 
their  purchases  of  U.S.  Treasury  paper  and  agency  securities.  The  U.S.  dollar  funding  premia, 
however, did not visibly increase during this period; i.e., broadly speaking, covered interest rate 
parity held (Chart 4). One has to wonder why, in the FX swap market, reactions to monetary policy 
divergence between Japan and the United States differ between then and now. Of the several likely 
explanations,  I  would  like  to  point  out  the  effects  of  regulation  on  banks  that  are  active  in  the 
global financial market.2 
As I noted earlier, if the U.S. dollar funding rate in the FX swap market is higher than the going 
rate in the U.S. short-term money market (i.e., LIBOR), there is an arbitrage opportunity where a 
financial  institution  could  definitely  profit  by  swapping  dollars  obtained  in  the  money  market. 
Nevertheless, when a financial institution wishes to conduct such a transaction, it would have to 
enlarge  its  balance  sheet.  Recently  introduced  financial  regulations,  such  as  the  leverage  ratio, 
which have the effect of increasing capital requirements for balance sheet expansion relative to the 
more traditional risk-based capital ratio, seem to be dampening arbitrage trading. More specifically, 
even  when  the  swap  market  conditions  tighten  due  to  monetary  policy  divergence  between  the 
Unites  States  and  Japan,  U.S.  banks  and  others  that  used  to  provide  dollars  are  not  prepared  to

regulatory  reform  on  market  conditions  in  the  FX  swap  market  from  both  theoretical  and  empirical 
perspectives:  Iida,  T.,  T.  Kimura,  and  N.  Sudo,  "Regulatory  Reforms  and  the  Dollar  Funding  of  Global

increase the supply of dollar funds because of higher costs for arbitrage trading. This is one of the 
reasons why  we  now see  dollar  funding  premia.3  Meanwhile, up  until  the  middle  of  the  2000s, 
regulatory constraints were less acute than today, and it was easier for banks to conduct arbitrage 
trading,  which  in  turn  seemed  to  result  in  a  more  ample  supply  of  dollar  funds  and  little  or  no 
dollar funding premia. 
 IV. Bank Debt and Financial System Stability 
Recent financial regulation reforms are not only affecting the suppliers of U.S. dollars, as we have 
just seen, but also the takers of dollars. For the next few minutes, I would like to touch upon U.S. 
money  market  fund  (MMF)  reform,  which  affected  the  dollar  funding  of  global  financial 
institutions, from the perspective of Japanese banks. 
Changes in Debt Composition at Japanese Banks 
Even in an environment where arbitrage trading by banks supplying U.S. dollars is constrained, the 
dollar  funding  premia  in  the  FX  swap  market  may  decline  if  non-U.S.  financial  institutions 
(including Japanese banks) can shift their funding from the relatively expensive swap market to the 
(uncollateralized) U.S. short-term money market. Considering that there are no serious concerns 
regarding the creditworthiness of non-U.S. banks at this juncture, these banks should be able to 
increase uncollateralized funding through commercial paper (CP) and certificates of deposit (CDs), 
for example. This is not the case, however, because a substantial part of CP and CDs issued by 
non-U.S.  banks  used  to  be  purchased  by  "prime"  MMFs,  and  their  issue  had  to  be  compressed 
considerably, following the U.S. MMF reform, which came into effect last October (Chart 6). The 
reform,  introduced  under  new  U.S.  SEC  rules,  requires  the  adoption  of  floating  net  asset  value 
(NAV) and imposition of redemption fees, and opens the possibility of restricting redemption. This 
prompted a huge shift in funds from prime MMFs to "government" MMFs, which invest mostly in 
U.S. government securities and are exempt from the new rules. This in turn significantly affected 
                                                  
3  The effects of financial regulation are typically observed in the quarter-end spikes of U.S. dollar funding 
costs, as follows: (a) Since around 2013, U.S. banks have deleveraged, due partly to the stricter leverage 
ratio in the United States (in which a higher ratio than international rules is required, and is calculated on the 
basis  of  daily  averaged  assets);  (b)  non-U.S.  banks,  European  banks  in  particular,  which  previously  had 
increased  positions  in  the  U.S.  money  market,  have  started  to  shrink  their  balance  sheets  at  quarter-ends 
since the middle of 2014, partly to hold down the leverage ratio at quarter-ends (in many countries, although 
not in the United States, banks report only the leverage ratio at quarter-ends); (c) at quarter-ends, U.S. banks 
increase  market-making  and  arbitrage-trading  activities  in  the  money  market  at  higher  rates,  inclusive  of 
higher costs posed by regulation.

the dollar funding of global banks. 
The  effects  of  the  MMF  reform  were  not  small,  but  Japanese  banks  were  able  to  cope,  not  by 
compressing their assets, but by changing the composition of their funding (Chart 7). Looking at 
the foreign currency denominated balance sheets of major Japanese banks, for approximately six 
months  preceding  last  October,  they  actually  increased  their  assets,  including  an  increase  of  33 
billion  U.S.  dollars  in  overseas  loans.4  On  the  liabilities  side  of  the  balance  sheet,  there  was  a 
decrease of 62 billion dollars in CP and CD issues, which was more than compensated for by an 
increase of 67 billion dollars in client-related deposits, reflecting banks' efforts to build up stable 
funding sources, and an increase of 26 billion dollars in repo funding. These major banks were thus 
able to avoid increasing their reliance on relatively expensive funding through the FX swap market. 
Bank Debt and Safe Assets 
One interesting question here is why major Japanese banks were able to pull off such a significant 
change in their balance sheets in such short order. Let me reflect on this from the viewpoint of 
balancing supply and demand of U.S. dollar-denominated financial assets at the macro level. The 
key phrase is "safe assets." 
Financial intermediaries perform an important function of investing in risky assets while issuing 
safe debt. Debt issued by private financial institutions, along with securities issued by governments, 
constitutes safe assets that are provided to the economy. A prime example of such a function is the 
bank  deposit.  Through  the  results  of  recent  research  on  safe  assets,  we  are  now  aware  of  two 
empirical regularities over long periods.5  The first point is that the share of safe assets in the whole 
universe of financial assets including equities is more or less constant. In other words, the demand 
for  safe  debt  has  been  relatively  constant  as  a  fraction  of  the  total  assets  in  the  economy.  The 
second point is that safe debt issued by the government and safe debt issued by private financial 
intermediaries are substitutes. These two regularities indicate that fluctuations in the stock or price 
of government debt crowd in or crowd out safe debt issued by financial intermediaries so that the 
share of safe assets as a whole may be kept constant. 
When we attempt to assess the market conditions regarding safe assets in the U.S. financial system, 
the rise and fall of the "yield spread," which is the difference between the stock yield and long-term 
                                                  
4  Given that foreign currency-denominated balance sheets of Japanese banks are predominantly based on 
U.S. dollars, Chart 7 essentially shows the features of U.S. dollar-denominated balance sheets.

102(3): 101-06.

government bond yield, is quite illuminating (Chart 8). From the early 1990s to the early 2000s, the 
stock yield and the Treasury yield moved almost in tandem and the yield spread remained mostly 
around zero; after that, however, we find persistent and very large spreads. The size of the spread is 
now beyond a level that can be explained by expected growth in corporate earnings or equity risk 
premium.6  Such persistently wide yield spreads indicate that the demand-supply balance of safe 
assets has been much tighter than that of risky assets. An additional demand for safe debt issued by 
the U.S. government has probably resulted from the need for emerging market authorities to invest 
their foreign exchange reserves or from the need to comply with regulations that require financial 
institutions  to  hold  certain  amounts  of  safe  assets.  With  such  increase  in  demand  for  U.S. 
Treasuries,  the  price  of  Treasuries  will  rise  (and  their  yields  will  fall),  and  following  the  recent 
global  financial  crisis,  the  demand  for  safe  assets  from  U.S.  investors  was  fulfilled  by  debt 
instruments  substitutable  for  U.S.  Treasuries  and  issued  by  financial  institutions.  In  particular, 
dollar-denominated  highly  rated  paper  issued  by  non-U.S.  banks,  mainly  from  Canada  and 
Australia, was preferred by U.S. investors.7 
In this environment, the U.S. MMF reform, which I mentioned a few minutes ago, had the effect of 
further increasing demand for U.S. Treasuries.8  As funds shifted from prime MMFs, which invest 
in CP and CDs, to government MMFs, which invest in U.S. government securities, the yield on 
U.S. government securities was pushed down (Chart 9). When Treasury Bill yields fall well below 
LIBOR, which is the benchmark yield for debt instruments issued by private banks, the demand for 
safe  debt  issued  by  banks  will  increase  because  substitutable  Treasury  Bills  become  relatively 
expensive. That is, while prime MMFs have become less attractive as safe assets, an increase in 
demand for U.S. government debt without a concomitant increase in supply could also lead to an 
increase in safe debt issued by financial intermediaries so that the safe asset share may be kept 
constant.  Such  overall  rebalancing  of  the  financial  asset  portfolio  in  the  U.S.  dollar  financial 
market enabled major Japanese banks to adjust the liability side of their balance sheets and focus 
on increasing client-related deposits.

Safe Assets and Financial Vulnerability 
At this point, you might wonder why I am deploying as arcane a concept as safe assets in order to 
explain the changes in the debt composition of Japanese banks. I have done so because the supply 
and demand of safe assets is an important reference point for monitoring and assessing the stability 
and potential vulnerabilities of the financial system. 
Let us look back at the mid-2000s. At that time, as the yield spread suggests, the demand-supply 
balance of U.S. dollar safe assets tightened. In response, U.S. and European investors searching for 
yields  bought  large  amounts  of  highly  rated  asset-backed  securities  issued  by  private  financial 
intermediaries with the perception that these financial instruments were safe but gave yields that 
were  only  a  little  better  than  U.S.  Treasuries.  In  turn,  the  issue  of  asset-backed  securities,  in 
particular  mortgage-backed  securities,  rose  to  meet  increased  demand  from  investors.  We  know 
that  not  everybody  lived  happily  thereafter:  when  problems  surfaced  in  the  U.S.  subprime 
mortgage sector followed by the global financial crisis, the asset-backed securities lost their status 
as  safe  assets.9  Furthermore,  the  increasingly  noticeable  outflow  of  wholesale  deposits  from 
European banks, which aggressively invested in securitized instruments, could be explained at least 
in part by doubts over the appropriateness of regarding certain bank deposits as safe assets. The 
same  mechanism  seems  to  have  been  at  work  when  U.S.  MMFs  reduced  their  exposure  to  CP 
issued by European banks during the European debt crisis beginning in 2011.10 
To  sum  up,  debt  instruments  issued by  private  financial  intermediaries  may  be  regarded  as  safe 
assets substitutable for government securities in tranquil times, but it should be borne in mind that, 
when the going gets rough, those instruments could lose their status as safe assets. With this in 
mind, the Bank of Japan conducted stress tests on foreign currency liquidity risk at Japanese banks 
and published the results thereof in the Financial System Report (most recently in October 2016). 
According  to  those  tests,  even when  the  availability  of foreign  currency  funding  is  impaired,  in 
addition to elevated funding premia for foreign currencies in times of stress, Japanese banks would 
withstand the stress and remain viable. The Bank is also of the view that Japanese banks would be 
able to maintain sufficient levels of capital, which is a sine qua non of their debt instruments being 
                                                  
9  In  addition  to  securitized  instruments  backed  by  residential  mortgages  (RMBSs),  the  period  saw 
substantial  increases  in  the  issuance  of  collateralized  loan  obligations  (CLOs)  backed  by  loans  financing 
leveraged  buyouts  (LBOs),  and  commercial  mortgage-backed  securities  (CMBSs).  In  addition,  it  became 
increasingly  common  to  see  "re-securitized"  instruments  called  asset-backed  securities  collateralized  debt 
obligations (ABS CDOs), which were securitized instruments backed by (primary) securitized products such 
as RMBSs. The price of these instruments, even of highly rated ones, fell significantly after the second half 
of 2007.

regarded as safe assets, even under a tail-event scenario depicting the recent global financial crisis. 
Of  course,  the  Bank  encourages  individual  Japanese  banks  not  to  be  complacent  and  pursue 
enhanced management of liquidity risk, under the assumption that their issued debt is more or less 
"runnable."11 
 V.  Increasing Importance of Non-Banks in the International Financial System 
Up  until  now,  I  have  focused  on  global  financial  intermediation  by  banks,  but  after  the  global 
financial  crisis,  we  cannot  ignore  the  increasing  importance  of  non-banks  in  the  international 
financial system.12  For the next few minutes, let me focus on this development and the effects on 
and implications for Japan through the looking glass of the FX swap market. 
Changes in the Market Structure of Foreign Exchange Swaps 
As  described  earlier,  major  Japanese  banks,  which  can  tap  a  relatively  wide  range  of  funding 
markets,  are  currently  refraining  from  heavily  using  the  FX  swap  market  for  their  U.S.  dollar 
funding (Chart 7). Having said that, statistics for Japanese financial institutions as a whole indicate 
that there are large funding increases in that market (Chart 10). This reflects the increasing demand 
for hedging dollar exposures from financial institutions that have limited funding options compared 
with  major  banks.  Looking  at  the  statistics  on  outstanding  external  securities  investments  by 
financial  institutions,  non-banks  --  such  as  insurers,  pension  funds,  and  investment  trusts  --  are 
increasing their investments as fast as banks (Chart 11). While pension funds are not expected to 
hedge their exposures, life insurers seem to be hedging slightly less than 70 percent of their foreign 
currency exposures in recent years. Investment trusts also seem to hedge their foreign exchange 
risk in response to requests from investors, such as banks or households. 
Against this increased hedging demand, as U.S. banks refrain from engaging in arbitrage trading in 
response to regulatory requirements, we see increasing relative importance of non-banks -- such as 
sovereign  wealth  funds  (SWFs),  reserve  managers  of  emerging  market  economies,  and  private 
investment funds -- as suppliers of U.S. dollars in the FX swap market. The existence of dollar 
funding premia in the swap market signifies an opportunity for suppliers of U.S. dollars to obtain 
yen funding at a very low rate. As a result, overseas non-banks that have dollars to spare can invest

in  Japanese government  securities  (JGSs),  even  if  the  nominal  yields  on  such  paper  are  zero  or 
negative, and secure yields as good as or higher than U.S. government securities without taking on 
foreign exchange risk. The fact that transaction volumes of FX swaps are positively correlated with 
inward  bond  investments  underscores  the  investment  patterns  of  overseas  non-banks  regarding 
FX-hedged investments in JGSs (Chart 12). In an environment where the demand-supply balance 
of dollar safe assets is very tight, FX-hedged investments in JGSs may be viewed by investors as 
safe assets substitutable for U.S. government securities.   
The Swap Market and the Amplification of Procyclicality in Global Liquidity 
One  note  of  caution  here  is  that  FX-hedged  Japanese  government  paper  is  not  always  a  stable 
substitute  for  U.S.  government  paper  just  as  debt  instruments  issued  by  banks.  In  other  words, 
overseas non-banks cannot be regarded as stable sources of U.S. dollar funding. In fact, Japanese 
inward bond investments statistics tend to decline sharply in times of market stress (Chart 12). That 
means  that,  in  times  of  stress,  overseas  non-banks  have  a  tendency  to  reduce  their  FX-hedged 
investments  in  JGSs  and  hence  their  dollar  supply  in  the  FX  swap  market.  For  example,  when 
currencies of emerging market economies started to slide after the Chinese stock market crashed in 
the middle of 2015, market participants talked of emerging market reserve managers, aware of the 
potential  need  to  defend  their  currencies,  refraining  from  offering  dollars  in  the  fixed-term  FX 
swap  market  and  shifting  their  dollars  into  more  liquid  markets  such  as  U.S.  Treasury  Bills.13 
Similar  observations  were  heard  when  currencies  of  emerging  market  economies  weakened 
following the U.S. presidential election in November 2016. In short, while FX-hedged investments 
in  JGSs  are  regarded  as  substitutes  for  U.S.  government  securities  in  tranquil  times,  this  could 
easily break down in times of market stress. 
Turning to SWFs of oil-producing economies, one often hears market talk that, when oil prices fall 
and the country's fiscal position deteriorates, those SWFs tend to reduce their allocation of U.S. 
dollars to the FX swap market, reflecting the reduced availability of investable funds. Staff analysis 
at the Bank of Japan confirms that there is a positive correlation between fluctuations in oil prices 
and transaction volumes in the FX swap market.14 
Such  patterns,  shown  by  overseas  non-banks,  of  supplying  dollar  funds  in  the  FX  swap  market 
could  exacerbate  the  procyclicality  of  international  financial  intermediation  (Chart  13).  For 
                                                  
13  For  example,  see  Arai,  F.,  Y.  Makabe, Y.  Okawara,  and  T.  Nagano,  "Recent  Trends in  Cross-currency 
Basis," Bank of Japan Review, 16-E-7, September 2016. 
14  See Iida et al. (2016) in footnote 2.

example, when emerging market economies are growing strongly, commodity demand would rise, 
leading  to  increases  in  commodity  prices  including  oil.  Emerging  market  currencies  would  also 
appreciate. In such an environment, increases in the assets of SWFs of oil-producing economies 
would see those SWFs allocating some of the increases for investment in the FX swap market. At 
emerging  market  economies,  authorities  would  intervene  to  prevent  the  appreciation  of  their 
currencies, and at least a part of U.S. dollars purchased in those interventions would be invested in 
the FX swap market. Consequently, dollar funding premia in the FX swap market would decline 
and  encourage  non-U.S.  financial  institutions  to  extend  dollar  credit.  If  this  results  in  capital 
inflows  and  increases  in  investment  in  emerging  market  economies,  growth  in  those  economies 
would accelerate. On the other hand, if growth in emerging market economies were to decline for 
one reason or another, the currencies of those economies would depreciate and commodity prices 
would  decline,  reflecting  weaker  demand.  Subsequently,  the  mechanism  I  have  just  described 
would  go  into  reverse  gear.  As  SWFs  of  oil-producing  economies  and  reserve  managers  of 
emerging market economies restrain the supply of dollars in the FX swap market, dollar funding 
premia would rise, non-U.S. financial institutions would cut back on their lending and securities 
investments  in  emerging  market  economies,  and  growth  of  emerging  market  economies 
consequently  would  be  further  adversely  affected.  An  interest  rate  increase  in  the  United  States 
could  amplify  such  procyclicality  in  intermediation  if  such  an  action  brings  about  rapid  and 
large-scale capital outflow from emerging market economies. 
Interdependencies between Non-Banks and Banks 
As  I  noted  at  the  beginning  today,  fluctuations  in  external  credit  extended  by  non-U.S.  banks 
significantly  affected  the  global  economy  (Charts  1  and  2).  It  also  is  a  fact  that,  in  the  past, 
non-banks such as SWFs and emerging market reserve managers had influenced the U.S. dollar 
funding and credit activities of non-US banks.15  For example, dollar deposits at European banks 
were among the preferred destinations of investments by emerging market authorities, who have 
increased their foreign exchange reserves in the 2000s, in view of the lessons learned during their 
currency  crises  of  the  1990s.  Dollar  deposits  of  European  banks  also  enjoyed  inflows  of  SWF 
                                                  
15  The  Latin  American  Debt  Crisis  of  the  early  1980s  was  heavily  influenced  by  international  financial 
intermediation stemming from abundant oil revenues. More specifically, following the two oil crises, a large 
amount of oil revenues flowed into the oil-producing economies, and the money was lent to Latin American 
economies via banks in the developed economies. Meanwhile, during the Japanese bubble economy of the 
late 1980s, Japanese banks increased offshore funding and significantly increased lending through "impact 
loans," which were outside the lending volume restrictions imposed by the Bank of Japan through "window 
guidance." European banks, which were the main lenders to Japanese banks in the offshore market, were 
sourcing a substantial part of their funding from the Middle East. As such, the impact loans were indirectly 
supported by oil revenues.

money,  which  benefited  from  high  oil  prices  until  the  summer  of  2008.  Subsequently,  with  the 
global financial crisis and euro-area debt crisis, such deposits were withdrawn and contributed to 
the deleveraging involving dollar assets at European banks.16 
The  interdependencies  between  non-banks  and  banks  have  a  history  of  procyclically  amplifying 
international  financial  intermediation  in  many  forms.  The  developments  in  the  FX  swap  market 
represent  only  one  manifestation  of  the  interdependencies  between  overseas  non-banks  and 
Japanese  financial  institutions.  In  order  to  maintain  the  stability  of  the  international  financial 
system,  it  is  important  for  the  relevant  authorities  to  always  monitor  and  understand  such 
interdependencies. 
 VI. Final Words 
Let me summarize my key points.   
Non-U.S. financial institutions play a very important role in international financial intermediation, 
which  is  dominantly U.S.  dollar  based.  Monetary  policy  divergence  between  the  U.S.  and  other 
economies is likely to result in an increase of external claims of non-U.S. financial institutions and 
hence  they  would  be  pressed  for  increased  dollar  funding.  Given  that  there  seems  to  be  excess 
demand  for  U.S.  government  securities,  which  are  safe  assets,  the  demand  for  debt  instruments 
issued  by  private  financial  intermediaries,  which  are  substitutes  of  U.S.  government  securities, 
would  increase  in  tranquil  times.  Consequently,  non-U.S.  financial  institutions  would  be  able  to 
increase  their  dollar  funding  without  difficulty.  Meanwhile,  from  the  viewpoint  of  investors 
holding  dollar  funds,  FX-hedged  investments  in  non-U.S.  sovereign  securities  arising  from  FX 
swap  transactions  are  substitutes  of  U.S.  government  securities.  Here  again,  non-U.S.  financial 
institutions would be able to increase dollar funding through the FX swap market, although costs 
could increase. Historically, however, there is evidence that the substitutability of debt instruments 
issued  by  private  financial  intermediaries  and  FX-hedged  investments  in  non-U.S.  sovereign 
securities might be compromised in times of stress, and this could negatively impact dollar funding 
liquidity  at  non-U.S.  financial  institutions.  Considering  that  the  dollar  funding  of  non-U.S. 
financial  institutions  could  be  influenced  by  the  investment  behavior  of  non-banks  --  including 
SWFs, emerging market reserve managers, and investment funds -- we need to be mindful of the

functions," April 2013.

possibility  of  the  behavior  of  banks  and  non-banks  echoing  each  other  under  monetary  policy 
divergence  and  thus  amplifying  fluctuations  in  international  financial  intermediation  and  real 
economic activity. 
In addition, it is important to closely monitor risk-taking activities of non-U.S. financial institutions. 
Under monetary policy divergence, U.S. dollar funding premia in the FX swap market could easily 
spike  higher.  As  such,  the  Bank  of  Japan  would  continue  to  monitor  the  activities  of  Japanese 
banks so as to ensure that they would not, in response to increased funding costs for their dollar 
investments, embark on excessive risk taking in terms of both credit risk and liquidity risk. 
As much as monetary policy divergence itself is a product of central bank policy actions in each 
economy aiming at price stability, it also is the responsibility of central banks to ensure that such 
monetary  policy  actions  would  not  destabilize  the  international  financial  system  through  the 
behaviors of financial institutions. Today, the Japanese financial system remains stable. The Bank 
of  Japan  will  continue  to  encourage  financial  institutions  to  maintain  a  strong  financial  footing, 
which  prevents  risks  from  materializing,  and  also  strengthen  its  monitoring  and  analysis  of 
developments in the international financial system. The Bank, in coordination with other central 
banks, will also enhance schemes to provide foreign currency liquidity to act as a backstop in case 
of  financial  crises.  I  would  like  to  conclude  my  observations  today  by  promising  you  that, 
consistent  with  what  is  in  the  Bank  of  Japan  Act,  the  Bank  will  continue  to  discharge  its 
responsibilities as "Fortress Japan" and maintain financial intermediation functions in Japan. 
Thank you very much for your attention.
