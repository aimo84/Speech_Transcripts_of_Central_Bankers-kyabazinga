13 December 2019
It  is  a  great  pleasure  to  be  here.  The  topic  of  this  session  is  among  the  most 
challenging for central banks today. 
My  contribution  will  be  in  four  parts.  I  shall  start  with  some  observations  on 
monetary  policy  and  financial  spillovers  in  a  financially  interconnected  world, 
before moving on to consider the role of the euro area, followed by the implications 
for the Southern Mediterranean countries. I shall conclude by discussing policy 
implications. 
The debate on monetary and financial spillovers in a financially interconnected 
world 
Global financial integration has been increasing rapidly over the last twenty years. 
Cross-border asset and liability positions have doubled as a share of global GDP 
since the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. The pace of growth has been faster in 
advanced economies (AEs) – partly reflecting the disproportionate rise in the gross 
assets and liabilities of financial centres1 – but it has also been remarkable in emerging 
economies (EMEs), where the average level of gross external assets and liabilities has 
reached 60 per cent of GDP, up from less than 40 per cent in 1997 (Fig. 1).
Greater financial interconnectedness allows for more risk sharing, increasing each 
economy’s ability to absorb idiosyncratic shocks; however, it may also intensify 
the transmission of global shocks, especially those originating from core countries. 
Capital flow volatility and the cross-border correlation of asset price movements and 
credit growth have increased in recent years, in connection with unconventional 
monetary policies put in place in major AEs and with the intensifying search for 
yield. This has revived the debate over the risks posed by international spillovers, 
not only to financial stability but also to monetary policy autonomy, particularly 
in EMEs with less developed domestic financial markets.

The  classical  ‘trilemma’  of  international  macroeconomics  has  been  called  into 
question.  According  to  this  ‘trilemma’,  to  preserve  monetary  autonomy,  more 
open capital accounts require more flexible exchange rates. In a well-known paper 
presented  at  Jackson  Hole  in  2013,  Hélène  Rey  contested  the  validity  of  the 
‘trilemma’.2 She argued that the existence of a global financial cycle, essentially 
driven  by  US  monetary  policy  due  to  the  dominance  of  the  US  dollar  in  the 
international  monetary  and  financial  system,  has  increasingly  undermined  the 
usefulness  of  flexible  exchange  rates  for  insulating  an  economy  from  external 
shocks.  On  the  contrary,  the  financial  implications  of  exchange  rate  changes 
may well dominate their real implications, so that exchange rate movements may 
even exacerbate spillovers (I shall come back to this issue later). According to the 
‘dilemma’ view, the only way out is to resort to the management of capital flows, 
either through explicit controls or by means of macroprudential measures aimed 
at reducing boom and bust cycles of asset prices. 
The debate is still very much alive today; indeed, this was one of the key topics 
at  the  2019  Jackson  Hole  Economic  Symposium.3  The  question  then  is  which 
domestic  policies  and  country  fundamentals  still  matter,  and  how  they  can  be 
used to tame the impact of volatile capital flows. On the one hand, the empirical 
literature has provided some evidence that capital controls, in combination with 
macroprudential regulations, can be effective in reducing the volatility of capital 
flows.4 Furthermore, studies have found that capital inflows tend to be both larger 
and more stable in countries with sounder financial systems and better institutions.5 
On the other hand, recent research,6 including some conducted by staff at the Bank 
of  Italy,7  has  found  that,  in  a  more  financially  interconnected  world,  exchange 
rate  flexibility  helps  in  mitigating  monetary  and  financial  spillovers  to  EMEs, 
but it does not provide full insulation. This is true not only for small countries 
with  weak  economic  fundamentals,  but  also  for  advanced  economies  and  large 
monetary regions.

The euro area: a dual role
Turning to the euro area, let me focus briefly on the international transmission 
mechanism of monetary policy.
Despite being a large economic area, the euro zone is not immune to international 
spillovers. The relative importance of global versus local shocks is increasing as 
globalisation  and  financial  markets’  integration  advances.  US  monetary  policy, 
the  key  driver  of  the  global  financial  cycle,  also  influences  euro-area  financing 
conditions.
At the same time, given that the euro is the second most important currency in 
the international monetary system, the ECB’s monetary policy is itself potentially 
a source of spillovers (Fig. 2). In recent years, extraordinary monetary stimulus 
has  also  been  provided  through  unconventional  monetary  policy  measures; 
international spillovers have been sizeable.
Traditionally,  monetary  policy  is  thought  to  have  cross-border  effects  mainly 
through  the  implied  exchange-rate  movements.  Recent  experience,  however, 
has  shown  that  the  monetary  policy  international  transmission  mechanism 
may  have  several  dimensions.  The  international  environment  is  now  much 
more  deeply  integrated;  portfolio  substitution  by  global  asset  managers  acts 
as  a  powerful  additional  mechanism  for  transmitting  financial  shocks  across 
monetary  areas.  Moreover,  with  policy  rates  close  to  their  effective  lower 
bound  and  the  Eurosystem’s  balance  sheet  greatly  expanded,  the  entire  macro-
financial  environment  has  been  transformed.  Accordingly,  the  theoretical 
framework to study the international transmission of the ECB monetary policy 
stance  has  been  enriched  to  take  into  account  the  role  of  the  increased  global 
integration  of  financial  markets  and  the  distinctive  traits  of  non-standard 
measures. 
Unconventional monetary policy can have significant effects abroad through two 
relatively new channels. The first is the so-called portfolio rebalancing channel of 
asset purchase programs, which is likely to impact financial conditions beyond 
currency area boundaries to the extent that domestic and foreign long-term bonds 
are substitutes. The second channel – the international bank lending channel – 
is  likely  to  be  even  more  important  across  the  Mediterranean.  The  ECB’s 
accommodative monetary measures, especially those aimed at making credit more 
5
abundant, can spur the growth of euro-denominated loans outside the euro area, 
especially in economies with a significant presence of euro-area based banks.
Implications for the Southern Mediterranean countries 
The issue is quite important for Southern Mediterranean countries. In fact, while 
capital controls are still stringent in many of them (Fig. 3), the region has become 
increasingly  integrated  into  global  financial  markets.  Gross  external  financing 
needs have grown fast, with few exceptions, and for some countries lie above the 
emerging and developing countries’ average (Fig. 4).
Capital flows to the Southern Mediterranean countries have been quite resilient 
overall since the global financial crisis and the so called ‘taper-tantrum’ episode 
in 2013 (Fig. 5), helping to finance ‘twin’ (current account and fiscal) deficits in 
those countries (Tab. 1).
However, the more volatile components of capital inflows (portfolio and banking 
flows) have become larger than foreign direct investment (FDI). A sizeable share 
of these inflows has gone to financing the government sector’s large fiscal deficits 
(Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan). At the same time, the reduction of FDI inflows in the 
region may also reflect weak fundamentals (feeble growth prospects and policy 
uncertainty, as well as geopolitical tensions). 
Portfolio  and  banking  flows  are  notoriously  more  volatile  than  FDI  flows,  as 
they are more sensitive to global push factors, such as global risk aversion and 
real interest rates in core countries, exposing recipient countries to sudden stops. 
A recent study conducted by the IMF shows that portfolio inflows to the Middle 
East and North Africa are almost twice as sensitive to changes in global uncertainty 
as those to other countries.8  
Another  worrisome  feature  concerns  the  currency  composition  of  debt  flows. 
Foreign currency debt has expanded rapidly in many countries over the past decade 
(Tab. 2), making the financial channel of the exchange rate especially important. 
For countries with sizeable net foreign currency liabilities, this channel will have

the opposite sign to the traditional trade channel and may more than fully offset 
it (i.e. a devaluation can be contractionary). 
Moreover, for many countries in the region trade integration is primarily with the 
euro area (Tab. 4) while exchange rates are mainly anchored to the US dollar (with 
the  exception  of  Tunisia;  Tab.  5).  This  creates  potential  currency  mismatches, 
especially if export proceeds are mainly euro-denominated while debt obligations 
are in US dollars. 
Policy implications
Given the interdependencies across the Mediterranean countries that I have just 
described  and  the  ongoing  integration  with  the  euro  area,  it  is  natural  to  ask: 
how  should  policies  be  designed  in  order  to  promote  sustainable  capital  flows 
in  the  Mediterranean  area?  The  issue  of  how  to  deal  with  undesired  spillovers 
from policies conducted in the euro area and in the US remains a controversial 
one. I would like to use the remainder of my time to discuss this question from 
three  perspectives:  that  of  the  country  (or  area)  generating  the  spillover  effects 
(‘originating country’), that of the country impacted and, finally, the multilateral 
approach.
Should  the  central  banks  in  originating  countries  internalise  the  spillovers 
of their monetary policy to the rest of the world? The textbook answer to that 
question is that central banks pursue domestically-focused mandates: thus, they 
take into account the adverse effects of volatile capital flows only insofar as they 
negatively affect global financial stability, and through this channel may generate 
spillback effects to their domestic economy. Both conceptually and empirically, 
the measurement of these spillbacks is very challenging as they depend in part on 
the policy response of the countries affected. 
However,  central  banks  can  limit  adverse  monetary  policy  spillovers,  notably 
through  transparency  and  clear  communication  of  their  monetary  policy 
decisions  and  intentions.  The  2013  ‘taper  tantrum’  episode  exemplifies  the 
potentially  destabilising  effects  of  policy  communication  mishaps.  In  addition, 
central banks can contribute to the resilience and soundness of their own financial 
systems with monetary policies designed to support economic activity and with 
macroprudential policies, as well as in their capacity as financial supervisors where 
7
they have such responsibility. This, in turn, contributes to global financial stability, 
with favourable spillovers to the rest of the world.
From  the  perspective  of  the  countries  affected,  the  question  is  how  can 
they  shield  their  economies  and  financial  systems  from  adverse  spillovers? 
Experience  shows  that  having  strong  domestic  fundamentals  and  sound  policy 
frameworks  is  essential.  This  usually  includes  sustainable  budgetary  positions; 
a business environment capable of stimulating investment and attracting FDI; a 
policy framework that ensures effective regulation and supervision of the financial 
sector; and the monitoring of private and public debt in foreign currency. Deep 
and developed domestic financial markets are a necessary condition for building 
up  resilience  to  external  shocks.  The  consensus  nowadays  is  that  exchange  rate  
flexibility  might  help,  but  it  is  no  silver  bullet.  Economies  need  to  have  good 
fundamentals and a comprehensive set of policy tools, including macroprudential 
and capital management measures, to protect themselves adequately from adverse 
spillovers.
Finally,  from  a  multilateral  perspective,  it  seems  that  the  interdependencies 
between  the  policies  of  both  the  originator  and  destination  countries  call  for 
enhanced cooperation. While formal monetary policy coordination would not be 
feasible in view of central bank mandates, there is scope for enhancing multilateral 
efforts to deal with adverse spillovers. Having a platform for the exchange of views 
is  extremely  valuable  in  this  regard.  I  am  thinking  about  this  high-level  policy 
dialogue between the Eurosystem and the Mediterranean countries’ central banks. 
I  believe  that  this  is  the  right  forum  in  which  these  issues  can  be  framed  and 
discussed on a regular basis.
By sharing information and views on the global and domestic economic outlook 
and  on  the  frameworks  within  which  policy  decisions  are  taken,  central  banks 
of the Eurosystem and the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean Countries can 
develop  a  better  understanding  of  the  respective  monetary  policies.  Enhanced 
transparency makes policy actions more predictable  and facilitates discussions on 
the mix of policy options to anticipate and address risks in the countries affected.
