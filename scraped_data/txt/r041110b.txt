Ilmars Rimsevics: The Latvian strategy for the euro transition 
Opening remarks by Mr Ilmars Rimsevics, Governor of the Bank of Latvia, at the Conference “Banking 
and Finance in the Baltics 2004”, Riga, 25 October 2004. 
 Ladies and Gentlemen! 
It is my pleasure indeed to be here today and to address this distinguished audience, to make use of 
this opportunity of sharing views regarding Latvia’s EMU accession! 
For  a  number  of  years  Latvia  has  worked  hard  to  become  a  NATO  member,  to  become  an  EU 
member.  We  have  successfully  put  these  challenges  behind  us.  The  question  now  is  -  what  lies 
ahead? To my mind the most exciting exercise and challenge faced by the Latvian central bank, our 
government and our society in general is the EMU accession project. 
This project has been outlined relatively recently and is being implemented as we speak. It is no less 
demanding,  I  guess,  than achieving NATO  and  EU membership.  Quite  a  lot has  been said  already 
about the budget deficit and overheating of the Latvian economy and I think that the message of the 
central bank has been heard. Therefore I would like to concentrate more specifically this morning on 
how we see the road ahead of us.  
As  you  know,  in  accordance  with  the  EU  legislation  stipulates  that,  by  joining  the  EU,  we  commit 
ourselves to introducing the euro as legal tender in Latvia sooner or later. Latvia undertook to observe 
this legislation with a convincing majority of votes in the 2003 referendum. Hence the question is not 
WHETHER the euro will be introduced in Latvia, the question is WHEN it will happen.  
For  this  process  to  be  as  successful  as  possible,  it  should  be  guided  by  three  basic  principles.  It 
should: 
• 
be easy to understand and transparent - i.e. any person living in Latvia, without doing any 
complicated calculations, must be able to follow how the exchange rate between the lats and 
the euro is set and quickly make sure whether the existing rate has been set correctly ;  
provide  for  equal  treatment  of  all  individuals  and  group  interests  of  enterprises  -  i.e.  no 
social  group  should  gain  advantages  at  the  expense  of  other  groups  as  a  result  of  the 
change of the peg;  
provide  for  stability  -  i.e.  it  must  not  give  rise  to  speculation  and  weaken  the 
macroeconomic stability in the country.  
  The  euro  is  becoming  the  most  frequently  used  currency  in  the  Latvian  foreign  trade  transaction 
(Fig. 2*). The majority of Latvian entrepreneurs also want stronger ties between the Latvian currency 
and the euro (Fig. 3*). With that and the principles just mentioned in mind, the Government and the 
Bank of Latvia have worked together to develop a three-stage strategy for the introduction of the euro 
(Fig. 4.*):  
At the beginning of 2005, the lats is pegged to the euro. Latvia will strive to join the Exchange Rate 
Mechanism (ERM) II soon thereafter.  
• 
In 2007 - spring, at the earliest - the EU institutions give their evaluation of Latvia’s readiness 
to join the euro area  
after receiving a positive evaluation, Latvia would expect to receive an invitation to join the 
EMU. Then, at the beginning of 2008, the introduction of the euro will begin. Let us explore 
each stage in more detail.  
 First - about the first stage that is only a couple of months away. 
That is - about the change of the lats’ peg and the chosen exchange rate level between the lats and 
the euro. We have considered all arguments and summed up all the pluses and minuses.  
As  most  of  you  may  know,  the  Bank  of  Latvia  has  made  a  decision  to  peg  the  lats  to  the  euro  on 
January 1 of 2005 in accordance with the market rate. This market rate would be registered on the 
BIS Review 65/2004 
 1
last business day, December 30, 2004. By pegging the lats to the euro, the Bank of Latvia will neither 
increase nor decrease the value of the lats: it will neither be devalued, nor re-valued.  
Use of SDR formula in setting lats exchange rates  
To  better  understand  the  basis  for  our  decision,  it  might  be  helpful  to  remind  ourselves  of  the 
mechanism whereby the exchange rate between the lats and the euro is set at present. As you know, 
the lats is pegged to the SDR basket of currencies, the IMF unit of settlement - the Bank of Latvia’s 
official exchange rate between the lats and the SDR is 0.7997:1. It has remained unchanged since the 
beginning of the peg in February 1994. 
Taking  into  account  the  exchange  rates  between  the  currencies  in  the  SDR  basket  and  the  fixed 
exchange ratio between the lats and the SDR basket, the official lats’ rate against the other currencies, 
including  the  euro,  is also  determined every  business  day.  Since  the  mutual  exchange  rates  of  the 
principal world currencies, which are all part of the SDR basket - the US dollar, euro, Japanese yen 
and  British pound sterling  -  are constantly,  and  often  significantly,  fluctuating  in  the  global currency 
market,  the  exchange  rate  of  the  lats  against  the  US  dollar,  euro  and  other  currencies  undergoes 
similar fluctuations (Fig. 5.*). Thus, for instance, today’s exchange rate between the lats and the euro 
(0.676  lats  for  one  euro)  has  been  set  as  follows:  on  October  22,  at  about  8:30  a.m.  the  mutual 
exchange  rates  of  the  SDR  basket  currencies  were  registered  and,  applying  the  SDR  formula,  the 
SDR/USD exchange rate was calculated. Since the LVL is pegged to the SDR, it is easy to calculate 
the LVL/USD exchange rate. The LVL/EUR exchange rate is obtained by multiplying the EUR/USD 
exchange rate with the LVL/USD exchange rate.  
The same formula to be used for lats repeg 
This same principle, using the exchange rates on the global market, will be employed when setting the 
lats exchange rate against the other currencies on the last business day of this year, December 30, 
and  this  rate  -  based  on  the  mutual  exchange  rates  of  the  principal  world  currencies  and  the 
relationship between the lats and the SDR basket fixed by the Bank of Latvia - will be the one that will 
apply as the Latvian entrepreneurs and the population at large start their first working day of 2005, 
January 3. The lats exchange rate fluctuations against the other currencies will be determined by the 
fluctuations of the euro exchange rate against these currencies on the global currency markets. Taking 
into account the global fluctuations of exchange rates so far, it is a rather safe prediction that, as of 
next year, the fluctuation band of the lats’ exchange rate against all other currencies, except the euro, 
will widen. For example, if the lats had been pegged to the euro already at the beginning of this year, 
then in the time period between January and October its exchange rate against the US dollar would 
have increased not only by 0.4% as it in fact did (Fig. 6-7*) but by 1.1%. 
More exchange rate fluctuation for currencies other than lats and euro 
Thus an increase in exchange fluctuations is possible for entrepreneurs who conduct important trade 
transactions in currencies other than lats or euros. Every time when discussing the schedule for the 
re-pegging, the central bank has warned that these entrepreneurs should be thinking about ways of 
preventing  the  possible  currency  risk  increases.  To  this  end  -  that  is,  to  give  sufficient  time  for 
preparation both to the entrepreneurs and the banking sector - the date for the currency re-peg was 
chosen:  more  than  a  year  after  the  referendum  on  Latvia’s  accession  to  the  European  Union. 
According  to  the  poll  conducted  by  the  Bank  of  Latvia  of  entrepreneurs  and  bankers,  one  year  is 
enough time for anyone to evaluate, without undue haste and also without needless procrastination, 
the  consequences  of  the  currency  re-peg  on  their  everyday  life  and  to  make  all  the  relevant 
arrangements. 
Joining  ERM  II  will  serve  as  an  additional  stimulus  for  all  the  relevant  state  institutions  to  expend 
maximum effort to ascertain that Latvia fully meets all the requirements in the shortest time possible 
and thus maintains its credibility in the eyes of both the local population and foreigners.

 BIS Review 65/2004
Fluctuation band +/- 1%  
Although the official exchange rate of the lats set by the Bank of Latvia will remain fixed, the interbank 
market  rate,  which  the  banks  use  in  their  mutual  currency  transactions,  will  allow  for  a  certain 
fluctuation  band.  That  will  ensure  successful  functioning  of  the  foreign  exchange  system  without 
continual  interventions  by  the  Bank  of  Latvia.  Although  the  EU  Treaty  provides  for  permissible 
currency fluctuations of +/- 15% of the set central exchange rate within ERM II, the Bank of Latvia is 
planning to one-sidedly limit the lats exchange rate against the euro to +/-1% of the central rate. This 
would have two important advantages.  
• 
First,  the  hitherto  existing  width  of  the  fluctuation  band,  which  has  proved  beneficial  in 
practice, would be maintained.  
Second, maintaining the existing +/-1% fluctuation band around the fixed rate would ensure 
a steady and streamlined transition from one peg to the other.  
 It  is  a  well  known  fact  that  over  the  past  few  years  the  interbank  lats  exchange  rate  has  not  fully 
coincided with the central rate set by the Bank of Latvia, hovering instead around the lower limit of the 
fluctuation band because of the continued high demand for lats. If the situation remains unchanged at 
the moment when the lats is re-pegged to the euro at the end of 2004 and beginning of 2005, then the 
lats interbank rate will also remain closer to the lower limit of the new fluctuation band around the fixed 
lats  exchange  rate  against  the  euro.  That  will  allow  us  to  re-peg  the  lats,  avoiding  sudden  and 
unexpected jerks in the lats exchange rate. In our opinion, it will serve to improve the transparency of 
the process and prevent unnecessary speculations.  
Meeting Maastricht criteria 
After joining ERM II, the next step toward the introduction of the euro will be meeting all the relevant 
Maastricht criteria. We have spoken about them quite a lot.  As we have seen also in the previous 
presentation - the only criterion we are not fulfilling at the moment is inflation. However, we believe 
that there is sufficient time for Latvia to meet it. A year or so ago we were perhaps not thinking that this 
would  be  such  a  difficult  task:  as  you  know  the  inflation  forecast  for  this  year  is  closer  to  7%.  But 
forecast by the Bank of Latvia of inflation for 2005 puts it between 4 and 4.5% and we believe that by 
the time Latvia has to bring its inflation in line with the Maastricht criteria - by the end of 2006 and 
beginning of 2007 - we will be able to fulfil the inflation criterion as well. In fact I am convinced that 
there are no other challenges apart from inflation for us to receive a positive convergence report in 
which  the  European  institutions,  the  European  Commission  and  the  EU  Council,  recognize  Latvia’s 
readiness to join the euro area and introduce the euro. In accordance with the effective EU legislation, 
joining ERM II means that the earliest such a report is received would be the spring of 2007. If this 
report is favourable to Latvia, then, as of 2008, replacing the lats with the euro could begin. Speaking 
about this plan of introducing euro, I should say that it looks realistic. 
The interval between the spring of 2007 and the beginning of 2008 is needed for the entrepreneurs 
and  merchants  to  make  the  preparations  necessary  to  provide  for  a  smooth and  problem-free  euro 
introduction process. We also believe that during this interim period all prices should be quoted both in 
lats and in euros, which would allow the population to get used to the new price structure and prevent 
an unnecessary price hikes.  
However, it is not possible to quote the prices in both lats and euros before a positive convergence 
report has been received and Latvia is invited to become a full-fledged EMU member. 
The government euro plan in a nutshell 
This  is  what  the  Latvian  Government  strategy  for  euro  introduction  of  euro  looks  like  in  a  nutshell, 
developed jointly by the Finance ministry and the central bank. It is our opinion that only a consistent 
and  sequential  implementation  of  the  steps  I  have  just  outlined  constitutes  the  optimum  strategy 
meeting  the  relevant  requirements:  it  is  transparent,  economically  sound  and  understandable,  it 
prevents discrimination and any, even theoretical, possibility of speculation.  We believe that any other 
option would be a violation of the principles of transparency, equal access or stability and therefore 
would not be optimal.

Another scenario that has been often suggested in relation to the re-peg envisions pegging the lats to 
the  euro  not  in  accordance  to  the  market  rate  of  the  given  day  but  on  the  basis  of  the  average 
exchange rate of the entire year 2004. This scenario is based on the argument that on the last days of 
any year there are always increased fluctuations on the currency markets. First, I should point out that 
data at our disposal seem to indicate that this is not quite the case (Fig. 8*). Second, such a solution 
would violate the requirement that the re-peg be transparent: it would be very hard or even impossible 
to justify choosing the average exchange rate of the last 12 months over, say the last six or sixteen. 
Moreover,  given  the  exchange  rate  dynamics  between  the  lats  and  the  euro  this  year,  it  is  quite 
possible that the existing market rate would only differ from the average rate for the whole year for less 
than one santims (a few base points) (Fig. 9*). It is highly doubtful that correcting the exchange rate in 
this  small  amount  would  have  a  serious  effect  on  the  economic  processes.  At  the  same  time, 
implementing  this  scenario  would  set  a  needless  precedent  of  the  exchange  rate  of  the  lats 
undergoing desultory changes as soon as it has been re-pegged. That would be in direct contradiction 
to the objective of stability and predictability and would give rise to needless speculations. Therefore 
we believe that implementing this scenario would also be less than feasible. 
To recapitulate, I would like to stress once more that since Latvia’s accession to the European Union 
one of the main tasks shared by the Bank of Latvia and other state institutions is to ensure that Latvia 
join the euro area in a timely and balanced manner and to replace the lats with the euro. The currently 
adopted  euro  introduction  strategy  envisions  that  under  successful  cooperation  between  the 
Government, the Bank of Latvia and commercial banks, Latvia will be able to meet all relevant criteria 
and  begin  introducing  the  euro  as  of  2008.  I  can  assure  you  that,  as  far  as  the  Bank  of  Latvia  is 
concerned, we will spare no effort to ensure that this process in all its stages is as peaceful and even, 
and successful as possible.
