Durmuş Yilmaz: Inflation in Turkey – an overview 
Speech by Mr Durmuş Yilmaz, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at the press 
conference for the presentation of the Inflation Report, Ankara, 28 April 2006. 
 Dear Press Members, Distinguished Guests, 
The second issue of the Inflation Report, the leading communication means of the Inflation Targeting 
regime,  which  was  put  into  effect  as  of  January  2006,  has  been  published  on  the  web  site  of  the 
Central Bank of Turkey today.  
As repeatedly emphasized in our previous presentations and press releases, the impacts of monetary 
policy decisions on the economy manifest themselves during a certain period. In this context, on the 
way to achieve pre-announced inflation targets, central banks should analyze the developments that 
will  affect  the  medium-term  tendency  of  inflation  and  release  inflation  forecasts  based  on  these 
analyses  at  certain  periods  within  the  framework  of  the  inflation  targeting  regime.  In  the  event  of  a 
remarkable deviation from the promulgated forecasts, explaining the reasons for such a deviation and 
the policy measures that should be taken to general public via inflation reports is of special importance 
under the transparency and accountability principles.  
In  this  framework,  the  Central  Bank  published  its  first  Inflation  Report,  which  includes  inflation 
forecasts  and  the  analyses  related  to  the  economic  outlook  that  lies  behind  the  said  forecasts  in 
January 2006. With this report, the Central Bank, has, at the same time, shared with the public how it 
interprets the economic outlook with respect to inflation and monetary policy.  
In  this  context,  the  second  issue  of  the  Inflation  Report  evaluates  general  macroeconomic 
developments so as to shed light on the likely tendency of inflation in the medium-term and, compare 
and contrast the updated assumptions on macroeconomic variables with those of the previous Inflation 
Report. The forecasts produced on the basis of the said assumptions are also shared with the public. 
In addition to all of this, the likely risks that may lead to an apparent downward or upward deviation in 
inflation forecasts are also explicated in the Report.  
Content of the Inflation Report 
Distinguished Guests, 
The Inflation Report consists of six chapters.  
In the first chapter, macroeconomic developments are summarized in the light of data released in the 
first  quarter  of  2006.  The  outlook  for  the  supply-demand  balance,  productivity  developments, 
international liquidity conditions and the risk premium, which are the determinants of the tendency of 
inflation in the medium-term and the inflation forecasts produced in compliance with this outlook also 
appear in the first chapter. Since it is considered that the control horizon of monetary policy involves a 
timeframe of one and a half years as in the previous Inflation Report, forecasts are presented so as to 
cover the remaining three quarters of 2006 and the first three quarters of 2007.  
Moreover,  the  outlook  regarding  the  course  of  the  factors  that  pose  risk  to  achieving  the  inflation 
target,  which  are  outside  the  area  of  impact  of  monetary  policy  is  summarized  in  the  introduction 
section and the likely policy reaction against such risks is discussed. These risk factors are listed as 
the course of oil prices, housing price increases, the acceleration in price increases of those items, 
which are determinant in the inflation of the goods group, such as fresh fruits, oil, basic metals and 
gold, global risk appetite and international liquidity conditions.  
Detailed analyses of developments in inflation, supply-demand, the financial sector and public finance, 
which  have  been  examined  within  the  framework  of  the  information  they  contain  relating  to  the 
medium-term tendency of inflation are presented in the following four chapters.  
In  the  last  chapter  of  the  Inflation  Report,  updated  assumptions  on  fundamental  macroeconomic 
variables  are  compared  and  contrasted  with  the  assumptions  of  the  previous  Inflation  Report  and 
inflation  and  the  output  gap  forecasts  produced  on  the  basis  of  these  assumptions  are  analyzed. 
BIS Review 67/2006

Furthermore, the likely risks that may lead to an apparent upward or downward deviation in inflation 
forecasts are explicated in detail.  
In  this  Inflation  Report,  a  number  of  boxes  have  been  prepared  in  order  to  shed  light  on  certain 
subjects of interest as in the previous Report. For instance, the impacts of differentiation in productivity 
ratios in the tradable and non-tradable sectors compared to the Euro zone on relative prices and real 
exchange rate behavior in the process of convergence with the European Union are analyzed in one 
of the boxes. Moreover, in addition to the box in which international gold prices and the impacts of 
these on the CPI are analyzed, the Report also contains a box in which the targets and realizations 
relating  to  inflation  and  Net  International  Reserves  are  evaluated  within  the  context  of  IMF 
conditionality.  
Distinguished Guests, 
After this general overview, I would like to summarize the evaluations and the inflation forecasts of the 
Central Bank in the latest Report, which will be published on our web site today. 
Inflation developments 
In  the  first  quarter  of  2006,  the  fall  in  inflation  displayed  a  slowdown  tendency  in  line  with  our 
predictions in the previous Inflation Report and the annual rate of increase in consumer prices was 
realized  as  8.16  percent  as  of  the  end  of  March  2006.  This  slowdown  stems  from  the  base  effect 
created by the price increases that have realized at historically very low levels due to the reduction in 
the Value Added Tax (VAT) rates of food, health and education items made in early 2005 (Graph 1).

However, the sole reason for the realization of inflation above the path consistent with the end year 
inflation target in the first quarter of the year is not the said base effect. When the contribution of sub-
items to first quarter inflation is analyzed, it is observed that the course of prices of unprocessed food 
products, which increased beyond expectations, tobacco products and services played a leading role 
in  the  said  rise.  Nevertheless,  high-rated  seasonal  discounts  in  clothing  prices  due  to  demand  and 
competitive conditions limited the increase in consumer price inflation (Graph 2).

Dear Guests, 
Classifying goods and services group, price increases in goods group gained pace, while the services 
group inflation declined, except rents item, in the first quarter of 2006.  
Along with energy prices, the prices of unprocessed food products, which increased significantly in the 
first quarter of 2006, compared to the same period of the previous period, became the determinant in 
the rise in prices of the goods group (Graph 3).

 The developments in services group prices indicate that the prices in restaurant and hotel services as 
well as transportation prices remained considerably below the rates of increase of the same period of 
the  previous  year.  Nevertheless,  annual  inflation  rates  in  services,  which  are  referred  to  as  ‘labor 
BIS Review 67/2006

intensive services’ and whose prices cannot be directly managed and are not directly influenced by 
energy  prices,  have  followed  a  stable  course  in  the  past  year.  Moreover,  the  realization  of  price 
increases in rents at almost the same rates of the previous year due to the lack of immediate housing 
supply against increasing housing demand in the first quarter of 2006 also points to the unfavorable 
impact  of  the  said  prices  on  consumer  prices  throughout  the  year.  In  this  context,  demand 
developments towards services and productivity developments are being carefully monitored and we 
maintain our scrutiny of these developments (Graph 4).

Analyzing  the  course  of  prices  in  durable  consumption  goods,  excluding  gold  prices,  that  have 
continued  their  high-rated  upward  trend  within  the  framework  of  developments  in  international 
markets, the annual rate of increase of the said prices entered a downward trend as of August and this 
trend continued to accelerate in the first quarter of 2006. A reverse in the tendencies of both furniture 
prices,  which  may  be  an  indicator  of  consumption  demand  and  prices  in  the  electrical  and  non-
electrical devices group, including technology-intensive goods open to competitiveness in general and 
susceptible to the exchange rate developments as well, are major determinants of this trend (Graph 
5).

Considering  the  fact  that  seasonal  price  movements  are  determinant  in  consumer  prices,  it  will  be 
helpful to analyze the Special CPI Aggregates (SCA), excluding seasonal products, with respect to the 
course of inflation.  
The decline in the annual rate of increases in the SCA-E* index that has been continuing since the 
beginning  of  2005,  which  is  calculated  by  excluding  seasonal  products  from  the  SCA-E  index  - 
excluding energy, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, had slowed down by the first quarter of 
2006. On the other hand, it is observed that the downward trend in the seasonally adjusted SCA–D* 
index,  which  is  calculated  by  excluding  energy,  unprocessed  food,  alcoholic  beverages,  tobacco 
products and gold, continued in the first quarter of the year as well and the main trend of inflation was 
downwards (Graph 6).

Producer prices rose by 2.48 percent in the first quarter of 2006. The Producer Prices Index, which is 
calculated by excluding tax, indicates that manufacturing industry prices, comprising a significant part 
of the index, have become more susceptible to raw material prices and exchange rate developments 
compared to previous years (Graph 7).

The sector, in which the said effect is clearly perceived within the PPI, is the petroleum products sector 
that is subject to high taxes. Excluding the said effect, the annual rate of increase in manufacturing 
industry prices is maintaining its low-level trend, albeit its slight upward tendency (Graph 8).

Distinguished Guests, 
Inflation  expectations  are  determinant  on  inflation  realizations  in  view  of  being  the  basis  for  both 
pricing  behavior  and  wage  adjustments.  Therefore  the  developments  in  these  expectations  play  an 
important  role  in  Central  Bank  analyses  and  evaluations.  In  this  framework,  analyzing  the  inflation 
expectations for the next 12 months and 24 months as of April, the following points emerge:  
Though consumer inflation expectations for the next twelve months have declined, the rate of decline 
has  been  slowing  down  significantly  since  February  and  expectations  have  to  some  extent  been

 BIS Review 67/2006
following a horizontal course. The fact that long-term consumer expectations relating to the next 12 
and 24 months are slightly above the targets is interpreted as a development that requires prudence 
with respect to the falling inflation process. Nevertheless, the course of longer-term expectations at 
low levels is an encouraging development as regards the success of inflation targeting (Graph 9).

Supply and demand developments 
Supply-demand balance 
Distinguished Guests, 
At this point, I would like to touch on our evaluations relating to supply and demand developments in 
the light of national income data released at the end of March. 
In the last quarter of 2005, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 9.5 percent compared to the 
same period of the previous year. Hence, GDP growth was realized as 7.4 percent throughout 2005. 
The  ongoing  structural  reform  process  along  with  the  implementation  of  tight  monetary  and  fiscal 
policies have enabled the strengthening of economic fundamentals, characterized as a decline in the 
risk premium, reduction in real interest rates and appreciation of the New Turkish lira (YTL) against 
foreign  currencies,  which  have  been  the  main  determinants  of  rapid  growth  in  the  total  domestic 
demand in 2005. Within this framework, total final domestic demand increased by the high rate of 19.1 
percent in the last quarter of 2005 compared to the same period of the previous year. Analyzing by 
quarterly  periods,  seasonally  adjusted  data  also  point  to  an  ongoing  rapid  growth  tendency  in  total 
final domestic demand in the last quarter of 2005 (Graph 10).

Analyzing by demand components, total consumption and total investment expenditures made a high 
contribution to GDP growth by 5.8 and 5.7 percentage points, respectively. While private investment 
expenditures maintained both its machinery-equipment and construction investment-originated growth 
trend  in  the  last  quarter  of  the  year,  public  expenditures  provided  an  investment-based  support  to 
economic growth during the same period. Accordingly, both public and private-sector-originated high 
increases in total investment expenditures are still continuing (Graph 11). The index produced by the 
aggregation  of  indicators  relating  to  investments  also  points  to  an  ongoing  upsurge  in  machinery-
equipment  investments  (Graph  12).  Moreover,  the  high-rated  increase  in  long-term  credit  use  from 
abroad  during  the  January-February  period  compared  to  the  same  period  of  the  previous  year 
indicates that investment-originated growth prevailed in the first quarter of 2006 as well (Annex Graph 
1).

 BIS Review 67/2006
Despite rapid growth in the total final domestic demand and the GDP, the current production tendency 
signifies  a  level  that  does  not  impose any  pressure  on  prices.  Hence,  estimates  for  the  output  gap 
indicate that recent trend in economic growth does not pose a threat with respect to inflation (Graph 
13).  The  factors  underlying  this  evaluation  can  be  listed  as  follows:  (i)  Analyzing  the  supply-side 
sources of growth, continuance of productivity gains, which is a key element of non-inflationary growth, 
enables the reduction in unit labor costs, thus restricts the impact of the rises in other costs. (ii) The 
demand-side sources of growth points to an increasing share of investments in the GDP. The ongoing 
strong growth trend in investment expenditures limits inflationary pressures through its support for the 
increases in partial labor productivity via capital deepening. Accordingly, the composition of domestic 
demand  secures  the  simultaneous  achievement  of  rapid  growth  and  disinflation.  (iii)  Although  the 
strong  position  of  the  YTL  against  foreign  currencies  is  a  factor  that  supports  domestic  demand 
growth, it restricts the impact of rapid growth on prices not only by its direct effect on prices but also by 
stimulating investment demand, which in turn induces productivity gains.

Despite  the  fact  that  the  recent  data  provide  signals  for  an  ongoing  strong  course  of  domestic 
demand, within the framework of non-inflationary rapid growth analysis explained above, the output 
gap is expected to support the disinflation process in the first half of 2006 as well. Nevertheless, our 
view that the contribution of supply-demand conditions to the disinflation process has diminished is still 
valid.

The current account, which was USD 15.6 billion in 2004, reached USD 23.1 billion in 2005, realizing 
6.4 percent of the GNP (Graph 14). The upward trend in the current account deficit continued in the 
first two months of 2006.

In 2005, while the rates of increase of both exports and imports weakened compared to 2004, the rate 
of increase in exports remained well below the rate of increase in imports in the second half of the 
year. The said tendency continued in the first two months of 2006 as well (Graph 15). The decline in 
textiles  and  apparels  exports  on  an  annual  basis  since  November  2005  has  had  an  unfavorable 
impact  on  general  export  performance.  While  rapid  economic  growth  leads  to  an  increase  in  the 
imports of intermediary goods, the rises in oil prices boost the amount of imports infused terms.

 BIS Review 67/2006
It is expected that the current account deficit will not pose any risk with respect to economic stability 
and the inflation target in the short-term. Along with growth in the share of foreign direct investments 
that have gained pace with privatization revenues, the increase in the share of long-term credits in the 
credit composition of the banking sector and the private sector eases concerns about the sustainability 
of the current account. It is predicted that foreign direct investments, which reached USD 8.6 billion in 
2005  (2.4  percent  of  GDP),  will  prevail  at  high  levels  in  2006  as  well  due  to  the  continuance  of 
privatization  revenues  and  company  acquisitions.  Moreover,  the  process  of  convergence  with  the 
European Union is expected to ensure the continuance of international capital’s interest in Turkey. 
Costs 
While productivity rose at a high rate in the private manufacturing industry, real unit wages dropped by 
8.2 percent compared to the same period of the previous year due to the decline in real wages (Graph 
16).  The  persistence  of  the  drop  in  real  unit  wages  became  one  of  the  leading  factors  in  the 
continuation of the disinflation process.

In  2006,  in  the  event  investments  and  employment  in  the  manufacturing  industry  follow  the  same 
course as the previous period, the continuance of productivity increases may be expected. Meanwhile, 
the salaries of civil servants and minimum wage increases point to a rise in wages above inflation.  
The unfavorable course in raw material prices, another significant component of costs, still persists. 
Crude oil prices exceeded their historical peak figure experienced during Hurricane Katrina by the 25th 
of  April  and  reached  USD  73.3  per  barrel.  OPEC’s  decision  to  leave  its  quota  unchanged  at  its 
meeting  of  the  8th  of  March,  the  low  level  of  unused  capacity  in  the  sector  and  uncertainties  about 
leading oil producing countries such as Nigeria and Iran led to an increase in oil prices. Despite new 
production  capacities  are  expected  to  be  introduced,  the  International  Energy  Agency’s  (IEA) 
expectations for the growth trend in crude oil demand, which are above those of 2005, strengthen the 
probability  that  oil  prices  will  remain  high  throughout  2006.  In  the  meantime,  while  the  high  global 
growth tendency pushes metal prices upwards, the increase in the interest of investment funds to the 
sector investment tools becomes the determinant in the upsurge in metal prices above expectations. 
In the light of these developments, crude oil prices continue to be a risk factor with respect to inflation.

Distinguished Guests, 
The course of international liquidity conditions and the risk premium in the first two months of the year 
has been in favor of developing countries. In March, the favorable course in risk premium came to a 
halt  because  of  the  deterioration  in  the  global  risk  appetite  and  the  increase  in  the  perceptions  of 
uncertainty  about  the  interest  rates  of  the  Bank  of  Japan.  Nevertheless,  the  ongoing  successful 
conduct of budget performance became the most significant development that limited the tendency of 
deterioration in expectations (Graph 18).

The benchmark interest rate in the ISE, which has been realized under the overnight borrowing rate 
since  October  2005,  displayed  a  slight  increase  in  March  due  to  the  stagnation  in  interest  rate

Analyzing the yield curve that shows interest rates in the ISE with different maturities, the interest rates 
have been realized at a lower level in each maturity as of 24 April 2006 compared to the end of the 
previous year. This development stems from the expectations that the downward tendency in inflation 
will continue in 2006 as well. Nevertheless, the more horizontal course of the longer maturity end of 
the yield curves compared to the previous periods confirms the cautious attitude of economic agents 
towards their future risk perceptions in the said period (Graph 20).

It  is  observed  that  the  stability  in  YTL-denominated  bond  issues  by  foreign  banks,  an  indicator  of 
demand for YTL, has a tendency to continue. In the first quarter of 2006, there was no remarkable 
change in the maturity structure of current securities compared to the last quarter of the previous year 
(Graph 23).

Year of Maturity

Distinguished Participants, 
It is well known that developments in debt stock are of great importance with respect to managing the 
expectations of economic agents and, thus, the course of the risk premium. In this framework, these 
developments are closely monitored as regards monetary policy and inflation.  
In the current period, the rate of increase in the debt stock slowed down significantly due to decreasing 
interest payments and the high primary surplus and the downward tendency in the ratio of public debt 
stock  to  GNP  continued.  It  is  observed  that  the  same  trend  still  continues  even  when  parity  and 
exchange rate effects are excluded from the change in debt stock.  
Additionally, it is considered that the structure of debt stock has become stronger against the risks in 
the  said  period.  Decreasing  the  susceptibility  of  debt  stock  towards  exchange  rates  and  limiting  its 
susceptibility  to  interest  rates  on  one  hand,  and  the  risk  reduction  in  debt  roll-over  owing  to  the 
extension of the borrowing maturity and the strengthening of cash reserves on the other hand, are the 
factors that support our mentioned assessment (Graph 24).

Medium-term forecasts 
Current stance, short-term outlook and the assumptions  
Current stance relating to real sector variables that constitute the basis for the forecasts presented in 
the  previous  Inflation  Report  have  been  preserved  in  this  Report  to  a  great  extent.  Despite  rapid 
growth in domestic demand in the last quarter of 2005, the ongoing increase in the ratio of investment 
expenditures to GDP eased the pressures on inflation imposed by the increase in demand by pushing 
the production capacity upwards. Moreover, continuing productivity  proceeds limited the increase in 
costs, thus limiting the pressure on inflation. While producing forecasts, the short-term outlook relating 
to domestic supply and demand conditions was developed in the light of these findings.  
Real  interest  and  real  exchange  rate  variables,  which  determine  the  relationship  of  supply-demand 
conditions to inflation and constitute the starting point of the monetary transmission mechanism, are 
also significant components of the assumption set that constitute the basis for medium-term forecasts. 
It is assumed that in the current situation, real interest rates are not at a level that can exert pressure 
on credit increases and demand conditions. Nevertheless, under a main scenario in which the current 
program  will  continue  to  be  implemented,  macro  and  political  stability  will  not  deteriorate,  structural 
reforms and, accordingly, long-term capital inflows as well as productivity increases will continue, it is 
assumed that the New Turkish lira will retain its strong position and will continue to support the decline 
in inflation.  
In the first Inflation Report of 2006, it was foreseen that though the falling inflation process would enter 
a  stagnation  period  in  the  first  quarter  of  the  year,  it  would  follow  a  downward  tendency  as  of  the 
second  quarter  of  the  year,  unless  an  unfavorable  exogenous  development  happened.  While  the 
16 
 BIS Review 67/2006
reduction of VAT in the textile, ready-made clothing and leather sectors to 8 percent from 18 percent in 
March  was  a  development  that  reinforced  the  forecast  that  inflation  would  re-enter  a  downward 
tendency  in  the  second  quarter  of  the  year,  rapid  increases  in  oil  prices  in  the  recent  period 
forewarned  that  the  said  forecast  should  be  handled  cautiously.  While  producing  forecasts,  this 
information was also added in the framework of the short-term outlook. 
Besides, the price dynamics in services sector, mainly the rent sub-item, continue to play a critical role 
with respect to achieving the year-end inflation target. Though the contribution of the rises in the rent 
sub-item  to  2006  inflation  is  forecasted  to  be  about  one  point,  a  scenario,  in  which  this  periodic 
pressure on CPI inflation will decreasingly persist throughout 2007, is considered. 
Forecasts relating to fundamental macro variables of the Euro zone, such as interest rates, inflation 
and  growth,  analyses  concerning  international  commodity  prices  and  the  likely  course  of  global 
liquidity  conditions  comprise  our  assumptions  of  the  external  world  that  constitute  the  basis  for  our 
forecasts.  European  growth  figures  were  slightly  revised  upwards  within  the  framework  of  the 
“Consensus  Forecast”  results  and  the  assumption  that  European  Union  Harmonized  CPI  inflation 
would almost reach the targeted two percent in 2006 and 2007 was retained. Moreover, the news that 
the European Central Bank would presumably continue to raise interest rates was considered while 
producing  our  inflation  forecasts.  Along  with  those  of  the  Euro  zone,  monetary  policies  of  other 
developed  countries  were  also  carefully  monitored  during  the  forecast-making  process  as  regards 
foreseeing the course of international liquidity conditions. 
Following a relative stable course, crude oil prices entered an upward trend in the last period. Due to 
the difficulty in making a precise forecast relating to oil prices, while producing inflation forecasts under 
the main scenario, it was assumed that oil prices would follow a horizontal course at their current level. 
Hence,  a  level  above  that  assumed  in  the  first  Inflation  Report  was  foreseen.  In  this  context,  the 
assumptions about oil prices were updated upwards while producing forecasts.  
Finally, a number of assumptions were made on the likely course of the risk premium throughout 2006 
and  2007.  The  favorable  outlook  for  the  course  of  the  risk  premium  specified  in  the  first  Inflation 
Report was preserved for the first two months of 2006. However, both the deterioration tendency in the 
global risk appetite and the increase in the uncertainty perceptions about the Bank of Japan’s liquidity 
policy led to a rise in the risk premium in March. Nevertheless, in line with the easing of uncertainty 
perceptions during the last period, the forecasts given in the last chapter of the Report are based on 
the projections that the change in global liquidity will be moderately realized and international liquidity 
conditions will not experience any sudden changes. 
Interpretation of forecasts 
Distinguished Guests, 
As I emphasized in the introduction to my speech, it takes a certain period of time for the monetary 
policy decisions to manifest their effect on the economy. Taking this fact into consideration, the Central 
Bank  establishes  its  monetary  policy  under  a  medium-term  perspective  and  focuses  on  the 
consistency of future inflation with the target, not that of today’s inflation. In this framework, since it is 
considered that the average control horizon of monetary policy on the economy involves a period of 
time of one and a half-years, the forecasts are presented so as to include the remaining three quarters 
of 2006 and the first three quarters of 2007.

*The probability of inflation staying within the forecast range is 70 percent.

♦ The path consistent with the 2007 end-year target, under contemporary data set. 
 
The inflation forecasts given in Graph 25 were made under the base scenario developed on the basis 
of the assumptions and short-term outlook mentioned above, and the stance under which the Central 
Bank  will  progressively  cut  its  policy  interest  rates  in  the  forthcoming  period.  Accordingly,  it  is 
forecasted, in the light of current information, that inflation will be realized between the 4.8-6.4 percent 
at the end of 2006 and between the 2.9-5.4 percent at the end of the first nine months of 2007. In 
other words, according to the forecasts that have been produced within the framework of today’s data 
set, inflation will regain a downward course starting from the second quarter of the year. This tendency 
will become more apparent as of the third quarter and year-end inflation will be realized close to the 
target (Graph 25). 
The Graph also displays forecasts on the output gap that constitute the basis for the inflation forecast. 
Accordingly,  the  output  gap  will  continue  to  remain  negative  throughout  2006.  In  other  words,  the 
contribution of overall demand and capacity conditions to the falling inflation process will continue in 
2006 as well, albeit with a decline compared to the previous years. The projection that total demand 
for domestic goods will remain relatively limited due to the negative contribution of the foreign demand, 
despite the stable increase in domestic final demand throughout 2006, underlies these findings (Graph 
25).

In Graph 26, the forecasts that have been produced under a main scenario are presented - in which 
the current stance, the short-term outlook and the assumptions relating to the fundamental variables - 
the framework of which are given above -are faithfully preserved; however, the policy interest rates are 
maintained as unchanged for one year starting from today. 
In contrast to the previous scenario, the path of policy interest rates has not been determined by a 
medium-term  approach,  but  has  been  handled  as  an  exogenous  assumption.  Under  the  said 
assumption, output gap becomes clearly negative as of the third quarter of 2006 and the contribution 
of demand conditions to falling inflation increases. According to the projections produced under such 
conditions, inflation drops rapidly compared to the previous scenario and is realized between a 1.9 - 
4.5 percent by the third quarter of 2007. Thus, the possibility of inflation falling evidently under the path 
consistent with the target increases (Graph 26). 
Risk elements 
Distinguished Participants, 
It should be emphasized once more that the forecasts that I have presented were produced under a 
main  scenario,  which  was  developed  on  the  basis  of  the  above-mentioned  assumptions  and  short-
term outlook in the light of current data. In the event of a possible threat to the medium-term inflation 
outlook by risk elements, the Central Bank will review both its forecasts and the stance of monetary 
policy towards the future.  
Distinguished Guests,  
In the final part of my speech, I would like to touch on the risks in question. 
Uncertainties  about  the  course  of  oil  prices  are  the  leading  risk  element  with  respect  to  the 
achievement  of  the  inflation  target  in  the  coming  period.  In  the  forecasts  produced  in  the  previous 
Inflation  Report,  oil  prices  were  assumed  unchanged.  However,  these  prices  persisted  to  rise 
throughout this period and reached high levels in recent times. The unfavorable impact of oil prices on 
BIS Review 67/2006 
 19
annual inflation became one of the factors that slowed down the decline in inflation expectations in the 
first quarter of 2006. If this tendency persists in the coming months, the impact of oil prices on the 
2006 end-year inflation will start to be felt. The effect of oil price increases has not yet gone beyond 
the relative price changes and has not led to pricing change in the sectors that do not utilize petroleum 
products  as  direct  input.  In  other  words,  the  secondary  effects  remained  at  a  limited  level. 
Nevertheless, expectations have adopted a position that requires more careful monitoring compared 
the previous quarter. At this point, it should be underlined once more that the CBRT would provide the 
necessary  response,  if  the  increases  in  oil  prices  persist  and  the  secondary  effects  manifest 
themselves. 
Another factor that leads to a slowdown in the disinflation process is unusual price increases in some 
items,  such as  rent,  due to  the  persistence  of  the  supply  gap  in the  housing sector.  Services  price 
increases,  especially  rent-originated  price  increases  in  the  services  sector,  are  expected  to  realize 
significantly  above  the  general  inflation  tendency  throughout  2006.  It  is  considered  that  this 
development has resulted mainly from the structural factors specific to the transition period and will 
continue for a certain period of time. But it is also believed that at this stage it does not require any 
monetary policy response. It is predicted that this situation will gradually be back to normal with the 
harmonization of housing supply. 
The contribution of the increase in the services group to 2006 inflation is forecasted to be around 2.3-3 
points. Accordingly, the goods group inflation should be realized at about 3 percent in order to achieve 
the 2006 target. However, the acceleration in price increases in the items that is not under the control 
of  the  monetary  policy,  such  as  fresh  fruits  and  vegetables,  oil,  basic  metal  and  gold,  reduces  this 
possibility. At this point, it is meticulously emphasized that price increases in the said items are to a 
large extent temporary and that monetary policy will not react strongly as far as the secondary effects 
remain limited. 
Another basic risk relating to the upcoming period is the difficulty in foreseeing the global risk appetite 
and the course of international liquidity conditions. The improvement in the quality of current account 
financing and favorable developments in public finance in the recent period are considered to increase 
the  endurance  of  the  economy  against  likely  shocks.  However,  it  is  a  fact  that  any  shock  that  may 
come from the said direction in the current situation carries with it the potential to affect our economy 
unfavorably. In case of such an event, our aim will be to ensure the consistency of inflation with the 
medium-term  targets.  In  this  context,  by  diffusing  the  policy  reaction  over  time,  the  impact  of 
exogenous shocks will be eased without any harm to price stability. 
Distinguished Guests, 
Price stability is a sine qua non precondition with respect to macroeconomic stability and sustainable 
growth. Significant steps have been taken in this direction. The CBRT will continue to fulfill its tasks in 
carrying  these  achievements  forward.  It  should  be  kept  in  mind  that  the  main  factor,  which  is 
determinant  in  the  sustainability  of  non-inflationary  growth,  is  the  confidence  in  the  permanency  of 
macroeconomic  stability.  In  this  context,  along  with  the  ongoing  determination  regarding  structural 
regulations  that  improve  the  quality  of  fiscal  discipline,  the  continuity  of  reforms  that  will  develop 
competition and investment environment, thus supporting productivity increases in the long term, is of 
critical importance. 
Thank you.
