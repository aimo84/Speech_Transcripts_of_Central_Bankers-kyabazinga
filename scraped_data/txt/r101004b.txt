José De Gregorio: Monetary Policy Report 
Presentation  by  Mr  José  De  Gregorio,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  before  the 
Honorable Senate of the Republic, Santiago, 8 September 2010. 
 Introduction 
Mr.  President  of  the  Senate,  senator  Jorge  Pizarro,  ladies  and  gentlemen  senators,  I  am 
grateful for the invitation to the Board of the Central Bank of Chile to present our Monetary 
Policy  Report.  Like  every  year  in  September,  this  presentation  coincides  with  the  yearly 
report given by the Board of the Central Bank to the Senate, where we expose our vision of 
recent  macroeconomic  and  financial  developments  in  the  Chilean  economy,  as  well  as  its 
prospects and implications for the conduct of monetary policy.  
In a few days we will be celebrating our country’s bicentennial, in a year 2010 that has been 
marked by tremendous human and economic challenges, and after a biennium 2008–2009 
characterized  by  episodes  of  global  recession and  financial  crisis  that we  had  not  seen  in 
decades.  
The Chilean economy has been able to weather these difficulties in an unprecedented way. 
Macroeconomic  stability  has  been preserved  and  the  negative  effects on  employment  and 
output of the turmoil of recent years have been properly dealt with. Thanks to that we are 
now in a process of economic growth and recovery that is substantial, strong and healthy for 
economic activity, demand and employment.  
Indeed, despite the context of an increasingly uncertain global economy, Chile has continued 
to show significant growth rates, has reduced unemployment and has advanced in repairing 
the damages caused by the earthquake and tsunami that hit us last February 27th (27-F). At 
the  same  time,  after  a prolonged  period  of  very  low  and  even  below-zero  figures, inflation 
has returned to the defined tolerance range and is headed, according to our own projections 
and private expectations, toward levels consistent with the 3% target range (figure 1). 
That the stimulative monetary policy applied during all of 2009 bore fruit is without question. 
The extraordinarily expansionary conditions implemented more than a year ago by way of a 
historical reduction in the monetary policy interest rate, together with special liquidity facilities 
and the communication that the monetary policy rate (MPR) would be kept at its minimum 
level  throughout  the  second  quarter  of  this  year,  limited  the  persistence  of  the  negative 
effects of the crisis on the capacity of households, firms, and financial institutions to repay 
their debts and generate income. Furthermore, these measures helped set the grounds for 
the vigorous economic upturn we are seeing now.  
The  expansionary  monetary  stance  of  early  this  year  permitted,  also,  to  keep  at  bay  the 
financial  effects  of  the  earthquake  and  provide  a  lending  environment  that  would  foster 
reconstruction. Toward the second quarter of this year, as confidence returned, with reliable 
information  that  output  and  demand  were  picking  up,  together  with  prospects  of  inflation 
returning  to  the  target  range,  the  Board  began  a  gradual  process  of  normalization  of  the 
stance of monetary policy. Overall, at its current level the MPR is still expansionary, and will 
continue to provide momentum to the economy (figure 2). 
Since  the  last  Report  that  we  presented  last  June,  incoming  information  point  at  the  real 
sector  consolidating  its  renewed  strength.  Output  and  demand  growth  have  exceeded 
expectations, narrowing the output gap. In that context, as we have said before, the question 
is  not  to  continue  or  not  to  continue  raising  the  MPR,  but  how  fast  to  do  it.  As  we  know, 
delaying  this  process  can  end  up  calling  for  drastic  adjustments,  higher  interest  rates  and

increased pressures from the exchange rate, all of which is detrimental to employment and 
economic activity.  
As detailed in this Report, convergence of inflation to the target in the baseline scenario is 
determined  by  stronger  output  and  stronger  domestic  expenditure,  but  combined  with 
reduced  pressures  from  abroad.  In  addition,  in  the  short  term  we  have  seen  some  prices 
increases, such as transport fares, cigarettes and the stamp tax. As for earlier projections, 
these latter factors will contribute to somewhat less CPI inflation over the coming months. 
The CPI figure published today is a little below the expectations of market agents and our 
own, but as we have said time and again we do not react to the news of the day, although we 
do take them into account to detect the trends. In any case this figure does not change the 
direction of monetary policy. Nor does it modify our forecasts of strong growth with limited 
inflation we include in this Report. Our monetary policy strategy is a preventive one, headed 
to  normalization,  and  does  not  respond  –  luckily  –  to  an  inflationary  spurt  or  to  some 
unsustainable expansion process. 
In this Report’s baseline scenario, gradual progress toward MPR normalization is assumed, 
but its level will continue to be expansionary still for several quarters. As always, the pace of 
normalization  will  depend  on  how  domestic  and  foreign  macroeconomic  conditions  unfold, 
and will be consistent with the inflation target. 
Accordingly,  it  is  essential  that  we  do  not  lose  sight  of  the  external  scenario.  The  latest 
developments  have  increased  uncertainty  about  the  pace  of  global  growth  while  financial 
markets are still highly volatile. Also, the nominal appreciation of the peso over the past few 
months has been substantial. Although the current levels of the real exchange rate do not 
reflect an obvious misalignment with its long-term fundamentals, exchange rate movements 
do affect the conduct of monetary policy significantly, as they play a stabilizing role. Indeed, 
in  mitigating  inflationary  pressures,  an  exchange  rate  appreciation  restrains  the  MPR 
adjustments that could result from only the closing of the output gap.  
One working assumption we use in our projections is that the real exchange rate will change 
little into the long term. Any movements away from its trend are possible in a floating regime. 
Its potential financial effects on aggregate output and inflation will be definitely considered by 
the Board as an input for its future decisions. 
As  we  have  demonstrated  in  the  past,  our  monetary  policy  is  highly  flexible.  It  has 
contributed  enormously  to  the  good  standing  the  Chilean  economy  enjoys  today,  in  an 
environment of stable prices and restored employment and output. Now I will review the main 
features  of  the  macroeconomic  conditions  we  believe  are  the  most  likely  for  the  next  two 
years and its implications for inflation and monetary policy. 
Macroeconomic scenario 
The first closing of second-quarter National Accounts showed GDP growth at 6.5% y-o-y. In 
terms of velocity, the second quarter ended with an annualized quarterly variation of around 
20%  (figure  3).  Domestic  demand  also  grew  above  forecasts,  driven  by  increased  private 
consumption and a strong rebound of investment. Such dynamism has responded to not only 
temporary  factors  but  also  to  more  persistent  ones.  Among  the  temporary  factors,  what 
stands out is the immediate repair of the damages caused by the catastrophe of 27-F and 
the reversal of the dramatic contraction of domestic demand during 2009, associated to the 
then high levels of uncertainty. These elements resulted in a swelling of inventories, durable 
goods purchases and investments in machinery & equipment. 
Among  the  more  persistent  phenomena  that  are  driving  demand  and  output  are  the 
stimulative  effect  of  monetary  policy,  in  an  environment  where  the  agents’  balance  sheets 
suffered no permanent damages from either the crisis or 27-F.

 BIS Review 126/2010
Furthermore,  different  measures  show  that  financial  conditions  have  advanced  toward 
normalization in recent months, with a more favorable scenario in terms of both interest rates 
and banks’ lending standards. According to the banking credit survey of the second quarter, 
credit access conditions were relaxed at the same time that a strengthening of demand was 
observed.  Loans  have  continued  to  grow,  and  interest  rates  are  still  low  (figure  4).  This 
combines with the good performance of the labor market and expectations of consumers and 
firms in the optimistic or near-neutral levels.  
Reconstruction  works  in  the  aftermath  of  27-F have  affected  domestic  expenditures,  albeit 
with  a  different  composition  than  was  foreseen  immediately  after  the  disaster.  At  first, 
everyone expected that public and private efforts would focus primarily on infrastructure and 
construction,  but  capital  goods  imports  and  inventory  replacement  ended  up  being  much 
more  significant.  Still,  the  baseline  scenario  assumes  that  building  investment  will  pick  up 
substantially towards the end of this year and in 2011, with some moderation of investment in 
machinery & equipment, which is already visible. 
Internationally,  the  weak  incoming  indicators  for  output  and  employment  in  the  U.S.  have 
increased  the  concerns  over  a  slower  economic  recovery  of  that  country.  World  growth 
forecasts are maintained for 2010, basically due to better than expected figures in the first 
half, and because the latest data point at a weaker second half (figure 5). The breakdown 
across  regions  has  changed,  with  increased  participation  of  emerging  economies.  In  the 
main  developed  countries,  manufacturing  production  has  decelerated.  So  far,  consensus 
forecasts  do  not  fully  consider  this  scenario,  although  financial  asset  prices  have  implicit 
slower growth for the U.S. and foresee a delay in monetary policy normalization. Accordingly, 
the  Board  assumes  for  the  baseline  scenario  global  growth  again  lower  than  market 
consensus for 2010 and 2011 (table 1).  
In  international  financial  markets,  risks  associated  to  the  fiscal  and  financial  conditions  in 
Europe are less imminent, as reflected in banks’ risk premiums and some liquidity indicators 
in money markets. Uncertainty remains, however, relating with the risk of further weakening 
of output in the developed world, causing a decline in long-term interest rates in the U.S., the 
Eurozone, and Japan since June, to levels similar to or even below the troughs of late 2008 
(figure 6). 
Taking all these aspects in consideration, the Board estimates that during this year GDP will 
grow between 5.0% and 5.5%. The range for this year has been upgraded from June, based 
on actual data above projections in the first half and more dynamic figures available for third-
quarter  demand  and  output,  which  are  foreseen  to  continue  into  the  first  half  of  2011, 
prompting output gaps to close in this latter period (figure 7).  
For  the  year  2011  GDP  is  expected  to  grow  by  5.5%–6.5%.  Moderation  of  world  growth 
towards  2011,  the  dissipation  of  one-time  effects  of  the  crisis  and  27-F,  plus  the  gradual 
withdrawal  of  monetary  policy  stimulus  will  result  in  both  output  and  domestic  demand 
slowing down by the second half of 2011. It is worth noting that y-o-y GDP growth figures in 
the second quarter of 2011 will be high due to the low basis for comparison associated to the 
earthquake.  Similarly,  once  the  swelling  of  domestic  demand  is  finished,  it  should  expand 
next  year  at  a  rate  the  half  of  the  strong  growth  it  should  post  this  year.  This  will  come 
accompanied with more dynamic export volume growth that will revert the tough 2009 and 
2010 years, when exports were affected by the global recession and by the disruptive effects 
of the earthquake (table 2). 
The  rebound  of  the  Chilean  economy  is  also  apparent  in  a  dynamic  labor  market,  where 
employment is growing strongly and the rate of unemployment has dropped (figure 8). As for 
fiscal  policy,  this  Report’s  baseline  scenario  considers  the  announcements  made  by  the 
authority, which do not mention any significant changes in the fiscal stimulus for the coming 
years from last June. 
The behavior of output and demand will determine a current account deficit of –1.1% of GDP 
this year increasing in 2011. At trend prices, these figures are large by historical standards, 
BIS Review 126/2010

reflecting the transitory effects of post 27-F on investment and saving, but should moderate 
as these transitory effects dissipate.  
In  this  Report’s  baseline  scenario,  despite  the  faster  closing  of  the  output  gap,  headline 
inflation  will  follow  a  path  similar  to  the  one  forecast  before,  but  core  inflation  will  be 
somewhat  more  limited.  This  difference  owes  primarily  to  some  specific  prices  and  to  the 
incidence of reduced inflationary pressures from abroad (excluding foodstuffs).  
Also,  the  inflation  path  is  also  influenced  by  the  recent  and  forecast  dynamics  of  the  real 
exchange rate (RER). The peso has appreciated in nominal terms by around 7% since our 
last  Report,  partly  responding  to  the  performance  of  the  dollar  in  world  markets.  In  our 
projections,  we  use  as  a  working  assumption  that  the  RER  will  be  unchanged  in  the  long 
term,  which  is  consistent  with  its  long-term  fundamentals  (figure  9).  Reduced  inflationary 
pressures associated to the stronger peso certainly affect inflation prospects in this Report, 
partly offsetting the effects on prices of the rapid closing of the output gap. As has happened 
under  different  circumstances,  any  movements  of  the  exchange  rate  away  from  the  trend 
assumed as a working assumption is possible in a floating regime, and its potential effects on 
the financial system, output or employment will be considered by the Board as inputs for their 
future decisions. 
Summarizing, for the rest of this year, annual CPI inflation is expected to return to figures 
around  3%  to  then  move  to  the  upper  limit  of  the  tolerance  range  for  some  months.  This 
short-term trajectory is influenced by one-time effects, which will eventually revert, permitting 
inflation  to  hover  around  3%  throughout  2011  and  to  the  end  of  the  relevant  projection 
horizon, this time the third quarter of 2012. Y-o-y CPIX1 inflation will describe a more gradual 
convergence to 3%, largely because the shorter-term effects on inflation are concentrated in 
items outside the CPIX1. Private expectations are not very different from this (figure 10). 
The Board estimates that it will continue withdrawing the monetary stimulus at a pace that 
will depend on how domestic and external macroeconomic conditions unfold. This process of 
MPR  normalization  was  begun  in  June  and  continued  in  the  meetings  of  July  and  August 
– with increases of 50 basis points each time – taking the MPR to 2% y-o-y. Going forward, 
the market has internalized a process of withdrawal of the monetary stimulus in the coming 
quarters. This is consistent with the progressive normalization of credit conditions, which is 
visible in various markets and indicators. The different surveys and asset prices can be read 
in more than a way in regards the true pace of normalization. 
Actually, the same as in June, the MPR implicit in swap contracts is lower than the one that 
can be inferred from the forward curve, mainly reflecting significant differences between the 
rates on non-indexed Central Bank bonds and swap contract as equivalent maturities. It is 
possible that these differences originate in the type of institutions operating in each market, 
which are not fully integrated, reflecting different preferences for instruments in pesos and in 
UF by resident and non-resident institutions. Similarly, this partial integration may mean that 
swap  contract  rates  reflected  more  quickly  and  more  intensely  the  movements  of  risk-free 
interest rates abroad.  
The  baseline  scenario  of  this  Report  uses  as  a  working  assumption  an  MPR  trend  that  is 
comparable  to  the  one  observed  in  various  expectations  surveys  (figure  11).  Certainly,  if 
actual  conditions  differ  from  those  assumed  in  this  baseline  scenario,  alternative  policy 
measures will be required.  
Specifically,  the  Board  believes  that  the  scenario  outlined  here  is  subject  to  a  number  of 
risks. Considering that in June domestic demand – and output – already was showing faster 
than foreseen velocity, we cannot rule out gaps closing faster than assumed in the baseline 
scenario. Nor can we rule out that some part of that strength responded to merely temporary 
factors, such as the earthquake, and output will slow down before we think.  
In  the  global  context,  several  risks  are  still  latent.  U.S.  growth  may  weaken  more  than 
foreseen, with effects on financial markets – in particular stock index reversals – and new 
4 
 BIS Review 126/2010
postponements  of  the  monetary  stimulus  withdrawal.  The  fiscal  accounts  in  developed 
economies  –  especially  in  some  countries  in  Europe  –  is  still  cause  for  concern,  mainly 
because of their effects on perceived risks and in the final recovery of the world economy. 
Furthermore, measures adopted in China to limit credit growth and prevent an overheating 
may  result  in  a  weaker  world  economy  and  lower  commodity  prices.  As  usual,  the 
persistence of global imbalances entails risks both on capital flows across economic areas 
and on the behavior of parities between different currencies. 
In the recent past, the trajectory of international food prices has reopened the concern on its 
future  performance  and  its  impact  on  inflation,  given  the  high  degree  of  pass-through  we 
observed in Chile from world price hikes in 2007 and the first half of 2008. Overall, it is not 
that clear that, if wheat prices continue to rise internationally, the local economy will replicate 
them, because domestic margins have remained fairly large.  
If any of these scenarios materializes, there will be direct consequences for the growth and 
inflation  scenario  foreseen  by  the  Board.  After  considering  all  the  elements  described,  the 
Board believes that the balance of risks for inflation and output is unbiased, and we reiterate 
that we will continue to use our policies with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% 
in the policy horizon. 
Concluding remarks 
Let  me  finish  with  some  short  reflections.  After  several  years  of  heavy  turbulences  and 
natural disasters, the Chilean economy is on a very good standing to continue on a path of 
sustained growth. 
Price stability has been preserved, preventing inflation from affecting the purchasing power 
of citizens, especially those with less income and thus less capability to protect themselves 
against this menace. Growth has consolidated, pushing the rate of job creation to levels we 
had  not  seen  in  years.  The  contribution  of  monetary  policy  to  this  good  performance  is 
unquestionable.  It  has  been  flexible  enough  to  be  able  to  be  applied  when  facing  sharp 
changes in the economic environment, with no unnecessary dogma or rigidities.  
In order for this process to continue over time it needs to be balanced and operate in the 
context  of  an  inflation  rate  in  line  with  the  target.  Otherwise  it  will  become  just  an 
unsustainable acceleration calling for drastic adjustments with its related costs in lost output 
and employment. 
Evidently,  as  a  country  we  continue  to  face  challenges,  particularly  related  to  maintain 
sustainable  growth  rates  for  long  periods  and  not  create  tensions  on  price  stability. 
Guaranteeing low and stable inflation is the best contribution that the Central Bank of Chile 
can  make  to  prosperity  in  this  new  century  of  independent  life  that  is  beginning  for  our 
Republic.  
Thank you.
