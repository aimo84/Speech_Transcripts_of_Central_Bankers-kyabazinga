 Svein Gjedrem: A central banker’s comparison of the Nordic countries 
Introduction by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the panel 
discussion of the ACI Nordic Congress, Göteborg, 24 August 2002. 
Please note that the text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation. 
 For outsiders, it may be convenient to see the Nordic region as consisting of countries with very similar 
characteristics. However, the countries are different in several ways. 
First, they differ in their relations to the EU and with respect to their monetary policy regimes. Sweden, 
Denmark  and  Finland  are  members  of  the  EU.  Finland  is  also  a  member  of  EMU.  The  euro  has 
replaced the markka as legal tender, and Finland and the other 11 member countries of EMU have a 
common  monetary  policy.  Denmark  is  in  ERM  II  while  Sweden,  Iceland  and  Norway  have  inflation 
targets. 
In Norway the inflation target of 2½ per cent was adopted on 29 March 2001 and now functions as the 
nominal  anchor  for  the  Norwegian  economy.  The  introduction  of  the  inflation  target  did  not  imply  a 
significant shift in the way monetary policy was conducted. However, the introduction of the inflation 
target  brought  monetary  policy  in  Norway  more  in  line  with  common  practice  internationally,  and 
facilitated communication. 
Although the approaches differ, inflation has been relatively low and stable in the Nordic countries in 
recent years. 
Second, the Nordic countries are different in terms of industrial structure. The sector composition of 
the three Scandinavian stock exchanges provides an illustration. The Oslo Stock Exchange is heavily 
dominated by the energy sector, which is practically absent in Stockholm, Copenhagen and the two 
other  Nordic  exchanges.  Norway  has  small  traditional  industries,  but  the  IT  and  telecom  sector  is 
comparable  to  the  other  countries’  in  relative  size.  The  different  sector  composition  of  the  stock 
exchanges also illustrates the potential for diversification by investing across the Nordic countries. The 
differences in industrial structure imply that international economic developments will affect the Nordic 
countries differently. Most notably, an oil price shock will have the opposite effect in Norway than in 
the other Nordic economies. 
In 2001, the petroleum sector in Norway accounted for around 20 per cent of total investments, 45 per 
cent of exports, 24 per cent of GDP and 35 per cent of central government revenues. The government 
net cash flow from the petroleum sector has increased in recent years. Since 1995, the fiscal surplus 
has been invested in the Government Petroleum Fund. The size of the Fund has increased rapidly in 
the  last  few  years,  and  will  reach  close  to  100  per  cent  of  GDP  towards  the  end  of  this  decade, 
according  to  estimates  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  By  investing  a  substantial  part  of  petroleum 
revenues abroad, the Government Petroleum Fund limits the effect of the current account surplus on 
the exchange rate. 
GDP growth in Norway has been relatively high since 1990, also when excluding the petroleum sector. 
GDP  for  Mainland-Norway  has  on  average  increased  by  2.8  per  cent  annually  since  1990.  This 
compares to 1.7 per cent in Sweden, 2.1 per cent in Denmark, 1.9 per cent in Finland and 2.5 per cent 
in Iceland over the same period. The differences for average GDP growth since 1995 are somewhat 
smaller. 
Although GDP growth in Norway was moderate in 2001, capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy 
remains high. So far, the impact of the international slowdown on the Norwegian economy has been 
limited,  partly  due  to  high  oil  prices.  Unemployment  has  been  low  since  the  mid-1990’s.  Private 
consumption  is  expected  to  remain  buoyant  due  to  high  wage  growth  and  an  expansionary  fiscal 
policy in the years ahead. Prices for domestically produced goods and services are rising fast. Inflation 
in Norway is being dampened by a close to zero rise in prices for imported consumer goods. 
The different cyclical developments in Norway are also reflected in the stock market. Norwegian stock 
prices have become much less correlated with world markets over the last years. The correlation is 
considerably lower than in the other Nordic countries. The correlation for Denmark is also rather low, 
but this is partly due to low exchange rate correlation. When looking at the correlations using national 
currencies, the Danish correlation is higher and more in line with that for Sweden and Finland.

 Iceland and Norway have the highest key interest rates among the Nordic countries, at 7.9 and 7.0 per 
cent respectively. Rates are considerably lower in Sweden (4.25), Denmark (3.50) and Finland (3.25). 
Wage developments over the last few years can contribute to explaining the differences. In Norway 
wage growth has been high over the last five years, reflecting a tight labour market. Looking at data for 
wage growth from the OECD, the ranking of interest rate levels in the Nordic region corresponds to the 
ranking of average wage growth since 1998. 
The  Norwegian  krone  has  appreciated  by  around  15  per  cent  since  mid-2000.  Seen  over  a  longer 
period, the krone has been rather stable. The present level is only around 6 per cent stronger than in 
1990. Over this longer period, other Nordic currencies have shown larger fluctuations. 
Over the  last two  years, the appreciation of the Norwegian krone has been driven by the  wide and 
increased interest rate differential between Norway and other countries. The interest rate differential 
reflects high growth in wages and aggregate demand in Norway. There is thus a clear link between 
cost pressures in the Norwegian economy and the exchange rate. The link works through interest rate 
expectations  driving  the  krone  upwards.  The  appreciation  of  the  krone  has  a  dampening  effect  on 
inflation. At the same time, profitability in the internationally exposed sector is under pressure both due 
to higher wage costs and the appreciation of the krone. 
But the krone can move in both directions. It will not appreciate indefinitely. If the krone follows the 
path of the forward rate, it will depreciate in the years ahead. The forward effective krone exchange 
rate two years ahead is close to the average level of the effective exchange rate during the 1990s.
