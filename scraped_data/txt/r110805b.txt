Caleb M Fundanga: Recent economic developments in Zambia 
Talking notes by Dr Caleb M Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, with the business 
community in Kitwe, Kitwe, 25 July 2011. 
 RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
Introduction 
 
The Zambian economy has recorded significant positive developments following the 
implementation of various reforms. This is reflected in positive real GDP since the 
early  2000s,  low  and  falling  inflation,  a  downward  trend  in  lending  interest  rates, 
favourable external sector performance as well as relative stability in the exchange 
rate of the Kwacha.  
These  developments  can  be  attributed  to  improved  monetary  and  fiscal  policy 
management  and  improved  economic  management,  which  in  turn  has  enhanced 
investor confidence.  
Real gross domestic product (GDP) 
 
Zambia’s  national  output,  as  measured  by  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP),  has 
grown  by  an  average  of  6.4 percent  annually  in  the  last  five  years.  The  Zambian 
economy  grew  by  7.6 percent  in  2010,  compared  to  6.4 percent  in  2009,  and 
exceeded the target of 5 percent.  
The  key  contributors  to  the  sustained  increase  in  economic  activity  have  been 
increased production in the mining, agricultural and construction sectors.  
The  agricultural  sector  recorded  a  historical  bumper  maize  harvest  of  over 
2.8 million metric tonnes during the 2009/10 season and another 3.0 metric tonnes 
during  the  2010/11  harvest  season.  This  was  supported  by  favourable  weather 
conditions and the Farmer Input Support programme.  
Performance  of  the  mining  sector  increased  following  higher  output  arising  from 
increased  capacity  utilisation  at  various  mines  and  investments  into  operations  at 
various  mines.  Metal  mining  was  the  main  driver  of  this  growth,  with  copper  and 
cobalt  output  growing  by  17.4%  and  49.4%  to  819,159.19  mt  and  8,781  mt, 
respectively.  
Construction  output  was  driven  by  increased  public  and  commercial  infrastructure 
projects  around  the  country,  as  well  as  continued  high  demand  for  housing.  This 
was supported by expansion in domestic production of cement.  
Inflation 
 
Consistent  with  the  favourable  performance  in  economic  growth,  the  country  has 
succeeded  in  lowering  inflation.  Inflation  has  declined  from  17.2 percent  in  2003, 
9.9 percent in 2009 and stood at 7.9 percent at end-2010. Inflation continued to be 
moderate, and stood at 9.0 percent as at June 2011.  
The decrease in inflation over the years can be attributed to prudent monetary policy 
and a relatively stable exchange rate. The increase in food supply, arising from the 
favourable  crop  harvest,  has  also  been  a  key  factor  in  moderating  inflationary 
pressures in light of high and increasing prices of petroleum products due to high 
international oil prices.

Interest rates 
 
Interest rates have generally been on a declining trend in line with the fall in inflation 
and yield rates on Government securities. This trend was broken as a result of the 
financial crisis in 2008. 
Commercial banks’ average lending rates decreased to 27.9 percent in 2010 from 
28.4 percent in 2009. In June 2011, average lending rates stood at 26.0 percent.  
In the Government securities market, the weighted average Treasury bill yield rate 
was  7.7 percent  in  2010,  from  9.5 percent  in  2009.  Similarly,  Government  bonds 
composite yield rate fell to 12.3% from 15.9 percent in 2009. As at June 2011, the 
weighted  average  Treasury  bill  rate  was  10.0 percent,  while  the  composite  bond 
yield rate was 15.7 percent.  
External sector performance 
 
The external sector recorded favourable performance, as evidenced by an increase 
in  the  balance  of  payments  surplus  and  a  rise  in  the  country’s  gross  international 
reserves.  
The  country’s  gross  international  reserves  rose  to  US$2,093.7  million  from 
US$1,924.2 million in 2009. This followed increased receipt of donor funds as well 
as  recovery  in  the  global  economy  that  saw  increased  demand  and  international 
prices for most commodities, including copper.  
The  Balance  of  Payments  (BoP)  recorded  a  surplus  of  US$138.1 million  in  2010. 
The  surplus  was  attributed  to  the  positive  outturn  of  the  current  account  to 
US$982 million in 2010 from a deficit of US$378 million in 2009. This was mainly on 
account  of  an  improvement  in  Zambia’s  trade  balance,  which  increased  by 
312.8 percent to US$2,076.5 million from a surplus of US$503 million in 2009.  
Total  merchandise  export  earnings  rose  by  71.2 percent  to  US$7,261.7  million  in 
2010 from US$4,242.8 million recorded in 2009, following increases in both metal 
and non-traditional export earnings.  
Metal  export  earnings  rose  by  81.6 percent  to  US$6,071.7 million  in  2010  from 
US$3,343.1 million 
in  2009,  of  which  copper  export  earnings  were  US 
$5,767.9 million  and  cobalt  export  earnings  were  US  $303.8 million.  This  was 
explained by the rise in copper and cobalt production following increased capacity 
utilisation at various mines and higher global market prices.  
Exports  of  non-traditional  products  registered  a  growth  of  34.3 percent 
to 
US$1,279.3  million  in  2010  from  US$952.5  million  the  previous  year.  This  was 
driven  by  higher  exports  of  copper  wire,  cane  sugar,  burley  tobacco,  cotton  lint, 
electrical cables, gemstones, maize and maize seed, and wheat and meslin.  
Total  merchandise  imports  grew  by  40.3  to  US$4,788.8  million  in  2010  from  US 
$3,413.4 million in 2009.  
Exchange rate 
 
Following  strong  macroeconomic  fundamentals  and  increased  supply  in  foreign 
exchange, the Kwacha performed favourably against all the major traded currencies 
in 2010, except for the South African Rand. The Kwacha appreciated by 4.7 percent 
against US dollar to trade at K4,798.36/US$ from K5,033.95/US$ in 2009.  
Similarly, the Kwacha appreciated by 6.0 percent against the British Pound and by 
8.0 percent against the Euro to trade at K7,392.04/£ and K6,362.14/€, respectively.

However,  the  Kwacha  registered  a  depreciation  of  8.8 percent  against  the  South 
African Rand.  
Fiscal sector developments 
 
Fiscal  prudence  has  improved  over  the  past  years,  with  domestic  revenues 
performing well following higher collections of value added taxes, as well as income 
taxes from mining companies.  
This in effect has also been seen in increased government expenditure on growth-
supporting activities such as infrastructure and social sector spending. Over the last 
few  years,  Government  has  also  reduced  its  borrowing  from  the  banking  sector, 
thereby avoiding the crowding out of the private sector and contributing to downward 
movements in interest rates.  
Financial sector developments 
 
The overall financial condition and performance of the financial sector in 2010 was 
satisfactory,  as  reflected  in  adequate  capitalisation  and  most  financial  institutions 
meeting their minimum regulatory requirements.  
The  banking  sector  was  adequately  capitalized  and  asset  quality,  liquidity  and 
earnings  performance  remained  satisfactory.  The  Bank  granted  a  licence  to 
International  Commercial  Bank  (Z)  Limited,  bringing  the  number  of  commercial 
banks operating in the country to 18.  
Similarly, the overall financial performance and condition of the Non-Bank Financial 
Institutions  (NBFIs)  in  2010  was  fair.  On  average,  the  leasing  finance  institutions 
and  bureaux  de  change  sub-sectors  reported  adequate  capital,  fair  asset  quality, 
liquidity position and earnings performance.  
Prospects for 2011 
 
 
Several indicators point to continued strong economic performance in 2011.  
Real GDP is projected to grow by at least 6.8 percent and will continue to be driven 
by strong performance in the agricultural, mining, construction and tourism sectors. 
This will be aided by anticipated strong performance in the external sector, already 
reflected by favourable performance in the first half of the year.  
Inflation  is  expected  to  slow  down  to  7.0 percent  by  end  of  2011.  The  bumper 
harvest recorded during the 2010/11 harvest season is expected to dampen effects 
on overall inflation through the food component.  
In  the  mining  sector,  copper  production  is  expected  to  increase  due  to  continued 
investments in the mining sector.  
In addition, the major infrastructure projects currently taking place are expected to 
support growth in the construction sector.  
As  the  global  economy  continues  to  recover  from  effects  of  the  global  economic 
crisis, growth in tourism is also expected in 2011.  
The positive developments recorded in the Zambian economy thus far will go a long 
way  is  shaping  tomorrow’s  future.  This  should  trickle  down  to  all  sectors  of  the 
economy  and  raise  employment  and  income  opportunities  for  Zambians,  and 
therefore be lifted the majority of people out of poverty.

IMPLICATIONS OF RECLASSIFICATION OF ZAMBIA TO MIDDLE INCOME STATUS 
 
Effective July 1, 2011, Zambia has been reclassified by the World Bank as a lower 
middle  income  nation.  Lower  middle-income  countries  are  those  with  per  capita 
gross national incomes (GNIs) of between US $1,006 and US $3,975 per year; while 
upper  middle-income  countries  are  those  with  GNIs  between  US $3,976  and 
US $12,275.  This  status  reflects  the  continued  economic  growth  that  has  been 
registered in the recent years.  
Zambia’s  reclassification  as  a  middle  income  country  would  enhance  investor 
confidence  and  further  boost  the  investment  climate  thereby  creating  jobs  and 
wealth  for  the  people.  In  terms  of  financing,  it  should  be  noted  that  with  the  new 
arrangement,  the  government  would  be  able  to  access  more  non  concessional 
financing which remain key for infrastructure development necessary for economic 
development. This is in contrast with the previous status whereby Zambia could only 
access  limited  concessional  financing  which  attracted  very  low  interest  rates  and 
payable after a long time.  
Despite the positive reclassification, it should be noted that the disparity between the 
poor and the rich would always be there and do exist even in developed countries. 
The  challenge  for  the  Government  is  to  implement  policies  that  will  redistribute 
wealth so that inequality is reduced.  
Nevertheless, with reclassification, it shows that the Government has been working 
very  hard  to  accelerate  economic  growth,  which  is  a  necessary  for  economic 
development.  
On  average,  people  have  been  pulled  out  from  poverty  as  per  capita  income  has 
risen from US $300 in 2000 to over US $1000 in 2010.  
Countries in Africa that are in this class, lower middle income, include the following 
Angola,  Cameroon,  Cape  Verde,  Republic  of  Congo,  Côte  d’Ivoire,  Djibouti,  Arab 
Republic of Egypt, The Gambia, Ghana, Lesotho, Mauritania, Morocco, Nigeria and 
São Tomé and Principe.  
IMPLICATIONS OF SOVEREIGN CREDIT RATING 
 
The rating that has been assigned to Zambia reflects strong economic performance 
as  shown  by  the  GDP  growth  rate.  This  has  also  been  supported  by  low  rate  of 
inflation  and  fiscal  deficits,  external  sector  performance  supported  by  the  mining 
sector, and activities in key economic sectors, including agriculture and tourism, as 
well  as  strong  external  balance  position  after  huge  debt  relief  from  international 
creditors obtained in 2005.  
The  rating  puts  the  Zambian  business  community  and  government  in  a  strong 
position to access finance globally at risk adjusted interest rates for investment that 
is  essential  for  sustained  economic  growth  and  improved  living  conditions  of  the 
citizens.  
Furthermore,  the  rating  entails  transparency  in  the  economic  management  of  the 
country’s  resources  and  provides  an  opportunity  for  the  country  to  work  on  the 
weaknesses identified by the rating agencies. For instance, from the rating report it 
was noted that Zambia still faces challenges in the energy sector and infrastructure 
development.  It  therefore,  follows  that  once  the  country  addresses  the  identified 
weaknesses, the rating could improve.  
In  summary,  the  rating  assigned  to  Zambia  shows  stability  and  predictability  of 
government policies and signals improvements in the business environment. This is 
also  comparable  to  our  peers  in  Africa.  With  increased  globalisation  of  the  world 
        4

economy, there is no doubt that Zambia stands to benefit from the rating assigned 
on  condition  that  the  country  adopts  appropriate  policies  that  are  supportive  to 
sustainable economic growth environment.  
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN MINING AND MANUFACTURING (MFEZ) 
A. 
 
Mining 
Growth  in  the  Zambian  mining  and  quarrying  sector  has  continued  to  be  strong 
since  privatisation.  In  2010,  the  growth  in  the  sector  was  15.2%  (20.2%  in  2009), 
thus contributing strongly to the 7.6% real GDP growth in 2010.  
Growth  in  metal  mining  was  16.0%  with  copper  and  cobalt  output  increasing  by 
17.4% and 49.4% to 819,159.19 mt and 8,781 mt, respectively.  
During the first half of 2011, total copper output at 414,984.5 mt, was 4.0% higher 
than  399,062.0  mt  produced  during  the  corresponding  period  of  2010.  Similarly, 
cobalt output was 4,352.7 mt, 8.5% higher than 4,012.8 mt produced in the first half 
of 2010.  
This outturn was largely explained by the increase in the scale of production by the 
mines coupled with the rebound in copper prices, following the relative recovery in 
the global economy.  
Manufacturing 
Performance  of  the  manufacturing  sector  in  2010  and  the  first  half  of  2011  have 
been  favourable  with  a  4.1%  growth  in  2010  (2.2%  in  2009).  Growth  has  largely 
been  driven  by  agro-processing  (food  &  beverages),  including  production  of  non-
metallic mineral and fabricated metal goods, chemicals, explosives and construction 
materials (such as cement).  
Growth in Agro-processing has been supported in part by the last two maize bumper 
harvests, 2010 (2.8 million mt of maize) and (3.0 million mt of maize 2011).  
Strong  construction  activities  have  stimulated  strong  demand  for  manufacture  of 
construction materials particularly cement and cement-related products.  
Total  cement  output  by  the  country’s  three  manufacturing  plants  (Lafarge  Zambia 
Plc, Oriental Quarries and Zambezi Portland Plc) rose by 37.9% to 1,126,728 mt in 
2010 from 817,223.0 mt in 2009. Further, during the first half of 2011 cement output 
at  617,115.2  mt  was  36.0%  higher  than  the  453,791.0  mt  produced  in  the 
corresponding half of 2010.  
Multi-facility economic zones 
Zambia’s  goal  catalyzing  industrial  and  economic  development  through  increased 
activity  in  the  manufacturing  sector  has  led  the  country  to  embark  on  the 
development  of  Multi-Facility  Economic  Zones  (MFEZs)  in  selected  parts  of  the 
country. Among the MFEZs are:  
– 
in 
The  Chambishi  MFEZ  (construction 
partnership  with  the  Chinese  government  with  a  commitment  of  over  US  $1 
billion;  
Two Lusaka MFEZs (preparatory phases) and one industrial park. One of the 
Lusaka  MFEZs,  the  Lusaka  South,  will  be  developed  in  cooperation  with  a 
Malaysian firm at an estimated cost of US $1 billion;  
is  advanced)  being  developed

 Solwezi (Lumwana) (preparatory phase).  
– 
The MFEZs are expected to significantly contribute to employment creation in the 
country.  
HOW LOCAL BUSINESSES CAN POSITION THEMSELVES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
THE OPPORTUNITIES ARISING FROM THE ABOVE 
 
Local businesses should take advantage of the improved confidence in the Zambian 
economy to access cheaper credit from the international capital markets;  
Higher domestic incomes imply higher domestic demand; thus local producers can 
take  advantage  economies  of  scale  from  increased  production  for  the  domestic 
market;  
Local businesses should also take advantage of the opening up of new mines and 
the establishment of MFEZ in adding local content to the products. This will entail 
making local products and services more competitive.
