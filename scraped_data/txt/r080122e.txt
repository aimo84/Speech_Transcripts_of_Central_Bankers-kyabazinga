John Gieve: The impact of the financial market disruption on the UK 
economy 
Speech by Sir John Gieve, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, to the London Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry, London, 17 January 2008. 
 Introduction 
These are testing times for the MPC. 
The latest official figures for growth confirm the strength of the economy in Q3 with above 
trend  growth  in  domestic  demand  and  a  growing  current  account  deficit.  But  the  evidence 
from surveys and other timely indicators is that growth is slowing quite sharply now, in part 
because of the rises in interest rates last year. That in itself might justify a progressive shift in 
policy – from restrictive to a more neutral stance. And the case for easing has been greatly 
strengthened by the disruption in global credit markets and in our own banking system which 
brings a risk of a deeper downturn.  
However  we  have  also  seen  a  big  rise  in  the  world  prices  of  oil  and  food.  That  is  being 
amplified in the UK by a fall in sterling and is now coming through in our food, petrol, gas and 
electricity prices. These are likely to raise our inflation rate well above target in the coming 
months at a time when short term inflation expectations remain uncomfortably high.  
This combination of upside and downside risks complicates our task of keeping inflation on 
track to meet the 2% target. 
Financial market disruption 
The  disruption  of  credit  and  money  markets  was  set  off  by  a  deterioration  in  the  US  sub-
prime housing market. This started to show up in increasing provisions in the 2006 accounts 
of banks which held them on balance sheet in a traditional way. But impairment charges of 
that  sort  would  not  have  occasioned  such  ferment  in  international  markets.  That  was  the 
result  of  the  impact  on  the  new  markets  for  structured  credit  such  as  Collateralised  Debt 
Obligations (CDO’s)1 (Chart 1), which had developed to meet investors’ demand for higher 
yield.  As  forecasts  of  US  sub-prime  defaults  mounted,  it  became  clear  that  such  products 
had introduced opacity and uncertainty into both the distribution and scale of losses.  
The crisis played itself out in number of “lurches”, which were reflected in the movements in 
the ABX indices2 (Chart 2):  
• 
Although the problems of the sub-prime market were obvious in mid-2006, it wasn’t 
until  January/February  2007  that  the  rising  defaults  led  to  mark  downs  in  indices 
valuing the riskier tranches of the structured products and difficulties at a number of 
US sub-prime originators; 
                                                 
1   Collateralised Debt Obligations are securities backed by a portfolio of fixed-income assets that are issued in 
tranches  of  varying  seniority.  As  default  losses  accrue  to  the  underlying  portfolio  they  are  applied  to 
the securities in reverse order of seniority. The main types of CDOs are those based on portfolios of leveraged 
bank loans (CLOs) and asset-backed securities (ABS CDOs). 
2   The  ABX  indices  are  baskets  of  20  credit  default  swaps  that  provide  insurance  against  default  losses  on 
securities of a given rating and vintage of issuance that are backed by home equity loans. The home equity 
loan category comprises mainly of sub-prime first mortgages, but also second mortgages, mortgages with high 
loan-to-value ratios and home equity lines of credit

   in June, as losses began to appear in highly-rated tranches of so-called mezzanine 
CDOs,  two  heavily  exposed  Bear  Stearns  hedge  funds  collapsed;  the  rating 
agencies began to review their methodologies and started to downgrade securities, 
some by several notches; 
at the end of July, a SIV3 sponsored by IKB reported losses on sub-prime mortgage 
exposures and failed to raise funding in the commercial paper market, and in early 
August BNP Paribas temporarily suspended redemptions from a number of money 
market funds because of valuation problems; this provoked an “investors” strike’ on 
mortgage-backed securities and the commercial paper that funded off-balance sheet 
vehicles holding them; in turn this led banks to hoard liquidity against potential calls 
on their committed lines, to a marked tightening of inter-bank markets and funding 
pressures on banks, including, of course, Northern Rock;  
after a brief lull in October, renewed doubts about the scale of the losses in the big 
international banks led to concerns about counterparty risk and sparked a renewed 
squeeze  in  the  money  markets  with  LIBOR  spreads  climbing  back  to  levels 
experienced in August.  
There are many lessons for markets and the authorities from this turmoil. First it underlined 
the critical importance of liquidity in managing and regulating banks. Second it showed up 
the limitations of the models which underpin the valuation and rating of structured products 
and the excessive weight that had been given to them not just by the naive or unwary, but by 
some  of  the  most  sophisticated  players  in  financial  markets  (including  many  of  the 
sponsoring banks who underestimated the risks they were running in retaining super senior 
tranches). Third, it illuminated the adverse incentives that had been allowed to develop in the 
distribution  chain  for  credit  products  including  the  strong  incentives  for  originators  to  put 
quantity above quality, for the rating agencies to expand their scope as widely as possible, 
and  for  banks  to  use  off-balance-sheet  vehicles  to  finance  structured  credits.  It  may  also 
reveal some flaws in the compensation schemes in banks. In some cases these incentives 
arose  despite  regulation,  in  others  they  were  the  consequence  of  faults  in  the  regulatory 
system. Finally it showed again how measures of risk used by companies and regulators can 
be  pro-cyclical,  encouraging  more  risk  taking  at  the  top  of  the  cycle  and  potentially 
exacerbating the downswing. 
In the last few weeks, markets have been calmer. Liquidity pressures in short-term funding 
markets have eased, helped in part by the co-ordinated action by central banks to address 
elevated funding rates over the year end (Chart 3). And, as losses have been declared it has 
proved  possible  for  a  number  of  firms  such  as  UBS,  Merrill  Lynch  and  Citigroup  to  attract 
new capital including from Sovereign Wealth Funds.  
It is too early to declare the problem solved. The longer term bank funding markets remain 
relatively  illiquid,  many  securitisation  markets  remain  effectively  closed  (Chart  4),  and 
general market sentiment remains fragile. Only a part of the total losses on sub-prime have 
yet been declared and not all the questions about the future of SIVs or the capitalisation of 
monoline  insurers  have  yet  been  answered.  The  sub-prime  chapter  will  not  be  closed  for 
some months yet and there are still risks of re-ignition of the acute money market conditions 
we saw last month.  
But there are grounds for hope that we are reaching the end of the beginning at least and 
that the key challenge is moving from stabilising the financial markets themselves to dealing 
with the impact on the wider economy. 
                                                 
3   Structured  investment  vehicles  are  funds  that  issue  short-term  securities  in  order  to  invest in  longer-term 
securities. The latter have typically comprised mainly of mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed 
securities. Banks sponsored SIVs are managed by banks.

Macroeconomic impact 
Judging  that  impact  is  not  easy.  Banking  crises  have  typically  reflected  macroeconomic 
difficulties at home. Banks have lent too much and too cheaply at the top of the cycle and 
have  then  suffered  from  defaults  when  policy  tightened  and  unemployment  and  failures 
increased. The most recent example in the UK banking sector was during the recession of 
the early 1990s when the major banks wrote off about 2.5%of their domestic loan book and 
tightened credit conditions, thus exacerbating the fall in property prices and in confidence. It 
has been estimated that the effect of the tightening of credit conditions was to reduce UK 
output in 1991 by almost 2% relative to what it would otherwise have been.4 Of course, there 
was little monetary policy could do at that time to offset these effects because of Sterling’s 
ERM membership.  
But  the  current  crisis  does  not  follow  that  pattern.  It  has  come  at  a  time  when  the 
performance of the UK economy has been unusually good. Over the past fifteen years the 
economy has experienced the most stable macroeconomic conditions on record with steady 
growth,  low  inflation  and  a  declining  trend  in  unemployment.5  For  the  most  part  the 
underlying balance sheet position of households and firms is robust and most indicators of 
financial fragility such as mortgage arrears, repossessions and corporate insolvencies are at 
low levels (Chart 5).  
So  the  question  is  whether  we  can  reverse  into  macroeconomic  trouble  starting  from  a 
banking crisis with its origins in the US housing market. Of course a marked slowdown in the 
US  will  diminish  directly  part  of  our  exports.  But  two  domestic  transmission  channels  to 
consumption and investment will determine the size of the overall impact on our economy: 
• 
• 
the effects of credit constraints; and 
impact on expectations and confidence. 
Credit constraints  
With  their  own  funding  rates  increasing  and  a  reduction  in  their  ability  to  distribute  risk 
through  securitisation,  there  is  now  clear  evidence  that  UK  lenders  have  begun  to  tighten 
lending conditions for households and firms. The Bank’s Credit Conditions Survey (CCS) of 
major UK lenders has identified a change in behaviour since the summer.6 Contrary to earlier 
expectations,  lenders  reported  that  the  availability  of  secured  credit  to  households  had 
reduced  noticeably  over  the  three  months  to  mid-December  (Chart  6).  Corporate  credit 
availability  was  also  reported  to  have  been  reduced  significantly  over  the  same  period.  A 
further reduction in the general availability of credit was expected over the next three months.  
The survey suggests that lenders are both raising the price of borrowing and reducing the 
range  of  people  and  firms  they  are  prepared  to  lend  to.  There  has  been  a  pick  up  in  the 
average spread of quoted mortgage rates over the appropriate funding rate in recent months 
(Chart 7). There has also been a fall in the number of mortgage products available for credit-
impaired borrowers (Chart 8).  
The  first  impact  of  the  tightening  in  secured  credit  conditions  is  being  felt  in  the  property 
markets  and  lower  demand  for  assets  but  there  will  also  be  direct  effects  on  activity. 
Although only a minority of households may be credit constrained they are probably sufficient

in number to depress household spending somewhat, possibly reversing a little of the decline 
in  the  saving  ratio  seen  since  the  early  1990s  (Chart  9).  In  a  similar  way  a  tightening  of 
corporate  lending  conditions  will  affect  some  companies’  investment.  The  Deloitte  CFO 
survey  taken  in  early  December  finds  that  20%  of  firms  expect  the  recent  credit  market 
events to have a negative impact on their capital spending in 2008.7
This  tightening  of  credit  conditions  would  be  exacerbated  by  any  further  weakening  in  the 
financial position of banks due to a slowdown in the wider economy. Slower growth and a 
rise in unemployment in particular would lead to higher loan defaults. There are signs that 
this is already happening in consumer lending in the US. Weakening property prices would 
reduce the amount that lenders could realise in the event of default. With pressures on their 
capital  and  new  capital  expensive  where  it  is  available,  banks  are  likely  to  attempt  to 
increase  their margins  and  to  slow  down  new  lending,  thereby  reducing  their  capital 
requirements, for example by tightening non-price terms and conditions on new loans.  
One factor which regulators are watching carefully at present is the impact of the shift this 
month  to  the  Basle  II  system  of  capital  requirements  for  European  banks.  While  Basle  II 
improves  on  its  predecessor  and  removes  many  undesirable  incentives,  it  retains  some 
procyclical features and any transition needs to be managed carefully.8
The impact on expectations and confidence 
The other channel by which the financial market turbulence is likely to have macroeconomic 
effects is by prompting more cautious behaviour by households and firms. This might simply 
reflect uncertainty about the future. Firms may temporarily postpone investment because of 
greater uncertainty about the future path of demand. We saw an effect like this after 9/11 for 
example. But it might also reflect a revision by households and firms about the sustainable 
path of income and wealth in the coming years. The change in expectations may reflect the 
higher costs of borrowing and a higher risk of unemployment. 
Again a reduction in confidence about future growth may lead directly to lower consumption 
and investment. It is also likely to affect equity and property markets. Potential buyers may 
decide  to  wait  before  purchasing  if  they  sense  that  there  is  a  chance  that  prices may  fall. 
Such behaviour can be self-fulfilling.  
There is no doubt that the housing market has been weakening significantly in recent months 
and the trend is more advanced still in commercial property markets where prices are falling 
rapidly. It is widely assumed that weakening property prices will also depress consumption. 
The Bank has tended to be sceptical of this mechanism.9 While property prices and spending 
tend to move together, that doesn’t prove that one causes the other. Both may result from 
changes  in  income  and  expectations  of  future  income.10  Indeed,  in  the  same  way  as  you 
can’t have your cake and eat it, it is not clear that a general increase in house prices does 
create extra spending power for the population as a whole. Owners who expect to remain in 
their current house for a long time cannot also spend their housing wealth and the benefits to 
those trading down are broadly offset by the costs to those trading up. While older owners 
may be richer and believe they can support a more expensive lifestyle, the rise in prices will 
show through in higher rents and larger deposits for those wanting to get on the ladder.

But even if there is not a strong causal connection between house prices and consumption 
through a wealth channel, there may nevertheless be a significant collateral channel. When 
house prices fall, the amount of housing equity and hence collateral at homeowners’ disposal 
decreases. This will tend to delay spending as lenders are willing to lend less or lend on less 
favourable  terms  to  those  who  have  little  or  no  housing  equity.  That  channel  should  have 
become less important in recent years. This is because most homeowners have substantial 
equity in their homes which would not be materially affected by relatively modest changes in 
house prices.11 This may help to account for a decline in the correlation between real house 
price growth and consumption since the beginning of the decade (Chart 10).  
An analogous collateral channel may operate in the corporate sector. Declines in commercial 
property  prices  will  weaken  corporate  balance  sheets  and  this  could  affect  corporate 
spending if lenders raise the cost of borrowing to affected companies. This effect is likely to 
be particularly pronounced among commercial real estate companies. 
Inflation and energy prices  
In  these  ways  the  losses  in  credit  markets  are  already  contributing  to  slowing  growth;  the 
questions are by how much and for how long? The danger that they could turn a necessary 
modest  slowdown  into  a  deeper  and  more  painful  downturn  is  clear  and,  of  course,  that 
would dampen inflationary pressures. That was a key factor in my decision to vote for a cut in 
rates in November and December. 
But  the  current  situation  is  complicated  by  emerging  upside  pressures  on  prices.  This 
inflationary  pressure  is  coming  largely  from  outside  the  UK,  reflecting  in  part  increased 
demand from countries like China where output growth has been both rapid and commodity 
intensive. That has led to renewed strength in commodity prices (Chart 11), with oil rising as 
high as $100 a barrel and some agricultural foods reaching record highs in dollar terms. This 
has  already  increased  the  prices  of  imported  goods,  and  that  effect  has  been  amplified 
recently by the fall in sterling. In turn, it is putting upward pressure on the sterling prices set 
by domestic producers for crude oil and wholesale gas and electricity. And, in contrast to the 
past, demand from emerging economies may mean that commodity prices prove resilient to 
slowing growth in the industrialised economies.  
The appropriate monetary policy reaction to upside pressures on prices coming from outside 
the economy (such as an energy price shock) depends on how households and businesses 
react to that shock – in other words, on so-called “second-round” effects. A key determinant 
of those effects will be the impact on inflation expectations. If households’ and businesses’ 
expectations  of  future  inflation  rise  following  the  initial  price  shock,  pressures  for 
compensating  rises  in  wages  and  prices  are  much  more  likely.  Inflation  expectations  are 
difficult  to  measure,  but  surveys  of  households’  expectations  have  picked  up  since  early 
2005  (Chart  12).  This  partly  reflects  the  rise  in  inflation  during  2005-06.  But  expectations 
have remained elevated during 2007 despite the easing in inflation in the second half of the 
year.   
Conclusion 
After  a  long  period  of  stability,  we  have  experienced  a  major  financial  shock  that  has 
reverberated  through  the  banking  sector  in  all  the  advanced  economies.  It  has  calmed 
recently, but we should expect a prolonged period of discomfort for individual banks and the 
financial system as a whole. Unusually, this shock was not the result of bad loans at home

but  it  will  have  an  impact  on  growth  through  tighter  credit  constraints  and  by  influencing 
expectations  and  confidence.  We  cannot  be  sure  how  large  those  effects  will  be  but  they 
pose a serious downside risk to growth. To make matters more difficult, we face a sharp rise 
in inflation in coming months as a result of rising commodity prices worldwide and a fall in our 
exchange rate.  
In  reaching  our  decisions,  the  MPC  always  looks  not  just  at  the  central  projection  for  the 
economy  but  at  the  risks  on  either  side.  That  will  require  not  just  difficult  judgements  but 
careful explanation in the months ahead.
