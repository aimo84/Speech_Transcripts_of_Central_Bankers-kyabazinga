Joint Session of the Fifth Committees 
of the Chamber of Deputies (Budget, Treasury and Planning) 
and of the Senate of the Republic (Economic Planning and Budget)
Preliminary hearing 
on the Update to the 
2018 Economic and Financial Document
Testimony of the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Italy 
Luigi Federico Signorini
Chamber of Deputies 
Rome, 9 October 2018
Mr President, Honourable Members of Parliament, 
I wish to thank the Fifth Committees of the Chamber of Deputies and of the 
Italian Senate for once again giving the Bank of Italy this opportunity to provide its 
technical assessment as part of the consultations on the Update to the Economic and 
Financial Document. 
1  The macroeconomic outlook
Following the severe crisis of 2008-13, the Italian economy has been recovering 
for the past five years. Last year GDP growth came to 1.6 per cent, with contributions 
from all the components of demand, domestic and foreign. In 2018, notwithstanding 
the overall solidity of domestic demand, the pace of growth gradually moderated, 
affected above all by the slowdown in world trade. Sales outside the EU nonetheless 
turned upwards again in August. Fears of a further spike in trade tensions appear to 
have dented the confidence of firms at international level and risk affecting economic 
activity  even  beyond  the  direct  impact  on  trade  of  the  protectionist  measures 
implemented to date. The situation remains uncertain; the Italian economy is very 
open to foreign trade and is therefore exposed to the related risks.
According to the latest data released by Istat, industrial production fell sharply 
in July. In recent times the statistical variability of the index has intensified and it is 
therefore important not to overestimate the meaning of any one reading. Based on our 
estimates, which draw on updated data on energy consumption and goods flows, in 
August and September there appears to have been a recovery. It is nonetheless still 
likely that production in the third quarter will stagnate overall. What happens in the 
fourth quarter, which has just begun, will mark the point of departure for the level of 
industrial production growth achieved in 2019. The index based on the assessments of 
purchasing managers in industrial sector firms also fell during the summer months. The 
latest cyclical indications are instead more favourable in the service sector. According 
to our quarterly survey conducted in September, firms continue to expect investment 
to increase in 2018, albeit to a lesser extent than was expected six months ago. 
Labour  market  data  continue  to  be  positive.  The  number  of  persons  in 
employment in August was up by 300,000 compared with the end of last year, 
reflecting above all the increase in fixed-term contracts. The employment-intensive 
nature of the recovery has therefore been confirmed.
In  recent  weeks,  signs  of  tension  in  the  financial  markets  have  intensified. 
The yields on Italian government securities have turned upwards again. Funding 
conditions and banks’ market valuations have been affected as a result: in early 
October there was a steep drop in bank share prices and the CDS spreads of the 
leading credit institutions were up sharply on the first half of the year.
Yet still today the central projection remains that of – albeit rather slower – 
economic growth in the short term. In July’s Economic Bulletin we had forecast 
an increase in GDP of 1.3 per cent this year and of 1 per cent in 2019, assuming 
the full deactivation of the safeguard clauses on indirect taxation. The latest data 
suggest that, provided economic policy assumptions remain unchanged, growth 
will be slightly lower both this year and the next.
The  risks,  especially  those  connected  with  the  performance  of  world  trade 
and the conditions on Italy’s financial markets, have intensified. The accentuation 
of the protectionist stances of trade policies, enduring tensions in various parts of 
the world, and the knock-on effects on business confidence, could dampen world 
economic activity next year, slowing the impetus provided so far to our economy 
by the international context. On the home front, protracted tensions on the financial 
markets would have detrimental effects on the funding conditions of households 
and firms and on domestic demand.
The Government’s current legislation macroeconomic scenario, which does 
not  incorporate  the  deactivation  of  the  safeguard  clauses  on  indirect  taxation, 
envisages 1.2 per cent GDP growth this year and 0.9 per cent the next. This figure 
is within the interval of the estimates currently available, even if it is based on 
assumptions  about  exogenous  variables  that  are  relatively  favourable  compared 
with the latest trends. In the two years 2020-21 GDP is expected to expand by 1.1 
per cent.
The policy scenario raises GDP growth forecasts to 1.5 per cent next year, 
1.6 per cent in 2020 and 1.4 per cent in 2021, thanks to the effect of the budgetary 
provisions.
4
These measures are expected to have a significant impact; the Government’s 
estimate assumes that the values of the multipliers of the expansionary measures 
will be higher than those generally estimated for Italy and that the measures set 
out  in  the  Update  will  stimulate  economic  activity  already  in  the  early  months 
of  next  year.  A  more  comprehensive  assessment  would  require  details  that  are 
not yet available on the composition, design and implementation of the measures, 
including their funding.
While for 2019 the VAT increases envisaged under the safeguard clauses have 
been eliminated, for 2020 and 2021 the planning scenario continues to incorporate 
them, at least in part; it therefore results in a future increase in indirect taxation, 
but how this would be designed and its entity are not indicated in the Update. The 
Government  did,  however,  already  announce  that  it  does  not  intend  to  actually 
implement  the  increase,  and  that  it  will  replace  it  with  other  measures  to  cut 
spending and improve tax revenue collection (these measures are also not specified 
further at present).
In addition to the direct effect of the budgetary measures on economic activity, 
the  impact  on  the  confidence  of  savers  and  the  market  must  also  be  taken  into 
consideration. I will return to this point in the concluding section of my address.
2  The public accounts in 2018
The  Update  to  the  Economic  and  Financial  Document  (DEF)  revises  the 
estimate for net borrowing, bringing it to 1.8 per cent of GDP, from 1.6 per cent 
indicated in April’s DEF. The revision stems from a reduction of €3.9 billion in 
revenue, partly connected to lower expected GDP growth, and to an increase of 
€1.9 billion in interest payments.
In September Istat released new national accounts estimates for the last three years. 
Net borrowing for 2017 was revised upwards, from 2.3 to 2.4 per cent of GDP.
Compared with 2017, it is estimated that net borrowing will decrease by over 
half a percentage point of GDP, owing to an increase in the primary surplus (0.4 
percentage points) and a reduction in interest payments (0.2 points). The tax burden 
will decline from 42.2 per cent in 2017 to 41.9 per cent this year, mainly due to 
developments in direct taxes.
5
The  data  observed  so  far  on  the  borrowing  requirement  and  government 
receipts appear consistent with a reduction in net borrowing in the current year. 
Excluding  the  estimated  effects  of  the  main  operations  that  do  not  impact  net 
borrowing and a number of temporal asymmetries, the general government borrowing 
requirement  in  the  first  nine  months  of  2018  (estimated  by  approximating  the  still 
unavailable data for August and September with those for the state sector borrowing 
requirement) decreased compared with the corresponding period of 2017. In the same 
period,  tax  revenue  entered  in  the  State  budget,  net  of  lottery  and  gaming  receipts, 
increased  by  0.5  per  cent  compared  with  the  same  period  of  2017,  above  all  thanks 
to  the  positive  performance  of  VAT  and  personal  income  tax  (Irpef)  revenue.  If  the 
data are adjusted to take account of some asymmetries of a purely accounting nature, 
the estimated increase in revenue would be greater, and basically consistent with the 
growth forecasts of general government tax revenue indicated in the Update.
In the policy scenario, the structural deficit (that is, cyclically-adjusted and 
net of temporary measures) is expected to reach 0.9 per cent of GDP.
The  expected  reduction  in  the  structural  deficit  is  less  than  that  for  the  overall 
deficit  (0.2  percentage  points  versus  0.5  points);  the  difference  is  mainly  due  to  the 
reduction in the output gap, as the net effects of the temporary measures are extremely 
limited in both 2017 and 2018.
According to the Update, in 2018 the debt-to-GDP ratio will fall slightly, 
from  131.2  per  cent  at  end-2017  to  130.9  per  cent.  The  reduction  is  almost  1 
percentage point less than that estimated in April, owing to higher net borrowing 
expectations and, especially, slower nominal GDP growth. 
As  part  of  its  September  revision  of  the  national  accounts  data,  Istat  adjusted 
upwards its nominal GDP estimate for the two years 2016-17. Owing to these changes, 
in both years the debt-to-GDP ratio decreased by about 0.6 percentage points. 
3  Public finance projections for 2019-2021
Current  legislation  scenario.  –  The  Update  revises  the  net  borrowing 
forecasts  for  the  three  years  2019-2021  in  the  current  legislation  scenario, 
raising them (compared with April’s DEF) by 0.4 percentage points for next 
year and by 0.7 points for each of the two years 2020-21. The revision takes 
account of a worsening GDP growth outlook and of higher interest payments 
(more  than  0.1  percentage  points  in  2019,  0.2  points  in  2020  and  0.3  points 
in 2021).
6
Notwithstanding this revision, current legislation net borrowing is expected to 
continue to decrease, also thanks to the safeguard clauses (whose effect is equal to 
0.7 per cent of GDP in 2019 and to 1.0 per cent from 2020 onwards): as a percentage 
of GDP, net borrowing is estimated to fall to 1.2 per cent in 2019, 0.7 per cent in 
2020 and 0.5 in 2021. The nominal budget balance, which according to April’s 
DEF would have been attained in 2020, would now not be achieved in 2021 either. 
The primary surplus, while rising gradually to 3.3 per cent of GDP in 2021, would 
be lower than last April’s estimates by 0.4 percentage points on average each year. 
Interest payments are expected to grow steadily, reaching 3.8 per cent of GDP in 
2021. The higher interest payments compared with April’s estimates, made on the 
basis of the interest rates foreseeable at the time, would amount to about €3 billion 
in 2019, almost €4 billion in 2020, and about €4.5 billion in 2021. If the tensions 
observed in the last two weeks, which have heightened further in recent days, were 
to persist, interest payments could be higher than indicated in the Update.
The Update clarifies that the forecasts are made on the basis of the forward rates 
observed during the period in which the document was prepared, and the macroeconomic 
scenario was developed on the basis of the information available at 22 September 2018. 
Ten-year BTP yields have risen by more than 60 basis points in the last two weeks, and 
those of three-year securities by more than 90 basis points. To give an idea of the relative 
impact, a permanent increase of 100 basis points in the yields of all government bonds 
implies that interest payments will be greater by 0.15 per cent of GDP in the first year, 0.3 
per cent in the second year, and 0.45 per cent in the third year.
Policy scenario. – Compared with the current-legislation scenario, for 2019 
the Government plans to raise net borrowing by more than 1 percentage point, to 
2.4 per cent of GDP. In the following two years the deficit is projected to narrow 
again, an outcome to which the partial activation of the safeguard clauses and the 
resulting VAT increase would also contribute. The remaining safeguard clauses 
are not quantified in detail in the Update; as I observed earlier, the Government has 
already announced it does not intend to implement the increase in indirect taxation. 
In  the  past,  if  activated  or  replaced  with  equivalent  measures,  the  safeguard 
clauses served the purpose of attaining a balanced budget within the planning period. 
In the Update they only help to bring the deficit, at the end of the forecasting horizon, 
to more or less its starting point in 2018. In fact, the Update does not envisage a 
reduction in the structural deficit. Rather, it plans to increase it by 0.8 percentage 
points of GDP next year, bringing it to 1.7 per cent, and to keep it unchanged in the 
following two years. The Government has announced its intention to resume fiscal 
7
consolidation  in  2022,  the  first  year  beyond  the  planning  horizon;  the  resumption 
of  fiscal  consolidation  would  be  brought  forward  only  if,  by  2021,  real  GDP  and 
employment had returned to pre-crisis levels.
The structural deficit will remain at a significant level for a highly-indebted 
country; this does not afford much room for manoeuvre were it to become necessary 
to deal with a new cyclical slowdown.
The  measures  and  their  impact  on  the  economic  cycle.  –  As  I  have  already 
recalled, in the Government’s estimates the expansionary stance of the budgetary 
measures raises real GDP growth forecasts by about half a percentage point each 
year, to 1.5 per cent on average in the next three years.
In 2019 the fiscal policy stance (conventionally measured by the change in the cyclically-
adjusted primary surplus) would be expansionary by almost 1 percentage point; in April’s 
current legislation estimates, it was expected to be restrictive by 0.4 percentage points. In 
the following two years, the stance is expected to be largely neutral.
The macroeconomic effects of the budget depend on its composition and design; 
therefore, an assessment will only be possible once the details have been made known.
In any case, the Update provides an insight into the various areas of planned 
intervention.
The  safeguard  clauses  on  indirect  taxes  are  set  to  be  completely  deactivated 
next year and redesigned in the following years. According to our assessments and 
based on the Bank of Italy’s quarterly econometric model, the expansionary impact 
of this measure will be limited. This assessment is consistent with the Government’s 
estimates contained in the Update. The impact could prove even more limited, or 
nil,  if  the  decision  not  to  increase  VAT  was  already  incorporated  in  households’ 
expectations.
At the same time, the plan is to expand the number of those eligible for the 
‘simplified’ taxation system in place for small firms, professionals and tradespeople.
The  Government  has  announced  that  it  intends  to  introduce  a  new  poverty 
reduction mechanism in 2019 (‘citizenship income’) and to alter the requirements 
for pension eligibility, making them less stringent.
8
An increase in current transfers – such as those relating to social expenditure – 
as well as tax relief tend to have modest and gradual cyclical effects; we estimate 
that the income multiplier associated with these measures is limited.
As far as the ‘citizenship income’ is concerned, pursuing the goal of social 
protection should not disincentivise the supply of labour. A decisive factor in this 
regard is the amount of the benefit in relation to the potential wage that a worker 
could earn on the market; looking at the experience of other countries, it should 
be possible to develop an appropriate design. This is important not only with a 
view to assessing the cyclical impact of the measure on GDP and employment, but 
above all in order to refine the tool from a longer-term perspective.
According to the Update, the benefit – the amount of which has not yet been officially 
established –  will provide income support to people below the relative poverty threshold. 
In other countries, the amount of the benefit in proportion to the national relative poverty 
threshold is usually less than one.1 For a household of just one member, it is less than 50 
per cent on average in the EU countries, with a peak (87 per cent) in the Netherlands; in 
Germany it is 39 per cent, in France, 50 per cent and in Spain, 63 per cent.
The conditions that should regulate eligibility for the benefit (especially its 
withdrawal after a given number of job offers) cannot be applied effectively unless 
job centres are provided with sufficiently increased capacity.
Regarding  social  security,  the  requirements  for  pension  eligibility  are  to 
become less stringent; this measure will be set out in detail at a later date. We 
have  often  pointed  out  that,  when  making  the  pension  age  more  flexible,  it  is 
important  to  respect  the  actuarial  equivalence  principle  in  order  to  ensure  the 
long-term  sustainability  of  the  pension  system,  now  a  key  strength  of  Italy’s 
public finances.
Based on available research into the effects of past pension reforms that raised the 
minimum pension age, it is not possible to maintain that, in the medium-to-long term, an 
increase in the employment rate of older workers leads to worse job prospects for young 
people,2 particularly in the private sector.

The  Government  also  plans  to  allocate  additional  funds  for  public-sector 
investment, amounting to 0.2 percentage points of GDP in 2019, rising to over 0.3 
points in 2021, inverting the trend observed in recent years. Indeed, public investment 
has  diminished  steadily  since  2010;  in  2017  it  represented  2.0  per  cent  of  GDP, 
compared with almost 3 per cent on average in the previous decade.
Investment spending can have a significant impact on GDP growth, not just in 
the short term but in the longer term as well, if investment helps to achieve a structural 
increase  in  production  capacity.  The  Government’s  emphasis  on  the  resumption 
of a major investment programme is therefore something that can be shared. The 
programme’s effectiveness will depend on elements that cannot be taken for granted 
in  Italy:  fast  implementation,  efficient  action,  and  careful  selection  of  projects  to 
identify those likely to produce a real qualitative and quantitative increase in capital. 
In view of the recent contraction, there is probably ample scope to make profitable 
investments; but only if they are properly selected and efficiently realised will they 
be able to achieve positive externalities for the growth of the economy.3 Given the 
time needed to select projects and complete the planning and commissioning phases, 
the increase in spending might not become apparent for some time, diminishing the 
investment’s contribution to growth in the short term.
Funding. – Finally, in order to assess the effects of the budgetary provisions, in 
terms of both growth stimulus and public accounts, it will be necessary to look carefully 
at how the costs will be covered once the funding measures have been finalised.
According to the Update, part of the funds should come from ending (in whole or in 
part) existing programmes such as the inclusion income support scheme, the optional tax 
regime offered to some types of businesses (tax on entrepreneurial income or IRI), and the 
tax allowance for corporate equity (ACE). Further funding should come from changes to 
the tax advance percentage rates and from ministerial spending cuts.
4  The public debt
In the Government’s programmes, the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is expected 
to reach 130.9 per cent at the end of this year, should decrease on average by 
3

the 64th Conference on Government Studies, Varenna, 22 September 2018.
10
1.4 percentage points a year over the next three years, coming to 126.7 per cent 
in 2021.
Compared  with  the  current  legislation  scenario,  the  annual  decrease  in 
the  policy  scenario  would  be  about  0.7  points  less,  on  average:  the  rise  in  net 
borrowing (on average 1.3 percentage points a year) would be offset only in part 
by the increased growth in nominal GDP.
The trend of the debt-to-GDP ratio over the next three years assumes a small 
reduction in the Treasury’s liquid balance (of about 0.1 percentage points of GDP 
per  year).  It  is  also  based  on  estimated  revenue  from  disposals  of  assets  of  0.3 
percentage points of GDP per year in 2019 and 2020, a figure that is in line with 
the amount forecast in the planning documents of the last two years.
The Update contains no details of the planned asset disposals. In the last two years 
and in the first nine months of 2018, privatisation receipts have been negligible.
The evolution of the debt-to-GDP ratio depends on the size of the primary 
surplus and the gap between the average cost of the debt and the rate of growth of 
the economy. Movements in interest rates have a considerable effect. Unlike the 
previous  year,  this  year’s  Update  includes  neither  an  analysis  of  the  sensitivity 
of the evolution of the debt-to-GDP ratio to growth and interest rate shocks, nor 
alternative scenarios for the medium term.
Italy’s  public  debt  has  a  high  average  residual  maturity,  more  than  seven 
years, which means that the effect of an increase in interest rates at issue on the 
average cost of the debt will occur gradually. Nevertheless, it can be estimated that 
at current rates in 2021 interest expense will already be about 0.6 percentage points 
of GDP higher than in the projections prepared in April.
In commenting on the DEF in May,4 I had noted that at the interest rates prevailing 
at the time, it would have been possible to bring the debt to below 100 per cent of GDP 
in about ten years, provided that the primary surplus immediately started to converge 
towards  4  per  cent  of  GDP,  absent  market  shocks.  If  we  were  to  repeat  mechanically 
the same exercise using current interest rates and assuming that debt consolidation is 
resumed in 2022, as indicated in the Update, we would find that we would need another

Bank of Italy, Luigi Federico Signorini, before the Chamber of Deputies, Rome, 9 May 2018.
11
seven or eight years, in theory, to obtain the same result. This would risk undermining the 
confidence of savers in the credibility of the debt reduction process.
As the Bank of Italy has pointed out on more than one occasion, the success 
of long-term debt reduction is also dependent on how well the public finances can 
cope with rising expenditure tied to the ageing population. The Update indicates, 
rightly, that the pension reforms introduced in the last 20 years have significantly 
improved both the sustainability and the intergenerational fairness of the Italian 
pension system.
It is critical that we do not lose ground on these two fronts, especially when 
–  as  demonstrated  by  the  European  Commission’s  latest  long-term  age-related 
expenditure projections – the risks to the sustainability of the public finances are 
also increasing due to worsening demographic projections.
 Restoring the Italian economy to a path of sustained economic development is 
a structural matter; it depends on the continuation of the reform process of all those 
aspects of public action and the functioning of the economy and society that affect 
firms’ ability to compete. Much has already been done: gross domestic product, 
while still lower than it was before the crisis, has risen by more than 5 points since 
its 2013 trough; investment has increased by about 15 points; the number of those 
in employment, which has risen by more than 1 million, has hit an all-time high. 
The  productive  fabric  of  the  country  has  strengthened,  especially  in  the  export 
sector;  the  difficulties  encountered  by  the  banking  system  have  been  alleviated 
with the improvement in the real economy and the reduction in non-performing 
loans; the balance of payments has recorded a current account surplus since 2013; 
in June our country’s net debtor position was equal to 3.4 per cent of GDP, almost 
20 percentage points lower than it was in 2013.
There  remain,  however,  large  imbalances  in  the  labour  market,  widespread 
income losses compared with ten years ago, and serious problems of poverty and 
social exclusion. Although the worst of the crisis is now years behind us, there is still 
much to do to place the Italian economy on a stable path to higher growth. Greater 
wealth and job creation is also key to helping those who are most vulnerable.
Public services should be made more efficient, the quality of our human capital 
improved, and competitive mechanisms strengthened.
12
In addition to this, the debt-to-GDP ratio should be lowered decisively. The debt 
is, for Italy, the great multiplier of turbulence. Given its size and the need to service 
each year a significant amount (around €400 billion), the danger of triggering a vicious 
circle between the cost of the debt and its share of GDP, with repercussions on the real 
economy, is ever present. Around two thirds of the debt is currently held by Italian 
citizens and institutions; but this does not insulate it from the laws of the market, 
which seeks out yields and flees from uncertainty. Fluctuations in the value of the debt 
also have an impact on the Italian citizens, households, firms and financial institutions 
that hold it. Ultimately, a significant portion of our savings is tied to the public debt.
A lower valuation of the government bonds held by banks in their portfolios has 
an effect on their capital requirements; above certain limits, it can reduce their ability 
to supply credit to the economy.
The Update envisages providing a significant cyclical boost to the economy by 
increasing the deficit; to achieve this, we have to assume high multipliers, which 
cannot  be  taken  as  given.  But  how  effective  fiscal  policies  are  in  supporting  the 
economy also depends on whether the government’s action is capable of convincing 
savers and the markets to remain confident in the process to consolidate the public 
finances.
Even  assuming  the  full  deployment  of  the  expected  expansionary  effects  of 
the budget, the Update envisages a slower reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio than 
both the current legislation scenario and with respect to the possibilities afforded by 
today’s economic conditions; it postpones the achievement of a balanced budget to 
an unspecified date in the future.
Given the large amount of bonds that the Italian State must periodically place on 
the market, the possibility that financial turbulence can arise, even unexpectedly, calls 
for clarity and certainty in the debt reduction process. Credibility is self-sustaining: 
bolstering the confidence of savers and investors brings down the risk premium on 
Italy’s  sovereign  bonds,  facilitates  the  debt  reduction  process  and  makes  it  more 
secure.
Another matter that deserves attention is the funding of the budgetary provisions. 
When specifying the planned measures, it would be advisable to avoid accompanying 
permanent  expansionary  measures  with  advances  of  revenue,  other  temporary 
funding measures or safeguard clauses of uncertain application.
13
Narrowing  the  growth  gap  with  Europe,  as  stated  in  the  Update,  is  a  key 
objective; it is also necessary to get the debt-to-GDP ratio under control. Higher 
growth and greater social cohesion are not at odds with fiscal discipline. Lasting 
results  can  be  achieved  through  budget  recomposition:  devoting  a  higher  share 
to  productive  investments,  sharing  the  tax  burden  more  equitably,  improving 
the equalisation capacity of public transfers. These results also rely on structural 
interventions to improve the underlying capacity of the Italian economy to post 
higher growth, above and beyond short-term stimuli. Any improvement achieved 
thanks to public intervention in the areas of income and its distribution will be the 
more solid, the more it is rooted in solid funding measures and the more carefully 
it is designed to take account of the incentives to create income and jobs, this being 
the most reliable way to combat the spread of poverty.

outturns  include  reimbursements  of  the  capitalization  tools  issued  by  the  banks  and  underwritten  by  the  MEF  (the 
‘Tremonti/Monti bonds’). –  (2) The data refer to revenues accounted into item 4055 of the State budget (mostly proceeds 
from  the  sale  of  State  shareholdings);  the  GDP  ratios  are  calculated  using  the  GDP  reported  by  Istat  in  the  press 
release  dated  21  September  2018;  the  GDP  for  2018  is  found  in  the  Update  to  the  2018  Economic  and  Financial
