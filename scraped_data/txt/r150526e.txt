  Agustín Carstens: Challenges for emerging economies in the face of 
unconventional monetary policies in advanced economies 
Text of the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Lecture by Mr Agustín Carstens, Governor of the 
Bank  of  Mexico,  at  the  Peterson  Institute  for  International  Economics,  Washington  DC, 
20 April 2015. 
 All the opinions are the responsibility of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the views of Banco de México. 
Thanks to Manuel Ramos Francia, Ana María Aguilar, Alfredo Sordo and Gabriel Cuadra for useful discussions 
and support. 
It is a real pleasure and honor to have the opportunity to deliver the 15th Stavros Niarchos 
Foundation Lecture at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE). In particular, 
I  wish  to  express  my  gratitude  to  Adam  Posen  for  the  invitation.  I  am  sure  that  all  of  you 
present here tonight would agree with me that the PIIE has been since its creation a forum of 
excellence for the analysis and debate of issues related to international finance, trade, the 
international monetary system, and more, with a clear emphasis on exploring and identifying 
policy  options.  The  contribution  of  the  Institute  has  been  particularly  valuable  since  2008, 
when the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) erupted in the United States, rapidly spread to most 
of the rest of advanced economies, and eventually affected the world as a whole. 
 Even though the most critical aspects of the GFC have been overcome – in particular the 
possibility  of  extreme  tail–risk  events  that  would  have  been  disastrous  had  they 
materialized –, the process of recovery has been extremely slow, and it still is vulnerable to 
setbacks. World economic growth continues to be sluggish, and a huge deficit in employment 
creation  persist.  Nevertheless,  the  quest  for  financial  stability  has  shown  more  promising 
results, underpinned by a comprehensive Financial Sector Reform steered by the Financial 
Stability Board (FSB). 
But the aspect that worries me the most about the process of recovery of the world economy 
is  the  fact  that  it  still  depends  heavily  on  the  monetary  policy  stances  in  main  advanced 
economies (AEs) that are not sustainable over the medium and long term. Let me explain. 
Relatively soon after the beginning of the crisis, it became clear that the feasibility in most 
AEs of stimulating growth through fiscal policy came to an end, as debt–to-GDP ratios grew 
very  fast.  Thus,  the  only  stabilization  policy  instrument  left  was  monetary  policy,  and 
therefore  the  main  AEs  central  banks  have  adopted,  at  different  times,  speeds  and  with 
varied  modalities,  unprecentented  expansionary  monetary  policies.  The  Federal  Reserve 
System led the way, followed by the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the European 
Central  Bank  (ECB),  the  latter  two  motivated  also  by  the  growing  risk  of  deflation.  These 
policies  have  engineered  sharp  declines  in  interest  rates  across  the  yield  curve.  The  zero 
lower bound in the policy reference rates became binding in all the above-mentioned cases 
(Figure  1).  In  addition,  forward  guidance  for  the  policy  rates  and  quantitative  easing  (QE) 
have  been  adopted.  As  a  result,  the  balance  sheets  of  AEs  central  banks  have  increased 
sharply (Figure 2).

The overall objective of unconventional monetary policies (UMP) in these AEs has been to 
stimulate  growth  and  employment,  while  inducing  the  convergence  of  inflation  to  each 
countries´ objective. Inflation in most AEs has fallen below their objective, mostly as a result 
of  widespread  unemployment,  large  output  gaps,  reduction  in  commodities  prices,  in 
particular of oil, and more recently in the United States, due to a sharp effective appreciation 
of the US dollar. 
I believe that given the magnitude of the GFC and the policy options available, the UMP have 
been  essential  and  they  have  worked  well so  far.  Economic  recovery  in  the  United  States 
and  in  the  United  Kingdom,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  in  Japan,  have  taken  hold,  and  recent 
figures in the Eurozone have been promising. Inflation expectations and core inflation have 
been moving towards the respective central banks’ objectives. 
Nonetheless, my perception is that it is too early to declare victory. To  begin with, we still 
have to see if the unwinding of those policies can proceed in an orderly fashion, once their 
immediate objectives are met. Once we reach that state of affairs, the unwinding of UMP will 
be unavoidable, given that otherwise they would feed into inflation, and induce higher than 
warranted interest rates and financial instability. This is the reason why I consider that UMP 
are not sustainable over the medium and long term. To assess the risks associated with the 
unwinding of those policies, we have to identify the unintended consequences that they have 
caused. 
The transmission of extraordinary monetary stimulus to higher economic growth was meant 
to work primarily by enticing more risk taking by economic agents. In the case of consumers, 
and in particular as a response to quantitative easing (asset purchase programs by central 
banks),  lower  interest  rates  and  wealth  effects  would  stimulate  their  expenditure.  Another 
important channel that would operate was that lower interest rates, term spreads and credit 
spreads that would result from QE would stimulate real risk taking by firms, that is, QE would 
induce  higher  corporate  investment.  But  investment  has  only  partially  recovered  from  the 
sharp fall in the recession of 2009 – the median decline from a group of AEs and emerging 
markets  economies  (EMEs)  has  been  around  2  ½  percentage  points  of  GDP.  Meanwhile, 
there  has  been  massive  investments  in  financial  instruments  of  all sorts,  both in  local  and 
external  markets,  in  what  has  been  called  “the  search  for  yield”,  which  has  created 
considerable spillover effects of UMP. The crux of the matter is that it seems that “financial 
risk-taking” has been by far more responsive to UMP than “real risk-taking”. 
Several  consequences  have  resulted  from  the  above.  Initially  resources  were  directed  to 
bonds  and  stock  markets  in  AEs,  but  as  the  search  for  yield  led  to  stretched  valuations 
(Figure  3),  investments  in  high-yield  corporate,  and  EMEs  sovereign  and  corporate  debt 
exploded.  These  responses  led  in  turn  to  wider  credit  and  term  spreads  compressions, 
record high-yield debt issuance and deteriorating underwriting standards.

Most of these investments have been intermediated by non-bank financial institutions, such 
as asset management companies, hedge funds and pension and insurance companies.  
A  novel  feature  of  this  episode  of  capital  inflows  to  EMEs  has  been  the  fact  that  a  large 
portion  of  them  have  taken  place  as  purchases  of  government  bonds  denominated  in  the 
domestic currency by non-resident investors (Figure 4). This is an important feature, since it 
eliminates the “Original Sin Syndrome”1 that haunted EMEs for several decades. 
                                                 
1   This term was coined by Barry Eichengreen and Ricardo Hausmann (1999), and refers to the propensity of 
Latin  American  countries  to  borrow  in  foreign  currency  given  that  foreign  interest  rates  were  lower  than 
domestic  ones,  but  disregarding  the  potential  additional  cost  that  could  be  generated  by  local  currency 
depreciation, which happened often in the eighties and nineties in the region.

Massive  capital  inflows  into  EMEs  persisted  for  a  while,  fueled  primarily  by  carry  trades 
explained by ex ante uncovered interest rates arbitrage opportunities (Figure 5). The flows 
promoted  by  the  excess  global  liquidity  created  a  sense  of  exuberance,  which  in  turn 
generated  mispricing  in  some  assets  in  many  EMEs,  meaningful  real  exchange  rate 
appreciations and opened the door for potential sudden capital flow reversals. These factors 
caused concerns among many countries, in particular about the potential of capital flows to: 
a)  induce  a  sharp  decline  in  exports,  given  the  resulting  real  exchange  rate  appreciation; 
b) produce  asset  bubbles  created  by  rapid  credit  expansion,  which  in  turn  could  result  in 
financial  instability;  and  c)  eventually  observing  capital  outflows,  which  also  could  be  a 
source of financial instability. Most EMEs resorted to at least one of the following defensive 
policy  measures:  (i)  the  accumulation  of  international  reserves;  and/or  (ii)  the  adoption  of 
macroprudential policies.

The accumulation of international reserves by EMEs is a phenomenon interesting to analyze 
in detail. Almost two years ago, as he delivered the 12th Stavros Niarchos Foundation Lecture, 
Fred  Bergsten2  said  that  “the  transmission  of  all  monetary  policy  occurs  to  some  extent 
through the exchange markets”. He is absolutely right. Given the sheer size of quantitative 
easing  in  the  United  States,  coupled  with  the  one  implemented  so  far  in  Japan,  it  is  not 
surprising that EMEs domestic currencies suffered sharp appreciations in response. This is 
the  main  reason  that  some  analysts  and  policymakers  have  labeled  QE  as  “competitive 
easing”. In a way, the aggressive accumulation of international reserves by EMEs all the way 
to late 2013 (Figure 6) is at least partially the other side of the coin to “competitive easing”. 
As a matter of fact we might as well call it “competitive reserve accumulation”. In most of 
the cases, I would agree with this practice, given the blunt distorting effects that QE had 
on EMEs. The size of capital flows to this subset of countries was much larger per unit of 
time  than  the  capacity  of  such  countries  to  absorb  them  without  suffering  substantial 
distortions.

Therefore, for most EMEs it has been appropriate to throw some “gravel under the wheels” 
via  international  reserve  accumulation  to  mitigate  some  of  the  negative  externalities  that 
could take place as a result of the sharp real exchange rate appreciation. Even the contained 
appreciation has had real effects, starting with a deterioration of the trade balance, and going 
all  the  way  to  substantially  handicapping  some  sectors  in  a  variety  of  countries,  such  as 
manufacturing in Brazil. We have several other recent examples in this regard.  
Another  important  reason  to  accumulate  reserves  in  the  face  of  QE  is  that  it  might  avoid 
financial  instability  in  the  future.  As  QE  will  be  temporary,  countries  should  prepare 
themselves for the reversals of capital, and one way to do so is by accumulating reserves 
and by building other backstops (Figure 7).  In addition, rapid capital inflows could be used in 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

the recipient economy in such a way that asset price bubbles or rich valuations could result; 
this  is  of  particular  concern  if  such  flows  are  intermediated  by  the  banking  system  of  the 
recipient country and they lead to a real estate bubble, which, as we well know, usually are 
the source of major crisis. The avoidance of this scenario through reserve accumulation has 
been an effective prudential instrument.

Of  course,  in  some  cases  macroprudential  measures  applied  through  the  banking  system 
(like  loan  to  value  or  income  to  debt  limits,  and  the  imposition  of  higher  reserve 
requirements),  could  deliver  the  same  results,  and  several  EMEs  have  followed  this  path. 
Nevertheless,  macroprudential  policies  are  far  less  effective  when  capital  flows  are  not 
channeled through the banking system, as has been the case with recent cross-border flows 
to many EMEs, where market-based financing has been the norm. 
As time passed, a gradual deterioration in some EMEs macrofundamentals, in combination 
with some major events in AEs that periodically switched the risk-on to off, and vice versa, 
(such as the problems with Greece and other countries in the periphery of the Eurozone, the 
possibility  of  a  fiscal  cliff  in  the  United  States,  the  “whatever  it  takes”  statement  by  Mario 
Draghi3) have made capital flows to EMEs increasingly volatile (Figure 8).

In  April/May  2013  the  first  serious  reality  check  for  EMEs  arrived.  At  that  time,  the  global 
financial  cycle  was  more  clearly  transmitted  to  EMEs,  triggered  mostly  by  the  start  of  the 
discussion of monetary policy normalization in the United States, that is the “taper talk”. This, 
together with the correction in commodity prices that has followed the economic slowdown in 
China and in most AEs, invited a reevaluation of EMEs’ prospects.  
The turbulence in EMEs’ financial markets that followed was not homogeneous. The most 
severe turbulence occured in countries with the weakest fundamentals, mostly judged by the 
size of their current account and fiscal deficits. In these cases, sharp depreciations in local 
currencies  took  place,  together  with  disproportionate  increases  in  interest  rates,  and 
plummeting  stock  markets.  National  authorities  reacted  by  intervening  in  the  foreign 
exchange  markets,  facilitating  the  reduction  of  duration  in  investors´  portfolios,  and  more 
importantly,  by  tightening  fiscal  and  monetary  policies.  In  contrast,  many  other  EMEs 
managed  to  sail  through  this  episode  by  reinforcing  their  policy  stance,  and  allowing  the 
exchange and interest rates to make the adjustments, without any market interventions. We 
could say that many EMEs came out strengthened from this period of volatility. 
Financial markets were surprisingly calm in late 2013 and the first half of 2014. The tapering 
of  securities  purchases  by  the  Federal  Reserve  started  in  January  2014  and  proceeded 
without unforeseen consequences. At the same time, the Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC) enhanced the clarity of its forward guidance, creating the expectations of policy rate 
adjustments  until  2015.  In  the  euro  area,  major  concerns  became  evident  about  sluggish 
economic  growth  and  massive  unemployment,  together  with  inflation  rates  substantially 
below  the  ECB  target.  This  generated  the  expectation  of  significant  additional  monetary 
policy easing by the ECB. Owing to these events, together with the reactivation of the search 
for yield, credit spreads compressed and their dispersion fell to unusually low levels, volatility 
in all asset classes was supressed and capital flows seemed to recover. 
But market conditions started to change considerably for the worse at the beginning of the 
second half of 2014. Again, events in the United States and the Eurozone were important

triggers.  As  the  QE  tapering  was  coming  to  an  end  in  the  United  States,  widespread 
speculation about potential dates and modalities of the policy rate lift-off from the zero lower 
bound became destabilizing, leading to higher US rates. At the same time, both the Bank of 
Japan and the ECB took sequential steps towards additional monetary easing. Worth noting 
was  the  fact  that  in  January  of  2015  the  ECB  initiated  a  fully-fledged  QE  program.  The 
combination  of  the  expectation  of  the  normalization  of  US  monetary  policy,  with  additional 
easing  in  the  Eurozone  and  Japan,  have  established  conditions  for  euro  and  yen  carry 
trades, as the US offers higher yields and an appreciating currency, while low rates make the 
euro  and  the  yen  attractive  funding  currencies.  This  process  feeds  into  itself,  as  the  flows 
that it triggers have reinforced the appreciation of the US dollar. Thus it is not surprising that 
the US dollar effective appreciation in the 9-month span from July, 2014 to today has been 
the largest since 1973 (Figure 9).

When the United States implemented QE, cross border flows increased to many EMEs. But 
now,  with  the  Eurozone  and  Japanese  QE  combined  with  the  expectation  of  an  imminent 
Fed tightening, together with stronger economic growth in the US even with respect to many 
EMEs,  flows  are  going  towards  the  United  States,  implying  tighter  external  financial 
conditions for EMEs.

In  addition,  also  since  mid-2014  we  have  witness  a  sharp  decrease  in  commodity  prices, 
especially in oil, which reflects protracted low growth in the world economy, the appreciation 
of  the  US  dollar  and  particular  circumstances  in  specific  markets.  So  what  we  have  seen 
recently in EMEs are capital outflows (Figure 10) and continued exchange rate depreciation 
(Figure  11),  caused  to  a  large  extent  by  the  strengthening  of  the  dollar  and  the  sharp 
collapse in commodity prices (Figure 12).4

From the above, I hope that I have made the case that the initiation of the unwinding of the 
UMP  in  the  United  States,  certainly  without  being  the  sole  contributor,  has  induced  a 
noticeable increase in volatility in financial markets, in particular in EMEs. In a way this could 
be surprising, since the fact that the Fed is in a position to contemplate the full normalization 
of  its  monetary  policy  stance  signals  that  the  economic  recovery  has  almost  been 
consolidated in the context of price stability. This constitutes really good news for the United 
States, EMEs and the world as a whole. But my fear is that during this transition period the 
overextension of “financial risk-taking” is overwhelming the usual market responses. Let me 
illustrate this with a simple example. In the pre-crisis period, good figures in the US nonfarm 
payroll data generated an appreciation in EMEs currencies, given that a strong US economy 
meant  a  positive  impulse  for  their  exports.  In  the  post-crisis  period,  and  more  markedly  in 
recent  times,  a  positive  surprise  in  US  payroll  data  generates  depreciations  of  EMEs 
currencies, given that such surprises makes market participants anticipate an earlier lift-off in 
the US police reference rate (Figure 13)!

In  light  of  the  complex  external  environment  described  above,  central  banks  in  EMEs  are 
currently facing significant challenges with respect to the conduction of monetary policy. On 
the  one  hand,  regarding  domestic  conditions,  economic  activity  has  lost  momentum  and 
growth  prospects  have  been  revised  downward.  Furthermore,  low  energy  prices  have  put 
also downward pressure on inflation. On the other hand, with respect to external factors, the 
imminent normalization of monetary conditions in the US have already triggered periods of 
financial turbulence and, accordingly, EMEs have experienced exchange rate depreciations, 
resulting oftentimes in higher inflation expectations.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 13
  
 
In  this  scenario,  central  banks  in  EMEs  have  to  weigh  both  internal  and  external 
determinants  of  inflation,  since  they  can  point  towards  opposite  policy  actions.  Thus,  the 
assessment of the appropriate monetary policy stance has become a more difficult task. 
In  order  to  determine  to  what  extent  central  banks  in  small  and  open  economies  react  to 
changes in the monetary policy stance in the US, I estimated two specifications for the Taylor 
Rule for a number of economies. The first one corresponds to a traditional (or conventional) 
Taylor  Rule  where  central  banks  take  into  account  the  output  and  the  inflation  gaps  when 
setting the policy rate. Then, I augment the Taylor Rule with the US policy rate and also with 
the  so-called  shadow  policy  rate  from  2008  onwards.  The  shadow  rate  accounts  for  the 
effects of QE once the policy rate reached the zero lower bound, and is taken from the work 
of  Wu  and  Xia  (2014).  In  sum,  the  shadow  rate  is  an  indicator  of  the  degree  of  monetary 
policy easing. 
The estimations show that in most cases, including Mexico, monetary conditions in the US 
have a statistically significant effect on EMEs policy rates (see Appendix).  
That  is,  in  response  to  a  more  accommodative  monetary  policy  stance  in  the  US,  central 
banks in EMEs have reduced their policy rate. This means that the inflation and output gaps 
do not capture all the impact of external events on the domestic economy and, accordingly, 
central banks react to the US monetary conditions (Figure 14 for the case of México). As Rey 
(2013) has suggested, the U.S. monetary policy is a key determinant of the so-called global 
financial cycle. In turn, monetary authorities in EMEs care about the impact of such cycle on 
their  domestic  economies  and,  accordingly,  take  into  account  the  evolution  of  monetary 
conditions in the US when assessing their appropriate monetary policy stance. This situation 
seems to have intensified after the GFC.

Looking ahead, given the imminent normalization of monetary conditions in the US, it could 
be  expected  that  central  banks  in  EMEs  will  increase  their  policy  rates  as  the  Federal 
Reserve  adjust  upwards  the  federal  funds  rate.  This  might  happen  even  if  the  domestic 
economic conditions do not justify a policy rate increase. Although the baseline scenario is 
one of a gradual and orderly normalization of US monetary conditions, episodes of financial 
turbulence cannot be discarded. Under these circumstances, authorities might not only need 
to increase their policy rate, but also might be forced to intervene in key financial markets, 
namely the forex and money markets, in the later case to facilitate the adjustment of duration 
in  portfolios  of  domestic  sovereign  securities.  These  unorthodox  market  intervention  by 
central  banks  would  be  pertinent  if,  as  it  is  likely,  market  liquidity  dries  up  during  stress 
episodes. Precisely for this reason, I have mentioned the need for EMEs to have additional 
backstops, for example the IMF´s Flexible Credit Line (FCL). 
The fact that EMEs would have to adjust their monetary policy rate due to external conditions 
(i.e. Federal Reserve policy adjustments), overwhelming domestic ones (inflation and growth 
gaps), makes it obvious that they cannot depend solely on monetary policy to achieve the 
ultimate  policy  goal,  which  is  to  reach  faster  and  sustainable  growth  and  simultaneously 
consolidate financial stability. In this sense macro-relevant structural reforms, together with 
strong fundamentals, becomes of the essence. This is the path that Mexico has followed. 
 Let me conclude with a brief commentary on the International Monetary System (IMS). It is 
fair to say that the IMS is in transition and much remains to be done to make it more stable 
and adapt it to the challenges of the twenty-first century. 
The global economy is becoming more multi-polar and interconnected, underpinned by rapid 
structural  growth  in  large  EMEs.  Dynamic  EMEs  generally  exhibit  lower  levels  of  financial 
development  and  global  integration than  their  more  advanced  peers,  suggesting scope  for 
catch-up.  This  transition  raises  challenges  and  provides  opportunities,  and  how  it  will  take 
place has important implications for financial stability and growth, and for the architecture of 
the IMS and its efficacy. 
Despite some reforms after the GFC, question marks remain about the resilience of the IMS. 
Incremental steps have been taken to strengthen policy collaboration, monitor and manage 
capital flows, and broaden the financial safety net. However, more fundamental IMS reforms 
to address sources of instability, have remained on a backburner. A key concern, developed 
in  my  presentation,  has  been  that  monetary  policy  decisions  by  AEs  can  create  large 
spillovers, especially for EMEs, so some form of coordination is urgently needed.  
The  international  community  has  an  opportunity  to  facilitate  and  shape  a  virtuous  further 
integration of major EMEs into the global economy, while in the process addressing some 
long-standing weaknesses of the IMS. These can be achieved by: 
– 
First:  Providing  incentives  and  support  for  EMEs  to  join  existing  governance 
structures,  including  by  adapting  those  structures  to  their  needs  and  ensuring  fair 
representation,  which  would  help  prevent  fragmentation  and  duplication,  and 
promote deeper, more substantive global policy dialogue.  
Second:  Orderly,  well-sequenced  financial  deepening  and  opening  in  key  EMEs 
could deliver substantial welfare gains for these countries, along with positive global 
spillovers  and  stability  gains  for  the  IMS,  as  deeper  domestic  financial  markets 
would  promote  domestic  demand,  facilitate  greater  reliance  on  exchange  rates  to 
achieve  external  adjustment  and  thereby  help  reduce  global  imbalances,  and 
improve  the  ability  to  cope  with  capital  flow  volatility.  Increased  opportunities  for 
asset  diversification,  both  domestically  and  at  the  global  level,  would  provide 
additional welfare gains.  
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 15
   
 
Third: Finally, further broad efforts are needed to strengthen and close gaps in the 
global financial safety net, and avoid the need for costly and distortionary reserves 
accumulation. Certainly, this implies reaching the point of full implementation of the 
2010  Governance  Reforms  at  the  IMF,  which  would  increase  its  lending  capacity 
based on quotas, and enhance the voice and representation of EMEs. This would 
enrich  the  IMF´s  credibility,  efficiency  and  legitimacy,  placing  the  institution  in  a 
stronger position to improve the functioning of the IMS. 
Thank you very much.

   Technical appendix  
An  econometric  exercise  is  conducted  in  order  to  analyze  the  main  determinants  of  policy 
rates  in  small  and  open  economies.  In  particular,  the  purpose  is  to  assess  to  what  extent 
central  banks  in these  economies  react  to changes  in  the U.S.  monetary  policy  stance.  In 
order  to  address  this  issue,  two  specifications  for  the  Taylor  rule  are  estimated  for 
11 economies.5  Given  the  availability  of  data,  the  sample  period  for  this  analysis  is  from 
January 2000 to February 2015.6  
First,  a  traditional  Taylor  rule  is  estimated  for  these  economies.  In  this  specification  the 
central  bank  reacts  to  deviations  of  the  output  from  its  potential  level  (output  gap)  and 
inflation from its target level (inflation gap) when setting the policy rate: 
 
 
(cid:2191)(cid:2202)=(cid:3435)(cid:2200)∗+(cid:2250)∗+(cid:2236)(cid:2778)((cid:2250)(cid:2202)(cid:2185)(cid:2197)(cid:2200)(cid:2187)−(cid:2250)∗)+(cid:2236)(cid:2779)(cid:2189)(cid:2183)(cid:2198)(cid:2202)(cid:2163)(cid:2160)(cid:2172)(cid:3439)((cid:2778)−(cid:2251))+(cid:2251)(cid:2191)(cid:2202)(cid:2879)(cid:2778) 
Where (cid:1861)(cid:3047)  represents  the  policy  rate, (cid:1870)∗  the  neutral  real  interest  rate  (an  interest  rate 
consistent with the inflation rate being at its target and an output gap equal to zero), (cid:2024)(cid:3047) the 
inflation rate, (cid:2024)∗ the inflation target and (cid:1859)(cid:1853)(cid:1868)(cid:3047)(cid:3008)(cid:3005)(cid:3017) the output gap. In addition, (cid:2025) is a parameter 
(cid:2191)(cid:2202)=(cid:3435)(cid:2200)∗+(cid:2250)∗+(cid:2236)(cid:2778)((cid:2250)(cid:2202)(cid:2185)(cid:2197)(cid:2200)(cid:2187)−(cid:2250)∗)+(cid:2236)(cid:2779)(cid:2189)(cid:2183)(cid:2198)(cid:2202)(cid:2163)(cid:2160)(cid:2172)+(cid:2236)(cid:2780)(cid:2191)(cid:2202)(cid:2177)(cid:2175)(cid:3439)((cid:2778)−(cid:2251))+(cid:2251)(cid:2191)(cid:2202)(cid:2879)(cid:2778) 
Where (cid:1861)(cid:3047)(cid:3022)(cid:3020) denotes the U.S. policy rate and the shadow policy rate from 2008 onwards. The 
that represents the tendency of central banks to smooth adjustments in its interest rate.  
Second, the above specification is augmented with an indicator of the U.S. monetary policy 
stance (Non-conventional Taylor Rule).  
 
 
latter is taken from Wu and Xia (2014) and is an indicator of the monetary policy conditions 
that summarizes the level of monetary policy easing in the U.S. In this setting, such indicator 
takes into account the impact of the unconventional monetary policies implemented by the 
Fed once the federal fund rate reached the zero lower bound. 
Table 1 shows the results of the first specification (Conventional Taylor Rule). The first and 
second columns correspond to the coefficients associated to the inflation gap and the output 
gap, respectively.  
                                                 
5   The countries considered for this analysis  are: Canada,  Czech Republic, euro zone, Israel, Korea, Mexico, 
New Zealand, Norway, Poland, South Africa and Thailand. 
6   For the countries that hit the zero lower bound in this period – Euro Zone, Czech Republic and Israel –, the 
sample period ends when the ZLB is reached. The data for inflation and policy rate was retrieved from Haver 
Analytics.  The  output  gap  was  estimated  using  the  Hodrick-Prescott  filter  with  tail  correction.  The  inflation 
target is the official for each countries’ central bank. The Fed Funds Shadow Rate was taken from an updated 
database of Wu and Xia’s (2014) work from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta webpage.

* significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%. The numbers in blue indicate that in those countries the U.S.

statistically  significant  effect  on  EMEs  policy  rates.  In  other  words,  in  response  to  a  more 
accommodative  monetary  policy  stance  in  the  U.S.,  central  banks  in  the  set  of  countries 
considered in the analysis end to reduce their policy rates.
