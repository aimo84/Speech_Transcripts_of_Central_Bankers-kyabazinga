José De Gregorio: The world economy, foreign exchange tensions, and 
recent monetary policy making in Chile 
Keynote  address  by  Mr  José  De  Gregorio,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  at  the 
Monetary Club of Universidad Finis Terrae, Santiago, 20 May 2011. 
 Abstract 
This presentation discusses risks and tensions that have emerged in the global economy due 
to  the  ongoing  process  of  world  economic  recovery  and  its  implications  on  the  Chilean 
economy. It reviews the decoupling of emerging economies from developed ones in terms of 
growth,  the  difficulties  endured  by  developed  economies  to  boost  their  feeble  recovery, 
Europe’s  public  debt  issues,  the  high  commodity  prices  and  symptoms  of  overheating  in 
some emerging markets. This scenario has pushed emerging economies’ exchange rates to 
their  lowest  levels  of  the  past  decade.  It  stands  out  that,  although  an  important  step  to 
change  the  composition  of  world  demand,  it  has  created  tensions  and  in  some  cases  has 
prompted  the  adoption  of  policies  to  mitigate  exchange  rate  adjustments.  Capital  inflows 
have  added  pressure  to  the  exchange  rate  discussion  in  some  emerging  economies  and 
might  favor  an  unhealthy  increase  in  lending  and  incubate  financial  fragilities.  Chile’s  last 
forex  intervention  is  mentioned.  The  differences  in  capital  flows  between  Chile  and  other 
countries  and  episodes  of  substantial  flows  into  emerging  economies  are  described, 
emphasizing that large capital outflows from Chile have created a negative net balance. It is 
also  suggested  that  the  current  level  of  the  neutral  MPR  is  probably  lower  than  previous 
estimates, influenced by the low international interest rates. 
Thank you for inviting me to present at the Monetary Club of Universidad Finis Terrae. This is 
a  good  opportunity  to  review  some  recent  developments  in  the  Chilean  economy,  in 
particular  the  behavior  of  the  exchange  rate,  the  forex  intervention  under  way,  and  our 
monetary policy decisions. But before diving into these issues, let me take a look at some 
important  elements  shaping  the  international  scenario,  which  is  where  the  main  risks  and 
tensions facing our economy originated. 
The international economy 
The global economy is leaving the Great Recession behind. Its recovery, however, has been 
heterogeneous  and  is  subject  to  risks.  The  developed  world  still  hasn’t  fully  overcome  the 
negative effects of the crisis, while emerging markets are currently in a strong growth path. 
Despite they did not commit the excesses of their advanced counterparts; they suffered the 
effects of the crisis. Overall, the magnitude of the impact on growth in emerging economies 
was  milder  than  it  could  have  been  expected  based  on  recent  history,  and  emerging 
economies were even able to recover quickly and strongly (figure 1). 
The good performance of emerging economies is grounded on their macroeconomic policy 
schemes. These have evolved and improved over time, partly because lessons have been 
learned  from  numerous  previous  shocks,  which  originated  in  macroeconomic  and  financial 
imbalances. These schemes pursue low, stable inflation, healthy public finances, strong and 
well regulated financial systems and realistic exchange rates. Of course policies vary from 
one  country  to  another,  but  their  basic  principles  are  shared.  In  Chile,  a  fiscal  policy  that 
saves during good times, an autonomous central bank that conducts monetary policy under 
an inflation targeting regime and a floating exchange rate, were key elements to successfully 
work its way out of the crisis. Furthermore, the country has a solid, well regulated financial 
system that does not allow for many of the operations that dragged some economies to their 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

troubled present-day situation. A traditional banking model dominates the banking industry, 
where a strong base of deposits, both personal and institutional, permits to finance mainly 
credits. 
Before the crisis, a lot was said about the decoupling of emerging economies’ growth path 
from that of developed countries. This idea, which gained momentum in 2007 and 2008, was 
seriously questioned during the disaster because, as I said, no one was spared its effects. In 
hindsight,  however,  we  can  say  that  there  actually  was  a  decoupling.  It  is  true  that  in  a 
globalized  world  commercial  and  financial  intertwining  does  not  allow  the  economies  to 
isolate themselves from the global cycle, but the performance of emerging markets is living 
proof that mitigating the negative consequences from the external cycle can be done. In fact, 
it is hard to find another episode where the developed world suffered a severe recession that 
was  not  magnified  in  developing  countries.  This  is  especially  relevant  in  Latin  America 
(figure 2). 
The developed economies face a different scenario. They are having important doubts about 
whether  their  fiscal  situation  will  be  sustainable.  Large  expansions  of  fiscal  expenditure 
before the crisis and the implementation of unprecedented stimulus packages to cope with it 
threw  their  debt  levels  very  high.  Today  they  have  no  further  room  to  continue  increasing 
public spending and, even worse, they need to make substantial adjustments that are difficult 
to implement in such a weak economic situation. The cases of the United States and Japan 
are good examples. Add to this what is happening in peripheral European economies, the 
adjustments that are needed and the financial tensions this creates. What the founders of the 
euro had in mind early on was that the economies in Europe, particularly in the south, would 
adopt  sound  macroeconomic  policies  following  in  the  steps  of  Germany.  Nonetheless,  it 
seems that some economies, such as Greece, only took advantage of the low risk premiums, 
over-borrowing  and  creating  a  deficit  way  bigger  than  set  forth  in  the Stability  and  Growth 
Pact.  The  consequence  was  extreme  financial  vulnerability  that  is  proving  very  difficult  to 
resolve today. 
For the time being, risks seem to be well contained, but the lack of credibility of the markets 
has resulted in some agents speculating with the possibility of some member country being 
discharged from the Eurozone. This seems implausible, as it would trigger a major financial 
crisis, a risk that policy makers in Europe are certainly aware of. It can be discussed at length 
if it was a good idea to let one or another country in, but once officially a member and in a 
situation as frail as it is today, the decision becomes irreversible.  
At any rate, public debt troubles in Europe are quite complex and call for a global, permanent 
solution.  According  to  the  forecasts  contained  in  the  third  review  of  Greece’s  stand-by 
agreement with the IMF, from now to 2020 Greece must generate a primary fiscal surplus of 
6% of GDP per year. Thus it could take its public debt from its present-day levels of around 
1.5 times its GDP to 1.3 times. This is a major adjustment if we consider that in 2008 the 
country posted a primary deficit of 4.5% of GDP, all this under the assumption that it will pay 
an interest rate between 6 and 7%, and the interest rate is today around 16%. Certainly, if 
the rates don’t go down it will be hard for Greece to recover easy access to private credit 
markets,  as  hard  as  obtaining  permanent  funding  by  official  agencies.  From  these  cross-
roads,  Greece  will  have  to  find  new  permanent  solutions  that  allow  it  to  return  to  fiscal 
solvency and distribute the losses without jeopardizing financial stability. 
Another  complex  aspect  of  the  situation  of  developed  economies  is  their  weak  recovery. 
Although  their  financial  systems  and  economic  activity  have  begun  picking  up,  they  have 
been  unable  to  significantly  reduce  their  high  unemployment  rates  and  their  large  output 
gaps  (figure  3).  In  addition,  growth  prospects  are  poor  and,  as  we  have  seen  in  recent 
weeks,  each  piece  of  information  that  is  disclosed  may  put  substantial  volatility  on  the 
market’s evaluation of the strength of the economic recovery. 
Furthermore,  their  financial  fragility  hinders  the  possibility  of  a  strong  come  back.  The 
financial situation of households and governments is complex because of their high degree 
2

of indebtedness. Therefore, it is unlikely that their domestic demands will become a source of 
output expansion. Thus, the basis for faster growth lies, for now, on the demand from the rest 
of the world. Their weak currencies are consistent with this. In this scenario, another paradox 
arises.  Germany,  the  strongest  economy  in  the  European  Union,  whose  example  the 
peripheral countries should follow, has been one of the biggest winners in this conjuncture. 
Its  fiscal  rigor  and  productive  strength  as  one  of  the  world’s  greatest  suppliers  of  capital 
goods have been boosted by a relatively weak euro. If Germany did not share the common 
currency, the Deutschmark would be without a doubt the strongest in the world, quite above 
the equivalent of 1.4 US dollars per euro. Belonging to a fragile monetary union has given it 
the  benefits  of  a  relatively  weak  currency,  which  has  been  an  important  factor  of  its  fast 
expansion.  
To  blend  more  ingredients  into  the  world  economic  cocktail,  again  we  face  a  substantial 
increase in commodity prices. As usual, it can be attributed to various factors. One is the fast 
growth of emerging economies and the subsequent increase in demand. Add to this, among 
others, climate elements that have hindered the production of foods, and geopolitical risks 
that have pushed up the oil price. These high prices, combined with the fact that emerging 
economies are near their potential growth level, some with clear signs of overheating, both 
actual  and  expected  inflation  have  risen  all  over  the  world.  Several  emerging  economies, 
Chile  among  them,  have  withdrawn  monetary  stimulus  as  a  response  to  this  cycle.  In 
contrast, developed economies, with a timid recovery, have not only sustained their ongoing 
monetary  packages  but  are  expected  to  keep  them  in  place  for  a  while.  This  mixture  of 
monetary policy imbalances, high commodity prices, and good growth prospects in emerging 
economies have created tensions in exchange rates and capital flows, two issues I will refer 
to now. 
The exchange rate and capital flows 
Before  the  financial  crisis  hit,  some  developed  economies,  particularly  the  United  States, 
were  accumulating  big  deficits  in  their  current  accounts.  This  excess  spending  was  being 
financed by surpluses in emerging markets, primarily China with its high saving rates, and 
oil-exporting economies (figure 4). 
Global  imbalances  were  an  important  factor  in  the  crisis.  This  was  not  uncommon  for 
emerging economies: low saving rates, large current-account deficits and borrowing used to 
finance unsustainable consumption or fiscal expansions. This time around, the US strongly 
increased  fiscal  expenditure  and  borrowing,  which  was  used  to  finance  the  purchase  of 
overpriced housing. As we now know, and warned insistently before the crisis burst, this mix 
was bound to lead to severe adjustments, sooner or later. 
High  terms  of  trade,  capital  inflows  and  growth  rates  have  resulted  in  exchange  rate 
appreciations  in  most  emerging  and  oil-exporting  economies  (figure  5).  In  real  terms,  the 
current  level  of  the  exchange  rate  is  at  its  lowest  in  the  past  decade  in  most  emerging 
economies  (figure  6).  Vigorous  economic  growth  in  these  economies  means  also  strong 
currencies, while the opposite is true in developed countries. 
As  I  said  before,  the  high  indebtedness  of  developed  economies  holds  back  domestic 
demand growth. Meanwhile, in emerging economies domestic demand growth is thwarted by 
constraints in domestic supply, which require redirecting purchases towards imported goods. 
The adjustment of the global economy calls for a change in demand composition, and the 
exchange  rate  adjustments  works  in  that  direction.  It  is  logical  to  expect  that  once  the 
developed economies recover their strength, their currencies will follow suit. The transition 
may  take  some  time,  however.  Although  the  adjustment  is  good  for  the  world  economy,  it 
entails tensions that may require exceptional policies. 
Thus,  several  emerging  economies,  Chile  included,  have  taken  action  to  moderate  the 
exchange rate adjustment. However, due to the forces that underlie it, it is evident that this

trend can be mitigated but not reversed by just a unilateral measure. In January, the CBC 
launched a substantial process of reserve hoarding, by announcing the purchase of 12 billion 
dollars, the equivalent of around 5 points of GDP, the largest since the mid-1990s (figure 7). 
This  intervention  is  sterilized,  that  is,  the  pesos  issued  to  buy  the  dollars  are  withdrawn 
through  debt  issuance.  Not  doing  this  would  mean  that  the  increase  in  liquidity  would  be 
inconsistent  with  monetary  policy,  which  would  then  be  oriented  to  a  forex  objective  and 
would divert away from its inflation target. I don’t need to explain why this would be terribly 
damaging to our economy. 
The purpose of the intervention is twofold. On the one hand, it allows having more reserves 
which,  despite  their  costs,  are  a  good  hedge  against  sharp  movements  in  capital  flows. 
Although most economies did not significantly deplete their reserves during the crisis, their 
sole existence prevents destabilizing capital movements from occurring. On the other hand, 
the forex intervention mitigates exchange rate adjustments. As we have said before, without 
the intervention the peso would have appreciated further. Still, it is worth pointing out that the 
appreciation  of  the  Chilean  peso  is  not  so  different  from  that  of  the  currencies  of  a  large 
group  of  emerging  or  commodity-exporting  economies,  whether  they  have  intervened  their 
exchange rates or not. 
Let  me  insist  that  the  forex  intervention  has  only  transitory  effects.  It  cannot  permanently 
modify an economy’s competitive position. This can only be made with policies that affect the 
real side of the economy. Monetary or forex measures can only have a temporary influence. 
The  impact  of  a  sterilized  exchange  rate  intervention  occurs  via  the  currency  portfolio 
composition.  Because  external  and  internal  financial  assets  are  not  perfect  substitutes, 
changes in their relative supply have an initial effect on prices, which then fades over time. 
The IMF’s latest Regional Economic Outlook for the Western Hemisphere presents estimates 
showing that interventions reduce the rate of currency appreciation. Additionally, it indicates 
that the effects are milder in more financially open economies, and shows that rule-based or 
discretional interventions have similar effects. Ours is rule-based, in order not to lose control 
over our monetary policy. As proven by this evidence, the effects would not be so different if 
our intervention had been arbitrary. This comes as no surprise, since the effects depend on 
both the amount of the intervention and the composition of the currency portfolios. 
It has called the attention of many people that a measure similar to that of 2008 has caused 
a different behavior of the exchange rate. I don’t need to say that the combination of events 
has also been different, especially abroad. Back then the world economy was headed to a 
severe crisis and risk aversion was growing. This eroded asset value in emerging economies 
and strengthened the dollar. Copper prices and terms of trade began to decline. Today the 
picture is quite different: the dollar is weaker than ever and the copper price has remained 
very high, and is forecast to stay near its present levels for some time (figure 8). 
Another  issue  regarding  exchange  rate’s  discussion  has  to  do  with  the  effects  of  capital 
flows.  Several  emerging  economies  have  seen  their  capital  inflows  increasing,  which  has 
added pressure on their currencies. It is worth noting, however, that this phenomenon is not 
generalized,  because  current-account  deficits have  remained  fairly  bounded.  In  the  overall 
group of emerging economies, capital inflows are today close to where they were during mid-
1990s,  and  certainly  below  the  levels  of  2006–2008.  However,  outflows  from  these 
economies largely exceed those of the 1990s, resulting in a near-zero net balance (figure 9).  
Chile is not so different, with even negative net balances (figure 10). Besides, the structural 
conditions  of  our  economy  and  the  policy  framework  are  not  those  of  the  1990s.  For 
instance,  interest  rates  paid  on  indexed  Central  Bank  instruments  are  now  less  than  half 
(figure  11).  The  opportunity  of  high  short-term  returns,  that  are  normally  associated  with 
massive flows of this kind of capital, is probably not so obvious anymore in our economy.  
The  possibility  that  increased  capital  flows  may  stimulate  unhealthy  growth  in  lending  is 
another cause for concern. The data do not show for the moment that credit is growing fast. 
It is actually on a flatter slope than it was in the 1990s and that of other emerging economies 
4

that have adopted measures to control capital inflows (figure 12). Still, it is important to be on 
the watch for excess flows that might incubate financial fragilities and exacerbate economic 
cycles, in which case it could be necessary to review financial regulations in place to avert 
any costly imbalances. 
Recent monetary policy decisions 
The  scenario  outlined  in  the  latest  Monetary  Policy  Report  assumes  that  in  the  coming 
quarters the Chilean economy will grow in line with its potential. This will allow trend inflation, 
today  in  bounded  levels,  to  converge  and  remain  around  the  3%  target  in  the  coming 
quarters. To achieve this objective, we have withdrawn some monetary stimulus, bringing the 
monetary policy interest rate (MPR) closer to the neutral range. 
Although this is the baseline scenario, the Report also indicated that inflation (and growth) 
risks  were  biased  upward.  For  inflation,  arguments  were  based  on  the  combination  of 
adverse supply shocks in energy and foodstuffs, the closing of output gaps and the strong 
dynamism of the domestic demand.  
Some  of  the  aforesaid  risks  have  eased.  Private  inflation  expectations  have  moderated, 
consistently  with  MPR  adjustments  and  the  recent  decline  in  oil  prices  and  other 
commodities (figure 13). Anyway, commodity markets remain volatile, so it is premature to 
evaluate  at  what  level  international  prices  will  settle.  Nor  can  we  rule  out  that  the  pass-
through  of  previous  rises  in  world  prices  to  domestic  ones,  especially  for  foodstuffs,  may 
continue.  
Other risks have not changed materially. Incoming news confirm a scenario of very dynamic 
domestic  demand,  particularly  for  consumption,  and  employment  (figure  14).  Also  wage 
growth  has  speeded  up  and  credit  is  recovering  fast.  The  domestic  economy  is  growing 
strongly and output gaps are closed. Nonetheless, it is still early to predict an overheating. 
Actually, the various core inflation measures are still below 3% (figure 15). Output is near full 
capacity and, mirroring the rest of emerging economies, excess domestic demand is being 
redirected  to  imports.  The  current  account  still  shows  a  surplus,  largely  because  of  good 
export  prices,  but  also  because  of  steadily  increasing  volume  sales  abroad.  Furthermore, 
monetary  policy  works  with  a  lag,  so  it  is  likely  that  the  full  effects  of  the  450-basis-point 
increase in the MPR since June of last year will not be seen for some time. The information 
we will be getting in the coming months will give us a better sense of the magnitude of these 
effects.  
Overall, the negative implications of these risks materializing led us to speed up the pace of 
monetary policy normalization in the past few months. Last week we actually raised the MPR 
by  50  basis  points  to  5%.  Although  the  median  of  market  expectations  was  foreseeing  a 
somewhat smaller increase, we acted preventively to hold down the dynamism of domestic 
demand  and  the  propagation  of  adverse  supply  shocks.  Now  that  the  MPR  is  at  5%,  it  is 
approaching the range that has historically been thought of as neutral. Still, a high degree of 
uncertainty surrounds the true neutral interest rate. 
There are many definitions and methodologies to determine what would be the interest rate 
consistent with inflation being at the target and the economy operating at full capacity.  
Although this is not the moment to get involved in a lengthy discussion over the level of the 
neutral rate, I think some observations are in order. On the one hand, the neutral rate is not a 
fixed number. It changes with the state of the economy and can even fluctuate in the short 
run. On the other hand, in an open economy the neutral interest rate depends not only on 
domestic factors such as the long-term growth rate, but also on external variables. The world 
is going through a period of low interest rates and in the short term the neutral interest rate is 
likely to be somewhat below previous estimates (figure 16).

I also want to point out that the objective of monetary policy conduct is not to attain a neutral 
rate,  whatever  its  level  is.  The  monetary  policy  interest  rate  (MPR)  fluctuates  around  this 
neutral  rate  in  order  for  the  monetary  impulse  to  be  consistent  with  achieving  the  target. 
Accordingly, just as there are periods during which the MPR is below the neutral level, there 
are times when it is above. This is consistent with economic activity fluctuating around its full 
capacity level, going from periods of capacity under-utilization to periods of over-utilization. 
So the maximum level the MPR will ultimately reach and when this will happen in the current 
cycle is something the CBC Board will be analyzing as events unfold. 
This year to date, a 200 basis point increase has already accumulated in the MPR and we 
believe further increases will be needed. The magnitude and timing of these increases will 
respond to incoming data, risks and their implications for inflationary prospects, taking into 
account the lags that are inherent to monetary policy. Thus, no scenario can be ruled out. It 
is  likely  that  in  the  coming  meetings  the  magnitude  of  the  correction  will  be  reduced  and 
there may even be pauses. Likewise, although today it seems less likely, it can also happen 
that  the  recent  pace  is  maintained  if  inflationary  risks  so  recommend.  In  any  case,  there 
seems  to  be  consensus  in  market  expectations  that  smaller  adjustments  will  be  required 
going  forward.  Actually,  most  forecasts  place  the  MPR  around  6%  at  the  end  of  this  year 
(figure 17). 
Conclusions 
The  last  several  years  have  been  very  complex.  Policy  makers  have  faced  probably  the 
greatest  challenges  in  decades.  Swings  in  economic  activity,  inflation  and  expectations, 
among many other variables, have been marked in unprecedented ways.  
Chile’s macroeconomic policy framework has given proof of its flexibility and effectiveness, 
succeeding in mitigating and overcoming the effects of the world crisis. Today we face new, 
significant  challenges.  The  economy  must  continue  on  a  growth  path  consistent  with  its 
capacity, while the inflation trend must be aligned with the target. Moreover, the asymmetric 
pace of growth between the developed and emerging economies brings along exchange rate 
tensions that subject us to new trials. 
We face a complex scenario. Inflation has proceeded in line with the target, although, as we 
have been saying, it may cross over the upper bound of our tolerance range because of the 
strength of the world price hikes for oil and foodstuffs.  
It is important to limit the unwanted propagation of these shocks to other prices. Accordingly, 
the Bank has quickly come to the scene, making sure that no inflationary pressures incubate 
that  might  compromise  the  fulfillment  of  the  objective  of  low,  stable  inflation.  We  have 
withdrawn the strong impulse that monetary policy brought in 2009–2010. We estimate that 
the MPR will have to be raised further in the coming months, but by how much and exactly 
when  will  depend  on  the  implications  of  incoming  data,  without  ruling  out  any  scenario 
a priori. As always, the Board will guide its decisions to ensure that inflation remains low and 
stable, which is the best contribution that the Central Bank of Chile can make to the country’s 
development. 
Thank you.
