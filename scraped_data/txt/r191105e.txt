Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy 
Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Nagoya 
Haruhiko Kuroda 
Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
Introduction 
It is my great pleasure to have the opportunity today to exchange views with a distinguished 
gathering  of  business  leaders  in  the  Chubu  region.  I  would  like  to  take  this  chance  to 
express  my  sincerest  gratitude  for  your  cooperation  with  various  activities  of  the  Bank  of 
Japan's Nagoya Branch. 
 At  the  Monetary  Policy  Meeting  (MPM)  held  last  week,  the  Bank  updated  its  projections 
for  Japan's  economic  activity  and  prices  through  fiscal  2021.  In  particular,  it  examined 
economic and price developments while paying closer attention to the fact that slowdowns 
in  overseas  economies  have  continued  and  their  downside  risks  seem  to  be  increasing. 
Today, while outlining this examination, I would like to explain the Bank's view on Japan's 
economic activity and prices as well as its thinking behind the  recent conduct of monetary 
policy. 
 I. Economic Developments 
Let  me  start  by  talking  about  economic  developments.  At  the  MPM  held  last  week,  the 
Bank  assessed  that  Japan's  economy  was  likely  to  continue  on  an  expanding  trend 
throughout the projection period -- that is, through fiscal 2021. There has been no change to 
this overall assessment. While the recovery in external demand is expected  to slow due to 
the delay in the timing of a pick-up in overseas economies, domestic demand is likely to be 
firm as the impact of the delay is expected to be limited. I will elaborate on this mechanism 
in what follows. 
 First, I would like to explain developments in overseas economies (Chart 1). Since the turn 
of this year, the diffusion indexes (DIs) for business sentiment of manufacturing firms on a 
global  basis  have  remained  below  50,  which  is  the  borderline  between  improvement  and 
deterioration  of  business  conditions  perceived  by  firms.  The  U.S.-China  trade  friction  has 
exerted a negative impact on the global trade activity as there had been incremental rises in 
additional  tariffs  until  a  partial  agreement  was  reached  in  mid-October.  In  addition, 
slowdowns  have  continued  to  be  observed  in  emerging  economies,  partly  because  it  has 
been  taking  time  for  the  effects  of  China's  economic  policy  to  materialize.  Against  the 
background of these developments, a pick-up in overseas economies has been delayed and 
 1 
its timing is expected to lag behind by about half a year compared to the previous projection. 
The World Economic Outlook (WEO) released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 
which  has  been  revised  somewhat  downward  from  the July  projections,  presents  a  similar 
view. 
 However,  the  Bank's  projection  for  overseas  economies  does  not  assume  further 
deceleration. The IMF also maintains the outlook that the global economy will accelerate its 
growth pace next year. The reason is as follows. Since the turn of this year, monetary easing 
has been pursued by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB), in addition 
to central banks in many emerging economies. While the household and nonmanufacturing 
sectors  have  been  steady  thus  far  despite  the  weak  manufacturing  sector,  accommodative 
financial  conditions  are  expected  to  support  domestic  demand  in  these  economies.  In 
addition,  there  has  been  gradual  progress  in  adjustments  in  IT-related  goods,  which  had 
been one of the factors behind the weakness in the global manufacturing sector (Chart 2). 
The  world  semiconductor  shipments  had  continued  to  register  negative  growth  on  a 
quarterly  basis,  but  have  been  flat  recently.  Thus,  downward  pressure  stemming  from 
adjustments  in  IT-related  goods  is  expected  to  diminish.  Under  these  circumstances, 
overseas  economies  are  expected  to  raise  their  growth  rates  and  grow  moderately  on  the 
whole.  However,  this  outlook  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  trade  friction  will  not 
intensify  further.  As  I  will  explain  later,  there  is  no  change  in  the  situation  that  downside 
risks concerning overseas economies warrant vigilance. 
 Although the timing of a pick-up in overseas economies has been delayed, the Bank expects 
that  Japan's  economy  will  not  decelerate  substantially,  as  I  mentioned  earlier.  This  is 
because,  while  external  demand  is  expected  to  decrease,  reflecting  developments  in 
overseas  economies,  domestic  demand  is  likely  to  remain  firm.  Japan's  economy  has 
experienced  many  business  cycle  episodes  where  the  initial  drivers  were  fluctuations  in 
external  demand.  However,  in  the  current  phase,  weakness  in  external  demand  has  not 
affected domestic demand, at least thus far, mainly due to steady business fixed investment. 
In addition, the Bank had paid careful attention to the impact of the consumption tax hike in 
October  based  on  past  experience,  and  this  has  remained  small  compared  to  that  of  the 
previous tax hike in 2014 as far as available data suggest. In the next part of my speech, I 
 2 
will elaborate on developments in economic activity in Japan in terms of external demand 
and domestic demand. 
 First,  external  demand  has  continued  to  show  some  weakness,  mainly  in  capital  goods,  as 
signs of a further deceleration in business fixed investment have been observed, such as in 
China  (Chart  3).  Business  sentiment  in  the  manufacturing  sector in  the  September  Tankan 
(Short-Term  Economic  Survey  of  Enterprises  in  Japan)  has  become  clearly  cautious, 
reflecting weakness in external demand and related production. As for the outlook, external 
demand is likely to continue to show some weakness for the time being due to the delay in 
the timing of a pick-up in overseas economies. 
 On the other hand, domestic demand has remained firm. In the September Tankan, business 
sentiment  of  the  nonmanufacturing  sector  has  maintained  a  relatively  high  level.  Among 
components  of  domestic  demand,  business  fixed  investment  has  continued  on  an  uptrend 
(Chart 4). Business fixed investment plans in the September Tankan were steady, exceeding 
the average of past September surveys. Specifically, while machinery investment has been 
somewhat weak in the manufacturing sector due to the effects of the slowdown in overseas 
economies, it has remained steady in the nonmanufacturing sector. In the nonmanufacturing 
sector, not only machinery investment but also software investment has seen an acceleration 
in  its  growth  pace,  reflecting  strong  demand  for  saving  labor  and  improving  efficiency. 
Research and development (R&D) investment has maintained its pace of increase in a wide 
range  of  industries,  including  those  related  to  exports.  Construction  investment  also  has 
continued  on  an  uptrend,  mainly  on  the  back  of  urban  development  projects  and  the 
construction of logistics facilities accompanying the spread of e-commerce. With regard to 
the  outlook,  business  fixed  investment  is  projected  to  see  a  temporary  deceleration  in  its 
pace of increase, mainly in the manufacturing sector, reflecting the effects of the slowdown 
in overseas economies. However, amid accommodative financial conditions, it is expected 
to continue increasing moderately thereafter, mainly for investments that are relatively less 
susceptible  to  the  effects  of  changes  in  overseas  demand,  such  as  investment  for  urban 
development  projects,  labor-saving  investment,  and  R&D  investment  for  growth  areas. 
Such steady business fixed investment seems to be attributable to changes in firms' behavior, 
which has become positive in terms of taking future business opportunities and addressing 
 3 
long-term  challenges  because  the  moderate  expanding  trend  in  Japan's  economy  has 
continued for a few years and a sustained decline in prices is no longer observed. 
 Private consumption has increased moderately (Chart 5). The impact of the consumption tax 
hike is likely to be smaller than that of the previous tax hike in 2014, mainly because the net 
burden  on  households  is  small  and  various  measures  to  smooth  out  demand  have  been 
implemented.  The  moderate  increase  in  private  consumption  is  mainly  attributable  to  the 
improvement  in  the  employment  and  income  situation  (Chart  6).  Labor  market  conditions 
have been tight, in a situation where the active job openings-to-applicants ratio has stayed at 
a level that exceeds the peak marked during the bubble period and the unemployment rate 
has  declined  to  the  range  of  2.0-2.5  percent.  Employee  income  has  continued  to  increase. 
Regarding  the  outlook,  with  the  employment  and  income  situation  continuing  to  improve, 
private consumption is expected to follow a moderate increasing trend, although it is likely 
to be pushed down temporarily due  to the effects of the tax hike. Meanwhile, government 
spending  is  likely  to  underpin  economic  activity  going  forward,  mainly  on  the  back  of  an 
increase 
in  disaster-related  restoration  and  reconstruction,  Olympic  Games-related 
expenditure, and public investment associated with national resilience. 
 Thus,  Japan's  economy  is  likely  to  continue  on  an  expanding  trend  throughout  the 
projection period -- that is, through fiscal 2021 -- as the impact of the slowdown in overseas 
economies on domestic demand is expected to be limited, although the economy is likely to 
continue to be affected by the slowdown for the time being (Chart 7). In the latest Outlook 
for  Economic  Activity  and  Prices  (Outlook  Report),  the  medians  of  the  forecasts  for  the 
growth rate are 0.6 percent for fiscal 2019, 0.7 percent for fiscal 2020, and 1.0 percent for 
fiscal 2021. 
 So  far,  I  have  talked  about  the  outlook  for  economic  activity.  There  is  no  change  in  the 
situation  that  downside  risks  are  significant,  mainly  regarding  developments  in  overseas 
economies. As for the U.S.-China trade friction, although the partial agreement reached last 
month  can  be  viewed  as  a  positive  move,  future  developments  remain  uncertain.  With 
regard to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU), a situation where the 
United Kingdom leaves the EU without a deal at end-October was avoided, but there remain 
 4 
uncertainties given that the general election is scheduled to take place in December. There 
also  are  uncertainties  such  as  over  developments  in  emerging  economies  and  geopolitical 
risks.  Moreover,  attention  should  be  paid  to  the  fact  that  global  financial  markets  have 
become more  reactive  to these  risks.  If  such  downside  risks  materialize,  positive  behavior 
by firms could become cautious. Besides risks concerning overseas economies, the impact 
of  the  consumption  tax  hike  continues  to  warrant attention.  As  I  have  explained,  although 
the  degree  appears  to  be  small  for  now,  the  Bank  will  continue  to  conduct  a  careful 
examination of the impact, including that on consumer sentiment. 
 II. Price Developments 
Let  me  move  on  to  price  developments.  At  the  September  MPM,  the  Bank  judged  that  it 
was becoming necessary to pay closer attention to the possibility that the momentum toward 
achieving  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent  would  be  lost,  given  that  slowdowns  in 
overseas economies had continued to be observed and that their downside risks seemed to 
be  increasing.  Taking  this  situation  into  account,  it  examined  price  developments  and 
assessed the momentum toward achieving the price stability target at last week's MPM. In 
assessing  the  momentum,  the  Bank  considers  it  particularly  important  to  examine 
developments in (1) the output gap, which indicates the strength of economic activity, and 
(2) inflation expectations, which show people's perception of prices. 
 First,  I  would  like  to explain developments  in  the  output  gap  (Chart  8).  The output  gap  is 
expected  to  narrow  temporarily  within  positive  territory,  but  remain  at  around  the  current 
level on average. In other words, aggregate demand is likely to continue exceeding average 
supply capacity. As I explained earlier, Japan's economy is expected to grow temporarily at 
a  somewhat  slower  pace  than  its  potential,  reflecting  the  effects  of  the  slowdown  in 
overseas economies and the consumption tax hike, and the positive output gap is projected 
to  narrow.  However,  throughout  the  projection  period,  domestic  demand  is  likely  to 
continue on an uptrend as the impact of the slowdown in overseas economies is expected to 
remain  limited.  In  addition,  since  overseas  economies  are  expected  to  pick  up  eventually, 
Japan's  economy  is  likely  to  maintain  an  expanding  trend.  Under  these  circumstances,  the 
output gap is expected to remain at around the current positive level on average. 
  5 
Next,  let  me  talk  about  developments  in  inflation  expectations  (Chart  9).  Measures  of 
inflation expectations based on surveys, for example, have shown somewhat mixed signals, 
in  that  some  have  indicated  relatively  weak  developments  while  others  have  shown  an 
increase; on the whole, however, inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged. 
In  order  to  grasp  developments  in  people's  inflation  expectations,  it  also  is  important  to 
monitor  changes  in  households'  perception  of  prices  as  well  as  firms'  price-setting  stance. 
When  "comments  on  the  rise  in  prices"  from  the  Opinion  Survey  on  the  General  Public's 
Views  and  Behavior  are  regarded  as  a  measure  for  households'  tolerance  of  price  rises, 
households' tolerance since 2017 has remained at a level that exceeds the  past average. As 
for the price-setting stance of firms that are closely related to consumption, the output prices 
DI  for  consumption-related  industries  shows  that  the  proportion  of  enterprises  answering 
that output prices have risen has continued to exceed the proportion of those answering that 
such  prices  have  fallen,  and  the  gap  has  been  expanding,  albeit  at  a  moderate  pace. 
Regarding the outlook, it is expected that households' tolerance of price rises will increase 
steadily  and  firms'  stance  gradually  will  shift  toward  further  raising  prices  as  the 
employment  and  income  situation  is  likely  to  continue  improving  with  the  output  gap 
remaining positive. Accordingly, households' and firms' inflation expectations are likely to 
increase gradually. 
 Moreover,  developments  in  crude  oil  prices  and  global  financial  markets  affect  prices. 
Crude oil prices have been more or less flat -- albeit with fluctuations -- since around this 
summer, although they have been lower compared to the level seen around spring. In global 
financial  markets,  investors'  risk  aversion  had  continued  to  be  observed,  but  the  markets 
recently have been calm compared to a while ago. 
 Given  these  observations,  the  Bank  judged  at  last  week's  MPM  that  there  had  been  no 
further  increase  in  the  possibility  that  the  momentum  toward  achieving  the  price  stability 
target  would  be  lost.  On  this  basis,  it  expects  that  the  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the 
consumer price index (CPI) is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, mainly on the 
back of the output gap remaining positive and inflation expectations rising, despite the CPI 
inflation  rate  being  affected  by  such  factors  as  the  decline  in crude  oil  prices  for  the  time 
being (Chart 10). In the latest Outlook Report, it is projected that the year-on-year rates of 
 6 
change in the CPI excluding fresh food will be 0.7 percent for fiscal 2019, 1.1 percent for 
fiscal 2020, and 1.5 percent for fiscal 2021. 
 That  said,  risks  to  the  outlook  for  prices  are  skewed  to  the  downside,  and  thus  close 
attention should continue to be paid to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving 
the  price  stability  target  will  be  lost.  In  particular,  it  is  necessary  to  take  into  account  the 
possibility  that,  if  downside  risks  to  economic  activity  materialize,  they  will  affect  prices, 
mainly through downward pressure on the output gap. Therefore, the Bank will continue to 
carefully examine economic and price developments and closely monitor whether there will 
be  no  increase  in  the  possibility  that  the  momentum  toward  achieving  the  price  stability 
target will be lost. 
 III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy 
Now, I would like to talk about the Bank's conduct of monetary policy. 
 The  Bank  has  been  conducting  monetary  policy  while  examining  economic  and  price 
developments from two perspectives: the baseline scenario for the outlook and risk analysis. 
In the current situation where downside risks to economic activity and prices are significant, 
the  examination  of  risks  is  becoming  increasingly  important  (Chart  11).  In  order  to  make 
this  thinking  clearer,  the  Bank  clarified  in  the  July  policy  statement  that  it  would  not 
hesitate  to  take  additional  easing  measures  if  there  was  a  greater  possibility  that  the 
momentum toward achieving the price stability target would be lost, and emphasized in the 
September  statement  that  it  would  reexamine  economic  and  price  developments  at  the 
October MPM, when it releases the Outlook Report. At the same time, in a situation where 
downside  risks  to  economic  activity  and  prices  have  become  significant,  the  aim  of  these 
descriptions in the statements was to indicate that the Bank's basic policy stance is further 
tilted toward monetary accommodation. 
 At last week's MPM, based on our examination results, the Bank judged that there had been 
no further increase in the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability 
target  would  be  lost,  but  that  it  was  necessary  to  continue  paying  close  attention  to  the 
possibility,  given  that  downside  risks  concerning  overseas  economies  seemed  to  be 
 7 
increasing. With a view to clarifying the assessment of economic and price developments as 
well as the Bank's policy stance of being further tilted toward monetary accommodation, the 
Bank  decided  on  a  new  forward  guidance  for  the  policy  rates  at  that  meeting  (Chart  12). 
Specifically,  the  Bank  expects  short-  and  long-term  policy  interest  rates  to remain  at  their 
present or lower levels as long as it is necessary to pay close attention to the possibility that 
the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost. There are two points 
here.  First,  the  Bank  clearly  related  the  forward  guidance  to  the  momentum  toward 
achieving  the  price  stability  target.  Second,  the  Bank  reflected  its  policy  stance  of  being 
tilted toward monetary accommodation in the forward guidance for the policy rates as well. 
On this basis, it clarified that there would be a downward bias in the policy rates. However, 
I would like to add that this does not limit additional easing measures to lowering the policy 
rates. There is no change in our understanding that, besides lowering the policy rates, there 
are various possible measures for additional easing -- such as expanding asset purchases and 
accelerating the expansion of the monetary base -- depending on developments in economic 
activity and prices as well as financial conditions, and that combinations or applications of 
these various measures also would be an option. 
 The  Bank  will  continue  to  conduct  appropriate  monetary  policy  without  preconception, 
taking  account  of  developments  in  economic  activity  and  prices  as  well  as  financial 
conditions, while carefully examining various risks. 
 Conclusion 
Before concluding my speech, I would like to touch on developments in the economy of the 
Tokai region. Since the turn of the year, the regional economy has remained steady despite 
the slowdown in overseas economies affecting exports and production across Japan. Labor 
market  conditions  in  the  region  have  remained  tight;  for  more  than  a  year,  the  active  job 
openings-to-applicants ratio has been around 2 times and the unemployment rate has been 2 
percent  or  below.  In  addition,  growth  in  scheduled  cash  earnings  has  exceeded  that  for 
Japan  as  a  whole.  As  for  the  corporate  sector,  business  fixed  investment  has  continued  to 
increase  on  the  back  of  high  levels  of  corporate  profits.  With  the  slowdown  in  overseas 
economies continuing, there have been some postponements in nonessential and nonurgent 
investment  intended  for  capacity  expansion,  but  forward-looking  investments  --  that  is, 
 8 
R&D  investment  as  well  as  labor-saving  and  efficiency-improving  investment  --  have 
increased. Such forward-looking investments that are relatively less susceptible to changes 
in  overseas  demand  are  underpinning  the  expanding  trend  in  the  economic  activity  across 
the country, and this tendency is notable particularly in this region. 
 The  steady  regional  economy  seems  to  be  attributable  not  only  to  the  high  quality  of 
manufacturing but also the high ability to analyze and grasp consumers' needs in detail. For 
example,  in  the  automobile  industry,  a  framework  has  been  established  in  which  firms 
monitor  developments  in  demand  worldwide  through  detailed  analysis  and  provide 
instantaneous  feedback  on  the  outcome  to  their  production  process.  Through  such 
framework, they can completely manage the process in an integrated manner, starting from 
market analysis through the distribution of products to their customers, which enables them 
to run their business flexibly amid high uncertainties. 
 I  would  like  to  close  my  speech  today  by  making  a  commitment  that  the  Bank  will 
persistently pursue powerful monetary easing, thereby providing its utmost support for your 
corporate activities. 
 Thank you very much for your attention.

III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy
Chart 11
BOJ's Conduct of Monetary Policy
Assessment of Economic Activity and 
Prices from Two Perspectives 
Excerpt from September 2019 
Statement on Monetary Policy
The first perspective
Examining the outlook for economic activity 
and prices deemed most likely by the Bank 
of Japan
The second perspective
Examining, in a longer term, various risks that 
are most relevant to the conduct of monetary 
policy
The Bank will continue with "Quantitative and Qualitative 
Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control," aiming to 
achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is 
necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. . . . In 
particular, in a situation where downside risks to economic 
activity and prices, mainly regarding developments in overseas 
economies, are significant, the Bank will not hesitate to take 
additional easing measures if there is a greater possibility that the 
momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost.
Given that, recently, slowdowns in overseas economies have 
continued to be observed and their downside risks seem to be 
increasing, the Bank judges that it is becoming necessary to pay 
closer attention to the possibility that the momentum toward 
achieving the price stability target will be lost. Taking this 
situation into account, the Bank will reexamine economic and 
price developments at the next MPM, when it updates the 
outlook for economic activity and prices.
III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy
BOJ's Forward Guidance
11
Chart 12
BOJ decided on a new forward guidance for the policy rates (Oct. 2019)
As for the policy rates, the Bank expects short- and long-term interest rates to  
remain at their present or lower levels as long as it is necessary to pay close 
attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability 
target will be lost.
First point: Clearly related to the momentum toward achieving the price stability target.
Second point: Clarified that there was "a downward bias" in the policy rates.
