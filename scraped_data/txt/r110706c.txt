Karolina Ekholm: Do global imbalances pose a risk to the Swedish 
economy? 
Speech  by  Ms  Karolina  Ekholm,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  the 
Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Stockholm, 13 June 2011. 
 The views expressed in this  speech are  my own and are  not necessarily shared  by the other  members of the 
Riksbank’s Executive Board or the staff of the Riksbank. I would like to thank Hanna Armelius for all her help in 
writing this speech. 
Financial  crises  often  come  as  a  surprise.  After  the  event,  however,  it  may  be  a  simple 
matter  to  look  back  and  see  all  the  flashing  warning  lights  that  should  have  signalled  that 
things were about to go seriously wrong. I do not think many people realised how vulnerable 
the  global  financial  system  really  was  before  the  latest  crisis,  and  consequently  this  crisis 
came as a surprise too. However, there were people who did see warning lights flashing. The 
problem was that they appeared to be flashing for a different type of crisis than the one that 
eventually arrived. 
What  we  expected  to  arrive  was  an  international  crisis  triggered  by  a  collapse  in  the  real 
value of the dollar.1 The warning lights began flashing due to the major global imbalances 
arising from the fact that that some countries, above all the United States, had substantial 
and persistent current account deficits while others, for example China, had substantial and 
persistent current account surpluses. It appeared probable that the dollar would depreciate 
as  it  was  difficult  to  believe  that  the  United  States  would  be  able  to  maintain  its  deficit 
indefinitely,2  and  the  real  exchange  rate  normally  weakens  when  a  current  account  deficit 
needs  to be  corrected. And  the  dollar’s  status as  a  reserve  currency  throughout  the  world 
made the entire global economy sensitive to rapid changes in the dollar rate. 
Although  a  dollar  crisis  did  not  occur,  the  analysis  was  reasonable.  Substantial  and 
persistent current account surpluses or deficits may be a sign of an underlying weakness or 
imbalance in the economy. Even though global imbalances have subsequently declined, this 
is  due  more  to  cyclical  factors  than  to  structural  factors.  They  have  also  increased  again 
recently in pace with the recovery of the global economy. The International Monetary Fund 
(IMF)  continues  to  monitor  the  development  of  global  imbalances  and  says  that  an 
adjustment of these imbalances is necessary if the recovery is to rest on stable foundations.3 
The association of developed countries and emerging economies that goes under the name 
G20 has therefore decided to perform thorough analyses when surpluses or deficits become 
substantial, in order to determine whether the country concerned should take measures. In 
the  risk  survey  conducted  by  the  Riksbank  in  May  this  year,  in  which  participants  on  the 
Swedish fixed-income and foreign-exchange markets were asked to assess the risks to the 
Swedish financial system, global imbalances were seen as the greatest risk.

and Rogoff also warned about a substantial depreciation of the dollar as a result of global imbalances as early 
as 2005. 
2  Some observers claimed, however, that the deficit could be sustainable as to a certain extent it could consist 
of “dark matter” in the form of the value of the knowledge transferred from direct US investments abroad and 
the implicit insurance services provided to the rest of the world by US financial institutions, see Hausmann and 
Sturzenegger, 2005.

Today  I  intend  to  present  my  view  of  the  global  imbalances  and  their  significance  to  the 
Swedish  economy.4  There  is  currently  a  widely-held  view  that  the  large  current  account 
surpluses and deficits make the global economy vulnerable, and that they should therefore 
be  reduced.  A  move  towards  reduced  surpluses  and  deficits  could  affect  the  Swedish 
economy in a way that has significance for monetary policy. Although it may be underlying 
imbalances that give rise to deficits and surpluses, we should not, in my view, set targets for 
how  large  these  deficits  and  surpluses  should  be.  Surpluses  and  deficits  are  to  a  certain 
extent  a  natural  result  of  the  different  conditions  in  different  countries  and  important 
mechanisms for redistributing capital in a way that makes the global economy more effective. 
Sweden, for example, has had a relatively large current account surplus for 15 years. It is 
currently larger than China’s, calculated as a percentage of GDP. However, there is nothing 
to suggest that this surplus is the result of underlying imbalances in the Swedish economy. In 
the  first  instance,  it  is  rather  the  consequence  of  a  relatively  high,  but  justified,  level  of 
saving. There are therefore, in my view, no strong reasons to expect this surplus to become 
a  deficit  within  the  near  future  –  something  which  would  typically  happen  through  a 
strengthening of the real exchange rate. In my opinion, the current account surplus is thus 
not in itself an indication of a stronger krona. 
What are the global imbalances and why have they arisen? 
When we speak about global imbalances we usually mean a situation in which deficits and 
surpluses  in  the  current  accounts  of  different  countries  appear  to  be  unsustainable  in  the 
long term.5 A surplus means that the value of a country’s total output exceeds the value of 
the country’s total consumption. In the same way as a household whose income exceeds its 
expenditure will save the difference, a current account surplus constitutes a form of saving 
for a country. In effect, the current account reflects the difference between total saving in the 
country  and  domestic  investment.  A  countries  income,  which  consists  of  the  value  of  the 
goods and services produced there, can be used for consumption or for saving. Saving can 
in turn be used for domestic investment and for investment abroad. If total saving is higher 
than domestic investment, some of the saving must be invested in foreign assets and thus 
used  for  investment  abroad.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  total  saving  is  not  sufficient  to  cover 
domestic  investment,  the  county  will  have  to  borrow  from  other  countries  (from  private  or 
public  sources).  This  means  that  countries  with  a  current  account  surplus  can  invest  in  or 
lend to others, while countries with a deficit borrow from abroad.  
In theory, capital should flow from more developed countries to emerging economies, as the 
return on capital should be higher there. This is also largely what we saw in Europe before 
the  crisis  –  countries  in  southern  and  eastern  Europe  had  current  account  deficits,  while 
countries like Germany and Sweden had surpluses. Figure 1 shows current accounts, private 
net capital and GDP growth for eastern and central Europe. Many of these relatively rapidly-
growing countries experienced a rapid expansion of credit, which contributed to the build-up 
of substantial current account deficits in the years before the crisis.6 These countries then 
experienced steep falls in GDP during the crisis, which raises some doubts about whether 
the capital flows were really motivated by high returns. At the global level, however, there are 
many  cases  where  less-developed  countries,  such  as  China,  are  lending  to  developed 
countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom.  
                                                 
4  This  speech  is  largely  based  on  a  paper  I  have  written  together  with  Henrik  Braconier,  see  Braconier  and 
Ekholm, 2011. 
5  The current account mainly consists of the difference between exports and imports of goods and services. Net 
capital  income  and  various  charges  paid  to  and  received  from  abroad  are  also  included,  but  these 
components usually account for a much smaller part of the total than net exports.

Global imbalances have increased since the deregulation of the capital markets at the end of 
the 1980s. One of the reasons for this is that countries with surpluses, such as China, have 
grown  more  rapidly  than  other  countries.  The  higher  rate  of  growth  means  that  China’s 
savings  surplus  (the  difference  between  saving  and  investment)  has  increased  as  a 
percentage of global GDP. As the current accounts in the world must in theory total zero, this 
means that other countries must have increasing deficits to a corresponding degree.7 On the 
deficit side, the Unites States stands out in that it alone has accounted for three-quarters of 
the world’s total current account deficit. The United States has also been in deficit for a very 
long time, as much as 20 years. The countries that have a surplus, and that in practice thus 
lend  money  to  the  United  States  and  other  countries  with  deficits,  have  primarily  been  a 
number  of  oil-producing  countries  and  China,  but  also  include  Japan,  Germany  and  some 
other Asian countries (see Figure 2).

Current account surpluses or deficits are not bad in themselves and do not necessarily entail 
an  unsustainable  imbalance  in  the  long  term.  In  a  globalised  world  they  are  a  natural 
consequence  of  the  different  conditions  in  different  countries  in  terms  of  factors  such  as 
demography, the degree of development and natural assets. A surplus may be justified by a 
country’s  need  to  have  a  high  level  of  domestic  saving  –  for  example  due  to  an  ageing 
population – but also means that consumption will be held back, thus reducing the demand 
for other countries’ exports. However, some underlying problems, such as a too low level of 
saving linked to a too optimistic view of the future, may be reflected in a weakening of the 
current account. This can also contribute to generally low interest rates which, in combination 
with other factors such as shortcomings in the supervision of the financial sector, generate 
the potential for a financial crisis of the type we have just experienced. 
The  factors  that  above  all  led  the  imbalances  to  grow  in  the  years  before  the  crisis  were 
above all increased saving in the public sector and the corporate sector in China, together 
with increased saving in the oil-producing countries. Investment, on the other hand, remained 
at approximately the same level as previously.8 It appears that the increase in saving exerted 
a worldwide downward pressure on long-term interest rates, which may have led investors to 
turn to higher-risk assets in the hunt for higher yields. In the United States, however, saving 
was low and investment was high partly because of the low interest rates. The low interest 
rates  also  stimulated  the  housing  market  which,  in  combination  with  decades  of  an 
                                                 
8  China has had a very high investment ratio, but aggregate saving is even higher.

expansionary  housing  policy,  led  to  the  build-up  of  a  bubble  that  eventually  burst.  Many 
observers  therefore  believe  that  the  global  imbalances  were  one  of  the  causes  of  the 
financial crisis.9 
There are better and worse reasons for current account surpluses and deficits 
In the 1970s and 1980s, large current account surpluses or deficits were generally regarded 
as  something  negative.  This  period  was  marked  by  fixed  exchange  rates  and  by  the 
regulation of capital flows across national borders. A deficit was often seen as a sign of an 
approaching  devaluation.  However,  after  the  capital  markets  were  deregulated  and  the 
exchange  rates  began  to  float  to  a  greater  extent,  the  view  became  more  positive.  It  was 
assumed  that  changes  in  the  current  accounts  reflected  an  optimal  redistribution  of  the 
freely-moving capital. In the 2000s, however, we began to hear warnings that, above all, a 
rapid  correction  of  the  imbalances  could  have  serious  consequences  for  the  value  of  the 
dollar, resulting in rising long-term interest rates, recession and a possible financial crisis.10 
The  fact  that  capital  flowed  from  emerging  economies  with  great  growth  potential  to  the 
United  States  –  where  it  was  apparently  used  to  a  large  extent  to  finance  investment  in 
housing – indicated that this was not a case of capital seeking a higher marginal return but 
rather of an excessive provision of credit.  
At  the  same  time  as  the  US  households  became  increasingly  indebted,  major  currency 
reserves were built in, for example, China. It was at this time that Ben Bernanke spoke about 
a ”global saving glut”.11 There were, however, good reasons why the level of saving was high 
in many Asian countries. Following the crisis in Asia in the early 1990s, the countries wanted 
to build up currency reserves to protect themselves against future stoppages in capital flows. 
Research indicates that countries that had reduced their vulnerability in this way were also hit 
less  hard  by  the  latest  crisis.12  Furthermore,  there  were,  and  still  are,  weaknesses  in  the 
social safety nets of several of these countries which mean that households have to save in 
order, for example, to be able to afford medical costs in the future. China also has an ageing 
population as a result of the one-child policy, which may also justify a high level of saving.  
There  have  been  claims  from  the  United  States,  however,  that  the  substantial  current 
account  surplus  is  largely  due  to  the  fact  that  China's  currency  is  undervalued  and  thus 
indirectly favours Chinese exports and production that competes with imports. Other factors 
that may have contributed to the surplus is that the financial market in the United States is 
more  highly  developed  than  in  many  Asian  countries,  which  has  made  it  advantageous  to 
invest savings there rather than in the domestic economy, and that companies in China pay 
out a relatively small part of the profits in dividends, which probably helps to boost saving but 
restrict consumption.13 
Global imbalances and capital flows after the crisis 
The  crisis  that  actually  arrived  took  an  entirely  different  course  than  many  expected. 
Although  the  United  States  was  hit  hard,  the  dollar  was  actually  strengthened  initially 
because investors fled from risk and US government securities were seen as a safe asset. 
The countries that had large current account deficits were, however, hit to a greater extent

than  countries  with  surpluses  by  major  falls  in  housing  prices.14  This  shows  that  current 
account  deficits  were  often  a  reflection  of  underlying  weaknesses,  for  example  unsound 
lending practices and the build-up of debt.  
However,  the  crisis  itself  and  the  subsequent  recession  reduced  the  imbalances,  at  least 
temporarily. The savings ratio increased in the United States at the same time as domestic 
demand increased more rapidly in China as a result of a fiscal policy stimulation package. 
The  substantial  fall in oil  prices  also  played  a  role.  The  question  is, however,  whether  the 
underlying  causes  of  the  imbalances  have  been  corrected.  The  IMF  believes  that  the 
imbalances will remain in place in the period ahead (see Figure 2). The oil price has also 
increased considerably during the last six months, which also indicates that the imbalances 
will remain. This is because this boosts net exports in oil-exporting countries, which tend to 
have  current  account  surpluses,  but  increases  costs  for  oil  importers,  who  tend  to  have 
current account deficits.  
The G20 has pointed to the global imbalances as being an important factor for development 
in the global economy. One aspect that has been discussed is whether to adjust the nominal 
exchange rates in order to reduce the imbalances. If China, for example, maintains a fixed 
exchange rate against the dollar, this will make it possible to adjust the real exchange rate if 
China has a higher rate of inflation than the United States. However, this entails either a high 
rate of inflation in China, which the Chinese authorities are not likely to want, or to deflation in 
the  United  States,  which  the  US  authorities  definitely  do  not  want.  In  connection  with  the 
outbreak of the crisis, China stopped the appreciation of the renminbi that had been going on 
for  several  years  and  instead  pegged  the  renminbi  to  the  dollar  until  June  last  year.  This 
meant that China’s currency followed the depreciation of the dollar that came when the worst 
of  the  crisis  was  over  and  investors  once  again  began  to  turn  to  higher-risk  assets,  for 
example by investing in assets in the emerging economies (Figure 3). 
                                                 
14  My own calculations in accordance with the method used by the IMF to identify major falls in house prices in 
WEO  in  October  2009  (a  fall  in  house  prices  is  defined  as  major  if  a  four-quarterly  moving  average  of  the 
annual growth in real house prices falls below –5 per cent) shows that 2/3 of the countries that experienced 
falls in house prices had large current account deficits while only ¼ those that did not experience price falls 
had deficits.

This put some emerging economies with a floating exchange rate in an awkward position as 
they did not want to lose too much competitiveness in relation to China while at the same 
time  large  capital  inflows  tended  to  strengthen  their  exchange  rates.  The  G20  has  now 
agreed that in certain situations it may be justified to introduce temporary capital regulations 
to protect against volatile capital flows. The view is that in normal cases a country should use 
monetary  or  fiscal  policy,  or  tools  for  macro  prudential  supervision,  but  that  in  exceptional 
cases it may be appropriate to introduce measures to control capital. Work is underway to 
set up common guidelines.15  
Why does Sweden have such a large current account surplus? 
Prior to the crisis of the 1990s, it was usual for Sweden to have current account deficits for 
long periods of time (see Figure 4). After the crisis the krona weakened substantially at the 
same time as the deficit became a surplus. Since then, Sweden has not only had a surplus, it 
has had a very substantial and, to a certain extent, a growing surplus.

There are many possible explanations for the large surpluses. As I have already mentioned, 
the current account surplus is due to the fact that domestic saving is higher than domestic 
investment. In Sweden, household saving increased following the economic crisis in the early 
1990s, which may partly be because the tax reforms implemented at that time made it much 
more  profitable  for  the  households  to  save.  The  fiscal  policy  framework  also  led  to  an 
increase  in  public  sector  net  lending.  The  pension  reform  of  1994  was  probably  another 
factor that contributed to the increase in household saving as future pension payments were 
linked  more  strongly  to  how  much  was  paid  into  the  system.  Sweden  also  has  an  ageing 
population  so  one  could  claim  that  saving  should  be  high  to  enable  us  to  cope  with 
increasing pension costs in the future.16 But this applies to most of our trading partners too. 
The age dependency ratio, that is the ratio between people of pensionable age and people of 
working  age,  is  expected  to  increase  in  Sweden  from  the  current  level  of  30 per  cent  to 
45 per cent by 2050. For Europe as a whole, however, the age dependency ratio is expected 
to  increase  from  25 per  cent  to  52 per  cent.  At  the  same  time,  of  all  the  countries  in  the 
OECD  only  Norway,  which  is  an  oil  exporter  and  Switzerland  have  larger  current  account 
surpluses as a percentage of GDP than Sweden.17  
The crisis of the 1990s perhaps meant that the Swedish public accepted the demand for a 
consolidation  of  public  finances  in  a  different  way  than  in  other  countries.  In  many  cases, 
these  countries  are  being  forced  to  conduct  similar  budget  consolidation  processes  now 
                                                 
16  This is a somewhat controversial claim, however, as future generations can be expected to have higher real 
incomes due to the growth of productivity in the economy.

instead. If so, this suggests that the differences in saving compared to other countries will 
decline  in  the  long  term,  and  thus  also  the  Swedish  current  account  surplus.  Another 
possible explanation for the high level of saving may be that the households underestimate 
how much is saved in the public pension system following the reform of the system.18 If this 
is the case, our level of saving could be unjustifiably high and could remain so for some time 
to come. Figure 5 shows saving in different sectors in Sweden.

It may also be the case that the explanation has more to do with investment. Sweden has 
had a lower investment ratio than both the OECD and the EU averages since the 1990s. The 
difference is almost entirely explained, however, by the fact that investment in housing has 
been lower in Sweden (Figure 6). This has partly been an adjustment following the very high 
level  of  investment  in  housing  in  the  1980s,  but  also  probably  relates  to  changes  in  the 
regulation in connection with the tax reform of 1991 and the fact that a new housing finance 
system was introduced in 1993.19 It is difficult to assess whether the level of investment in 
Sweden  can  be  regarded  as  having  being  unjustifiably  low  during  the  period  in  which  the 
current  account  surplus  has  grown.  Above  all  it  is  difficult  to  find  any  kind  of  reform  that 
would generally have been able to increase the return on Swedish investments in particular 
and thus have led to a higher investment ratio. 
                                                 
18  The National Institute of Economic Research (2011) puts this forward as a possible explanation of the high 
level of household saving in Sweden. 
19  The  so-called  Danell  system  implied  a  quick  winding  down  of  interest  subsidies  compared  to  the  previous 
rules.

After  the  fixed  exchange  rate  regime  was  abandoned  in  1992,  the  krona  depreciated  by 
almost 30 per cent in trade-weighted terms. The krona has in principle not recovered from 
this  weakening,  although  it  has  strengthened  significantly  recently.  According  to  various 
statistical methods, there has been no clear trend for the real exchange rate since the mid-
1990s (see Figure 7), which may indicate that the long-term value of the krona is close to the 
average during this period.20 The period with large current account surpluses can thus not be 
associated with any tendency towards a real strengthening of the krona.

In  this  context  it  is  worth  noting  that  Sweden,  despite  so  many  years  with  a  large  current 
account surplus, is estimated to have a negative net external position.21 In other words, the 
value of Swedish assets abroad is lower than  the total value of Swedish liabilities abroad. 
Last year, Swedish liabilities abroad were 2.5 times greater than GDP. The fact that stocks 
on  both  the  asset  and  liability  sides  are  large  means  that  variations  in  the  value  of  these 
stocks are important to the development of the external position. The current account on the 
other  hand,  which  constitutes  a  flow  that  adds  to  or  subtracts  from  these  stocks,  is  less 
important.22  Changes  in  the  valuation  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  are  affected  to  a  great 
extent by changes in the exchange rate.23 There are, however, considerable shortcomings in 
the statistics in this area. The values of some types of asset are definitely underestimated, as 
there is a lack of statistics on the Swedish households’ direct investments abroad. The net 
position  can  also  be  measured  in  different  ways  depending  on  whether  direct  investments 
are accounted at market value or at book or nominal value. However, both methods give a 
net position that is much lower than that given by the accumulated current account surplus 
(see Figure 8). 
                                                 
21  The  nominal  external  position  was  –22  per  cent  of  GDP  in  2010,  while  the  market-value  net  position  was 
+4 per cent of GDP according to statistics from Statistics Sweden. 
22  This is also found by Lane (2006) in an analysis of the Swedish exchange rate. 
23  For a more detailed analysis of the external position see Blomberg and Falk, 2006.

If it is the case that Sweden has no particularly large net claim internationally then this will 
have some significance for the prospects for the real exchange rate. In theory, countries with 
a  strong  external  position  should  in  the  long  term  experience  appreciating  real  exchange 
rates, and vice versa. There is also empirical support for the link between the net position 
and real exchange rates when studying different countries.24 With a net claim close to zero 
one would not necessarily expect any strengthening of the real exchange rate despite a large 
current account surplus. The fact that Sweden’s external position appears to be close to zero 
suggests  that  there  is  no  need  for  the  real  exchange  rate  for  the  krona  to  move  in  any 
particular  direction  for  this  reason.  Other  factors  also  affect  the  real  exchange  rate,  for 
example relative GDP growth, relative inflation and the terms of trade. In our latest forecasts, 
however, none of these factors has suggested that there will be any significant changes in 
the exchange rate for the krona in the period ahead.25 
The krona does not need to be strengthened, but Sweden is still affected by the global 
imbalances 
Despite  the  fact  that  Sweden  has  had  a  substantial  current  account  surplus  for  15  years 
there is nothing to suggest that this surplus must become a deficit within the near future to 
                                                 
24  See for example Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2002.

prevent Sweden from accumulating a large net claim in relation to the rest of the world. Nor 
is there anything to suggest that the Swedish krona should appreciate in real terms to enable 
a shift in the current account from a surplus to a deficit. As Sweden, as far as we can see, 
does not have any significant positive net external position, there is nothing to say that the 
real exchange rate needs to be strengthened for reasons relating to the net position.  
A  general  reduction  in  the  global  imbalances  could,  however,  have  consequences  for 
Sweden. Apart from the fact that this would reduce the risk of a new international crisis, it 
would  mean  that  a  larger  part  of  global  demand  would  come  from  those  countries  that 
currently have a surplus, for example China, and a smaller part from the United States. It is 
difficult to know, however, what impact this would have on the demand for Swedish export 
goods.  To  the  extent  that  Chinese  households  and  companies  demand  different  types  of 
goods than households and companies in the United States, this largely depends on whether 
Swedish  companies  are  flexible  enough  to  adapt  their  production  to  meet  changes  in  the 
pattern of demand. The Asian countries that have surpluses are a long way from  Sweden 
and  geo-graphical  distance  is  a  factor  that  has  a  clear  negative  link  to  the  propensity  of 
countries to trade with each other.26 However, there are countries with substantial surpluses 
that are close to Sweden, for example Germany. It is therefore not obvious what the overall 
impact  would  be  on  the  demand  for  Swedish  exports  if  there  was  a  general  reduction  in 
current  account  surpluses  and  deficits.  It  is  also  conceivable  that  the  United  States  would 
import more investment goods if its current account deficit decreased, as this would probably 
entail  an  expansion  of  the  export-oriented  industrial  sector  at  the  expense  of  the  more 
domestically-oriented service sector. This in turn would entail an increased demand for the 
type of industrial goods that Sweden exports quite a lot of. 
Reduced global imbalances could also entail rising long-term interest rates globally when the 
Asian countries with surpluses cut back their purchases of US government securities. This 
would probably also entail a weaker real exchange rate for the dollar. However, it is difficult 
to assess the consequences of this for the Swedish economy. 
There will always be current account surpluses and deficits as conditions differ from country 
to country. The fact that capital flows to rapidly-developing economies, where the return on 
capital is relatively high, also entails a redistribution of capital that makes the global economy 
more  effective.  Therefore,  in  my  view,  we  should  not  set  targets  for  the  size  of  current 
account surpluses or deficits. Sweden can be seen as an example of the fact that a large 
surplus is not necessarily an expression of an underlying imbalance in the economy.  
However, significant deviations in the current account may be a sign that something is not 
quite  right  in  the  economy.  They  can  also  interact  with  other  weaknesses,  for  example 
weaknesses in the financial system, as was the case before the financial crisis. It is therefore 
important  to  continue  monitoring  the  development  of  global  imbalances  and  to  understand 
what lies behind major deviations. Although considerable improvements in the regulation of 
the financial markets are underway, there is always a risk that new weakness will develop 
that we do not see until it is too late. Moreover, the fact that the crisis that arrived at the end 
of the 2000s was not the one that was expected does not mean that the expected crisis will 
not arrive at all. There is still a risk of a rapid correction of the global imbalances. This could 
lead  to  major  problems  for  the  global  economy,  which  has  hardly  recovered  yet  from  the 
crisis that we have just experienced.
