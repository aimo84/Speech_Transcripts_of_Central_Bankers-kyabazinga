José De Gregorio: Economic growth in Chile and copper 
Speech  by  Mr  José  De  Gregorio,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  at  the  CESCO 
conference “1984-2009, 25 Años de la Industria del Cobre y su impacto en Chile”, Santiago, 
1 September 2009. 
I thank Mariana García for her valuable contribution in preparing this work. 
 I want to begin by thanking you for inviting me to this Conference celebrating the copper and 
mining research center CESCO’s twenty-fifth birthday. It is an honor to have the opportunity 
to  speak  about  the  impact  of  the  mining  industry,  and  of  copper  especially,  on  Chile’s 
development,  given  its  importance  for  the  country  and  in  which  I  have  great  professional 
interest.  
Chile  is  abundant  in  natural  resources.  One  of  the  most  distinctive  characteristics  of  our 
economy is its large mining sector, particularly of copper, which places it as the world’s main 
copper producer. As a country we were blessed by nature with this enormous treasure. But 
as with every benefit, there can be related costs and risks that must be assessed. 
For  a  long  time,  natural  resources  have  been  part  of  the  discussion  about  economic 
development. Many years ago, natural resources were thought to be destined to a path of 
permanent price decline, which served as an argument to push forced industrialization. Such 
a vision proved to be based on wrong grounds. Nonetheless, development-related problems 
within the context of natural resource abundance have made their way back to the academic 
discussion in recent years. There are those who claim that natural resources are bad for a 
country’s  development.  They  find  that  the  abundance  of  natural  resources  has  been 
associated with a poor growth performance. This finding leads them to the conclusion – a 
wrong one in my view – that natural resources are hazardous to a country’s development.  
As  I  will  be  asserting  over  this  presentation,  natural  resources  are  a  blessing,  but  their 
abundance in a scenario of institutional and economic weakness may turn it into a curse. I 
will  also  comment  that,  in  the  case  of  Chile,  solid  bases  have  been  in  place  to  take 
advantage of the copper industry, very different from what occurred with nitrate in the early 
twentieth century. 
I  will  begin with  a  review  of  the international  evidence  on the  relationship  between  natural 
resources and growth, to then focus on Chile’s specific case and the relationship between 
abundance in our mining resources and our development. Then I will talk briefly about the 
current  economic  scenario  and  how  copper  price  fluctuations  are  no  longer  a  source  of 
instability, as used to be the case in the past or still is in some large commodity exporters. 
This is attributed to the significant advances we have made in our foreign exchange, fiscal, 
and  monetary  policies.  The  importance  of  this  cannot  be  overemphasized,  because  said

expansionary policies that should help Chile to overcome successfully the international crisis 
that hit the world at large in recent months. I will end with some final remarks. 
in  macroeconomic  policies  has  allowed  us 
to 
Economic growth and natural resources 
One paramount issue in our country’s development is its concentration of natural resources 
and, very specially, of copper ore. The world evidence shows that there are major differences 
in  growth  rates  among  natural  resource  abundant  economies.  One  example  is  Botswana, 
rich in diamonds, which early this decade could account for nearly 40% of GDP (Acemoglu et 
al., 2003). This country’s per capita GDP grew by an average 6.6% per year between 1960 
and 2007, which meant that in 2007, its per capital GDP was 19 times the one in 1970. An 
example to the contrary is the case of Nigeria, rich in oil, yet virtually stagnant. Its per capita

GDP  increased  by  an  average  1.2%  per  year  over  the  same  period,  which  meant  that  in 
2007 Nigeria had barely 1.5 times its per capita GDP of 1960.  
It has been found that, on average, countries rich in natural resources grow less than those 
that are not (figure 1). Based on this evidence, much research effort has been devoted to 
unraveling the link between economic growth and natural resource abundance, and that is 
what I intend to briefly cover now.  
International  evidence  and  discussions  on  the  relationship  between  natural  resources  and 
economic  development  are  varied.  Some  economists,  mainly  Sachs  and  Warner  (1995, 
1997, 2001), have argued that rather than a blessing, abundance of natural resources is a 
curse.  The  reasons  for  this  are  that  natural  resources  can  lead  to  rent-seeking  activities 
diverting scarce resources such as human and physical capital away from activities that favor 
growth.  At  the  same  time,  natural  resource  abundance  may  cause  a  persistent  real 
appreciation  that  may  weaken  the  rest  of  tradable  goods  sectors,  which  is  known  as  the 
Dutch  disease.  A  natural  conclusion  of  these  works  is  that  in  countries  that  prevent  rent-
seeking, with human capital abundance, access to credit and macroeconomic policies that 
promote  stability,  these  damaging  effects  can  be  avoided.  Subsequent  studies  have  been 
oriented in that direction.  
Several studies have explored new links between natural resources and growth, controlling 
for the strengths of each economy. For example, Arezki and van der Ploeg (2007) find that 
this  negative  relationship  between  natural  resource  abundance  and  growth  is  heavily 
affected by the country’s openness to international trade. They find that, the more open the 
economy,  the  less  likely  for  natural  resources  to  have  a  negative  contribution  to  growth. 
Therefore, trade openness can change the curse into a blessing. Meanwhile, Mehlum et al. 
(2006), using the same data as Sachs and Warner (1997), include an interaction between 
the  quality  of  institutions  and  natural  resource abundance to  examine  its  effect  on  growth. 
They  find  that  the  critical  element  behind  the  natural  resource  curse  is  bad  institutions.  In 
other  words,  if  the  country  has  good  institutions,  natural  resources  allow  them  to  grow 
faster.1
The interaction with the human capital endowment is also important. Bravo-Ortega and De 
Gregorio (2005) state that, whenever natural resources draw the scarce human capital away 
from growth favoring activities, the development of natural resources might reduce growth. 
Thus,  countries  with  high  endowment  of  human  capital  can  more  than  offset  the  negative 
effect of natural resource abundance on growth. Still, while growth can be slower, abundant 
natural  resources  do  result  in  higher  income,  which  is  what  ultimately  matters  from  the 
standpoint of the welfare of the population. 
Finally, it is worth to make the distinction between the abundance of and the dependence on 
natural  resources.  This  issue  has  been  analyzed  in  Cerný  and  Filer  (2006),  who  find  that 
natural resource dependent countries are the ones associated with low economic growth, not 
natural resource abundant ones.2
When studying the case of Chile, it can be argued that there is no evidence of the problems 
that  associate  natural  resource  abundance  with  bad  economic  performance.  On  the  one 
hand, we can observe that our country is more and more open to international trade (figure 
2). This integration not only brings benefits because of the traditional gains from trade based 
                                                 
1   Another  closely  related  work  is  Boschini  et  al.  (2003).  These  authors  claim  that  the  natural  resource  curse 
depends not  only on the  quality  of institutions but  also  on the characteristics of the resources. Specifically, 
whether it is easy to obtain large earnings in a short period of time from having control over the resource.

on comparative advantages, but it also induces better practices and technologies, as well as 
more competition in the markets, all factors that enhance economic growth.  
On the other hand, we know that Chile is rich in natural resources, especially mining ores, 
but our dependence on them is ever smaller. Actually, mining exports contribute every year a 
large  amount  of  resources  to  the  country,  but  their  share  of  total  exports  has  steadily 
declined over time, with the exception of the last few years due to the soaring price of copper 
(figure 3). 
Another  critical  element  mentioned  in  the  literature,  that  for  Chile  is  a  strong  one,  is  the 
quality  of  its  institutions.  Sound  institutions,  including  fiscal  discipline,  have  prevented  the 
“voracity” effects. A well educated labor force and full access to international capital markets 
have  kept  investments  in  other  activities  free  of  barriers,  and  the  real  exchange  rate, 
although  widely  fluctuating,  has  not  been  detrimental  to  the  development  of  the  exporting 
sector. 
By way of example, and to see the good position we are in now as compared with previous 
years, let us recall what happened with nitrate. As we all know, there was a “golden era” for 
nitrate between the years 1880 and 1930, where thanks to our resources and the external 
demand,  Chile  increased  strongly  its  international  trade,  obtained  large  amounts  of  fiscal 
resources and was able to take a leap forward. 
Our economy’s nitrate dependence is visible in the proportion of fiscal resources that came 
from this sector (figure 4). This is the typical case where high earnings coming from natural 
resources  create  incentives  to  reduce  the  other  taxes,  placing  the  economy  in  great  fiscal 
vulnerability, as it later occurred. Thus, when the golden era ended, the public external debt 
skyrocketed (from 28% of GDP in 1929 to 221% in 1932) and the economy suffered a severe 
contraction (figure 5), which was also fostered by the Great Depression. 
We  can  also  see  the  negative  effects  of  natural  resource  dependence  if  we  compare  the 
behaviors  of  nitrate,  copper,  and  output.  The  fluctuations  of  nitrate  output  value  had  an 
enormous  effect  on  GDP,  with  a  correlation  of  0.66  (figure  6).  This  is  quite  different 
nowadays, with a correlation between growth in copper output value and GDP of 0.05 (figure 
7). 
Summing  up,  the  review  of  the  international  evidence  allow  us  to  state  that  our  abundant 
copper has been a positive contribution to the Chilean economic growth and welfare, which 
is reinforced by institutional and economic strengths that prevent the distortions that natural 
resource abundance could have on the economy. Continuing on this subject, I will next talk 
about the way macroeconomic policies have helped in the context of the large swings of the 
price of copper.  
Macroeconomic policies and copper in the current scenario 
To  make  economies  less  vulnerable  to  commodity  price  fluctuations,  having  an  adequate 
macroeconomic policy framework is imperative. As will be argued in this section, this is the 
case in Chile today.3
It  is  common  knowledge  that  in  Latin  America,  cycles  have  historically  been  very 
pronounced. Global economic downturns have triggered strong adjustments in the countries 
in the region. This is largely due to the destabilizing effects of terms of trade fluctuations on 
public finances (Gavin and Perotti, 1997). Due to the importance of copper for fiscal income, 
a positive shock on its price should be expected to prompt destabilizing policies. This does 
not  occur,  however,  because  Chile’s  fiscal  policy  is  countercyclical,  and  is  based  on  a 
                                                 
3   This issue is also discussed in De Gregorio (2006).

structural  fiscal  balance  rule.  To  determine  the  structural  balance,  a  key  element  is  the 
estimated long-term copper price. This rule began being applied in 2001 with a target of 1% 
of GDP; last year it was brought down to 0.5% because of a large accumulation of resources 
in sovereign funds, and this year, to provide an extra fiscal impulse, it was reduced to 0% 
(figure 8). 
Although the structural balance policy was launched in this decade, fiscal efforts to smooth 
the copper price fluctuations began in the 1980s, with the copper stabilization fund. In fact, 
throughout most of the 1990s, the structural balance was near 1%. This countercyclical fiscal 
policy makes the effective fiscal balance highly correlated with the price of copper. Thus, our 
fiscal policy has been contributing for more than 20 years to stabilizing the Chilean economic 
cycle.  
As  a  result  of  the  application  of  the  rule,  a  large  amount  of  resources  has  been  saved  in 
sovereign funds when the price of copper has been high.4 In the period 2007-2008, 22 billion 
US dollars were placed in these funds, of which 20 billion – the equivalent to 12% of GDP – 
came  from  the  accumulation  of  new  funds,  and  the  difference  was  the  funds’  net  financial 
gain. This has had significant implications in the current economic scenario. 
Since  last  year,  particularly  as  from  September,  the  world  has  been  enduring  the  worst 
recession  in  the  last  60  years  and  our  country,  despite  being  in  an  excellent  position  to 
address these shocks, has not been spared its consequences. But today, our fiscal policy 
has been able to make an important reactivation effort, thanks to the prudence with which the 
years of high copper prices were managed. 
The  other  critical  elements  in  our  macroeconomic  policies  that  favor  stabilization  are 
monetary  and  foreign  exchange  policies.  Although  they  play  a  somewhat  more  subtle  role 
than fiscal policy, they are no less important. In the first place, a credible inflation-targeting 
regime ensures the proper reaction of monetary policy to significant deviations of output from 
its  full-employment  level.  In  particular,  negative  demand  shocks  that  may  come  from 
worsened external conditions should be accompanied by a reduction of the monetary policy 
rate  to  prevent  a  deanchoring  of  inflation  expectations  and  allow  the  economy  to  stabilize 
without suffering unsustainable, and costly to revert, contractions. This is especially visible 
today that the Central Bank board has reduced the monetary policy rate by 775 basis points, 
placing it at its minimum level of 0.5%, and has complemented this reduction with additional 
measures to boost the monetary impulse.  
A  second  key  element  in  this  scheme  is  the  floating  exchange  rate.  This  policy  favors 
stability,  allowing  the  real  exchange  rate  to  adjust  to  internal  economic  conditions  and 
minimizing output adjustments. Oftentimes, persistent attempts to prevent the exchange rate 
to  adjust  to  market  conditions  may  encourage  excessive  capital  flows  and  abrupt  foreign 
exchange adjustments that may complicate the conduct of monetary policy (figure 9). Thus, 
the  flexible  exchange  rate  we  have  in  place  facilitates  the  adjustment  as  long  as  it  is 
combined with a consistent macroeconomic policy and a solid and resilient financial system, 
as  we  have  in  Chile.  If  fiscal  and  monetary  policy  were  inadequate,  exchange  rate 
fluctuations  could  occur  that  would  exacerbate  macroeconomic  swings.  In  any  case,  our 
current  foreign  exchange  scheme  contemplates  the  possibility  of  intervening  in  the  market 
under exceptional circumstances, which we have done in the past. 
In  summary,  the  combination  of  a  flexible  exchange  rate,  a  prudent  fiscal  policy,  a  solid 
financial system and a monetary policy based on inflation targeting, contribute to stabilize the 
economy,  and  particularly  to  reduce  the  impact  of  copper  price  fluctuations  on  domestic 
activity.

Conclusions 
The effect on economic growth of natural resource abundance has been at the center of the 
world’s economic debate throughout the years. This issue is also greatly important for Chile, 
especially  because  of  our  mineral  resources  and  copper  ores.  As  international  research 
studies  have  found,  natural  resource  dependence  may  have  destabilizing  effects  on  the 
economy, and, hence, result in reduced growth. The critical connection between these two 
variables is institutions. When weak, the abundance of natural resources may have negative 
effects on macroeconomic stability and growth. But when the institutions and the policies are 
adequate, natural resources are an enormous source of benefits for the country, as copper 
has proven to be for Chile.  
The fiscal rule, the inflation targeting regime, and the floating exchange rate have cushioned 
the  impact  of  copper  price  swings  on  the  domestic  economic  cycle.  Therefore,  it  is  no 
surprise  that  in  the  past  few  years  economic  growth  was  slower  compared  to  previous 
copper price booms. This same stabilizing effect allowed the economy to grow by an average 
of over 3% in the early 2000s, when the price of copper was at is lowest level since the Great 
Depression.  Naturally,  our  economy  is  affected  by  international  events,  as  shown  by  the 
current  scenario.  However,  the  recent  experience  also  shows  something  that  is  not  only 
predictable  in  the  current  policy  framework  but  also  desirable:  less  dependence  of  the 
Chilean economic cycle on copper price fluctuations. Thank you very much.
