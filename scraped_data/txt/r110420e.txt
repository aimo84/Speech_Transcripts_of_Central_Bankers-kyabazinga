José De Gregorio: Chile’s latest Monetary Policy Report 
Presentation  by  Mr  José  De  Gregorio,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  of  the 
Monetary  Policy  Report  before  the  Finance  Commission  of  the  Honorable  Senate  of  the 
Republic, Santiago de Chile, 4 April 2011. 
The Monetary Policy Report of March 2011 can be found at http://www.bcentral.cl. 
 Introduction 
Mr.  President  of  the  Senate’s  Finance  Commission,  senator  Eduardo  Frei,  senators.  I  am 
grateful for the Commission’s invitation to the Board of the Central Bank of Chile to share 
with you our vision of recent macroeconomic developments, their prospects and implications 
on monetary policy, as detailed in our Monetary Policy Report of March 2011. 
The data at hand on the last few months show that our country continues to walk a path of 
sustained economic recovery. The year 2010 closed with a y-o-y growth rate of 5.2 percent, 
with very strong consumption and investment. To a large extent, the devastation inflicted on 
our  economy  by  the  world  recession  of  2008–2009  and  the  earthquake  and  tsunami  of 
27 February 2010 has been left behind. Employment is growing strongly and trend inflation 
has returned to above zero annual variation rates.  
The strong impulse of macroeconomic policies has been at the center of these results, and 
the  recovery  of  the  Chilean  economy  attests  to  the  efficacy  of  our  economic  policy 
framework.  However,  although  the  challenges  posed  by  the  aforesaid  events  have  been 
largely  overcome,  today  we  face  new  ones.  As  we  noted  in  the  presentations  we  made 
before  this  Commission  and  the  Senate  in  full  last  December,  the  world  economy  is 
undergoing  a  process  of  recovery  in  two  speeds,  generating  significant  foreign  exchange 
tensions.  
In early January the Board announced a program of foreign-currency purchases to alleviate 
these tensions and increase Chile’s international reserves to match those of other emerging 
economies. Such program involves the purchase of 12 billion US dollars over a period that 
ends in December this year. Three months into the process, the Bank has bought a little over 
3 billion dollars. The peso/dollar parity is now around 3 percent above the level that prevailed 
before the purchase announcement, fluctuating in the range of 465 to 500 pesos per dollar. 
The overall trends that have determined an appreciation of the currencies of most emerging 
economies  –  including  the  Chilean  peso  –  are  still  present.  We  believe  that  without  the 
intervention the peso would have appreciated even more.  
The  resolution  of  growth  imbalances  around  the  world  will  probably  take  some  time,  but 
sooner  or  later  the  differences  between  emerging  and  developed  economies  will  narrow, 
mitigating  pressures  on  our  currency.  Beyond 
in 
competitiveness that our country needs in order to remain on the path to development will be 
achieved not with actions that artificially increase the level of the nominal exchange rate, but 
rather  with  structural  reforms  that  will  improve  productivity  and,  therefore,  the  competitive 
stance of our exports.  
The many differences in the speed of the economic recovery in the world has combined with 
foreign exchange tensions and, in the past few months, increased inflationary pressures at 
the global level. Food prices, responding to the stronger demand of emerging economies and 
to worsened supply-side conditions, have skyrocketed, rising even faster than between early 
2007 and mid-2008. Add to this the sustained increase in the oil price since mid-2010, which 
intensified  last  February  because  of  the  political  unrest  in  the  Middle  East  and  Northern 
Africa.

Under these circumstances, today monetary policy faces an important challenge. Like after 
the  global  financial  debacle  of  2008,  when  it  was  highly  flexible  in  responding  to  the 
confidence crisis around the world, now it must again be flexible in withdrawing the monetary 
stimulus,  creating  the  conditions  for  sustainable  growth  and  acting  preventively  to  avoid  a 
resurgence  of  inflation.  Since  last  December,  the  Board  has  raised  the  monetary  policy 
interest  rate  (MPR)  by  75  basis  points  to  4  percent  in  the  meeting  of  last  March.  In  the 
scenario we consider the most likely, we will continue to remove the monetary stimulus, at a 
pace that will depend on unfolding macroeconomic conditions, but which will be principally 
oriented to achieving the inflation target. Now let me describe the factors that underlie the 
most likely scenario and the main risks it faces.  
Macroeconomic scenario 
In the last few months, y-o-y CPI inflation, in line with projections in December’s Report, has 
hovered  around  the  target,  with  an  annual  variation  of  2.7  percent  at  February.  Core 
indicators  have  returned  to  positive,  yet  still  low  (figure  1).  Nonetheless,  as  I  said,  even  if 
actual inflation continues to be aligned with the target and our previous forecasts, the latest 
developments have increased our concern for inflation, as they have in other economies. In 
the  emerging  world,  growth  has  proceeded  as  expected,  within  an  environment  where 
foreign exchange tensions remain and commodity prices continue on the rise, especially for 
oil and foodstuffs (figure 2). This latter phenomenon has shaped a scenario of higher inflation 
and, accordingly, higher expectations.  
Actual inflation has already begun rising in developed economies. In the U.S. it went from 
1.1 percent  annually  in  September  2010  to  2.1  percent  in  February  this  year,  and  in  the 
Eurozone it went from 1.9 percent to 2.4 percent over the same period. Worth noting is the 
behavior  of  inflation  in  the  U.K.,  where  it  has  been  above  the  2-percent  target  since 
December 2009 and now stands at somewhat more than 4 percent. Partly as a result of the 
wide  output  gaps  that  persist  in  these  economies,  core  inflation  remains  in  low  levels 
(figure 3).  Emerging  economies  have  seen  inflation’s  velocity  of  expansion  begin  rising, 
especially for core inflation in Asia. The higher international prices of foodstuffs have a strong 
impact  on  inflation  in  these  economies,  considering  that  they  weigh  more  in  their  CPI 
baskets. 
Inflation  forecasts  for  2011  have  been  raised  everywhere.  Worth  noting  is  the  case  of 
emerging  Asia,  where  by  mid-2010  the  market  consensus  expected  inflation  to  average 
3.8 percent annually this year, and revised it upward to 4.8 percent last March (figure 4). The 
baseline scenario assumes that during this year  the external inflation relevant to Chile will 
exceed December’s forecast.  
In this scenario, the central banks of several economies have either started or continued their 
monetary policy normalization processes, implying that inflation might be temporarily above 
their targets, which coincides with the market consensus expectations. Some of them have 
continued applying alternative measures to tone down increases in liquidity and credit, such 
as  China,  India,  Brazil  and  other  countries  in  the  region.  In  some  developed  economies, 
although monetary policy has remained very expansionary – with unconventional measures 
and record-low interest rates – policy makers have explicitly exposed their concerns about 
future  inflation  and  a  few  have  even  considered  the  option  of  beginning  their  cycle  of 
normalization  sooner.  Thus,  in  the  U.S.  and  Europe,  market  expectations  regarding  the 
timing of the process’s kick-off have changed (figure 5). 
Hence,  the  outlook  for  world  economic  growth  is  somewhat  brighter  than  it  was  last 
December.  Actual  output  data  in  developed  economies,  especially  in  the  U.S.,  have 
exceeded expectations and market consensus projections have been revised upwards. For 
2011, the world growth forecast assumed in this Report’s baseline scenario is three decimal 
points higher than in December. Financial tensions relating to the situation in some European 
2

economies are still in place. The catastrophe in Japan has sounded an alarm, but so far its 
effects are believed to be limited primarily to the Japanese economy (table 1).  
In Chile, output gaps have behaved as predicted, leading to a normalization of the inflation 
trend. As I said before, in 2010 GDP grew 5.2 percent, so we believe output gaps are closed 
(figure 6). The strength of domestic demand, particularly for consumption, has been at the 
center of this phenomenon. Labor gaps have narrowed, with a fast increase in employment 
and higher wages. 
This performance of the economy reflects to a great extent the impulse of monetary policy to 
domestic expenditure and the world’s economic recovery. For 2011, the Board foresees that 
GDP  growth  will  be  in  the  range  of  5.5  to  6.5  percent,  the  same  it  forecast  in  December 
(table  2).  This  scenario  is  coherent  with  output  gaps  remaining  closed  over  the  entire 
projection horizon.  
The recent dynamism of the economy  will moderate in line with the reduced impulse from 
macroeconomic  policies.  As  for  monetary  policy,  our  projections  use  as  a  working 
assumption  that  the  MPR  will  follow  a  path  that  is  comparable  with  the  one  that  can  be 
inferred  from  the  various  expectations  surveys  (figure  7).  For  the  case  of  fiscal  policy,  the 
working  assumption  is  that  fiscal  expenditure  will  increase  this  year  less  than  will  output, 
consistently with the recent announcement of the government on the matter, to subsequently 
converge  to  a  structural  deficit  of  1  percent  of  GDP  until  the  end  of  the  current 
Administration’s term.  
In the baseline scenario, the cyclical situation of the Chilean economy plus the withdrawal of 
the macroeconomic stimulus will result in y-o-y CPIX1 inflation moving from its present level 
of  around  0.5  percent  to  a  little  over  3  percent  in  the  early  part  of  2012  (figure  8).  It  is 
expected to then oscillate around the target until the end of the projection horizon, that is, the 
first quarter of 2013. Headline inflation, meanwhile, will surpass the upper bound of the target 
range,  largely  due  to  the  effects  of  higher  prices  of  oil  and  oil  derivatives.  The  baseline 
scenario assumes that the oil price will average somewhat more than 100 dollars per WTI 
barrel in the two-year period 2011–2012. Accordingly, annual CPI inflation will stand above 
4 percent  for  the  entire  second  half  of  this  year  and  into  2012.  For  December  2011,  it  is 
forecast  at  4.3  percent,  which  compares  with  3.3  percent  assumed  in  December.  Inflation 
projections  for  the  latter  part  of  this  year  have  been  revised  upward  in  many  economies 
around the world, even before the oil shock intensified (figure 9). As for the inflation forecast 
used  in  this  Report’s  baseline  scenario,  a  large  part  of  the  change  responds  to  the  direct 
impact  of  the  fuel  price  increase.  In  the  case  of  non-perishable  foodstuffs,  actual  inflation 
data  for  the  last  few  months  show  an  increase  that  reflects  December’s  projections.  The 
baseline  scenario  assumes  that  it  will  continue  to  rise  at  annual  rates  in  the  order  of  4  to 
5 percent during 2011 (figure 10). 
Thus, the Board foresees that annual CPI variation will return to the tolerance range during 
the second quarter of 2012 and will stay at 3 percent until the end of the year. This forecast 
assumes  that  the  propagation  of  price  increases  in  foodstuffs  and  oil  will  follow  historic 
experiences.  It  also  assumes  that  the  economy  will  grow  at  a  pace  consistent  with  its 
capacity, limiting the propagation of these shocks to other prices and to labor cost pressures. 
Private inflation expectations are similar to those described in the baseline scenario. March’s 
Economic  Expectations  Survey  (EES)  shows  an  inflation  rate  at  December  of  this  year  of 
4.4 percent. The Financial Operators Survey for the second half of March shows inflation one 
year ahead at 4.4 percent. These two figures are slightly higher than they were in December 
2010. For the medium term, expectations also rise and the EES of March foresees inflation 
two years ahead at 3.2 percent (figure 11). With respect to end-of 2010, breakeven inflation 
figures  derived  from  financial  asset  prices  have  also  increased  for  all  the  different  terms. 
Likewise,  business  and  consumer  confidence  surveys  show  increased  concerns  about 
inflation.

As usual, there are various risks that could shape a different macroeconomic scenario. On 
this  occasion,  the  Board  believes  the  risk  balance  for  both  inflation  and  output  is  biased 
upward. 
The main risk to inflation has to do with the size, persistence and propagation of the shock to 
commodity  prices,  especially  oil.  Internationally,  as  I  said,  the  baseline  scenario  assumes 
that  the  oil  price  will  be  high  and  fairly  stable.  However,  it  may  happen  that  the  political 
tensions in some oil-exporting countries continue or intensify, resulting in a steeper upward 
trend.  The  global  effects  of  such  a  setting  are  clearly  inflationary  in  the  immediate  future, 
while  further  down  the  line  its  combined  effects  on  world  demand  and  interest  rates  may 
moderate world economic activity (table 3). In the case of foodstuff prices, current aggregate 
indexes are above their peak of 2007–2008, although the composition of products showing 
the bigger increases differs. In any case, the velocity of these hikes has been greater than 
that of the last episode (figure 12). Both futures prices and analysts’ projections assume that 
the prices of these products will not increase further but will rather tend to normalize. Still, it 
cannot  be  ruled  out  that  if  supply-side  problems  in  the  agricultural  sector  persist  within  a 
context of strong growth in emerging economies, pressures on the prices of foodstuffs may 
be intensified.  
Regarding  the  internal  propagation  of  the  shock  to  commodity  prices,  food  prices  have 
increased  less  locally  than  internationally,  indicating  a  compression  of  margins  in  the 
industry. Overall, this compression reverses the expansion they posted in the second half of 
2008 and throughout 2009, after the fall in external prices (figure 13). However, it cannot be 
ruled out that, if international prices continue to rise, further effects on domestic inflation may 
be observed.  
As  for  oil,  due  to  conditions  inherent  in  this  market,  pass-through  to  consumer  prices  has 
been  instantaneous.  Facing  additional  shocks,  the  stabilization  system  in  place  could  help 
smooth short-term fluctuations in fuel prices. Nonetheless, it is not its objective, in a medium-
term  horizon,  to  isolate  local  price  movements  from  external  ones.  In  addition,  the  effects 
might  be  amplified  if  the  availability  of  hydroelectric  energy  diminishes  increasing  the 
dependence on thermal energy generation based on oil derivatives. Recall that in 2007–2008 
energy  prices  rose  considerably  because  of  an  electric  production  mix  that  was  more 
intensive in thermal generation at a time that the oil price was hitting record highs. Today, the 
marginal cost of electric generation is 25 percent below its peak of 2008 (figure 14). 
Another difference between the current situation and the episode of 2007–2008 has been the 
evolution  of  the  exchange  rate.  Whereas  then  the  exchange  rate  depreciated  continually, 
amplifying the effect of external price increases, in the past few months the peso-dollar parity 
has shown large swings, and is now, as of the statistical closing of this Report, at around 
CLP480 per dollar. After the Bank’s announcement of the reserve accumulation program in 
early  January,  the  peso  depreciated  from  some  CLP465  per  dollar  to  nearly  CLP500  per 
dollar. After that there was an appreciation trend that took it back to pre-intervention levels; 
however,  the  effects  of  this  measure  have  combined  with  external  developments,  in 
particular  the  sustained  weakness  of  the  dollar  at  the  global  level  and  the  copper  price 
increasing to all-time highs in nominal terms (figure 15). Thus, since its peak of late 2008, the 
appreciation  of  the  peso  against  the  U.S.  dollar  has  not  differed  much  from  that  of  the 
currencies  of  commodity-exporting  countries  or  other  economies  that  have  intervened  or 
applied administrative measures in their forex markets (figure 16). 
The  real  exchange  rate  (RER)  followed  the  trend  of  the  multilateral  parity,  which  has 
depreciated  since  December.  Considering  the  level  of  the  nominal  exchange  rate  and 
parities prevailing at the statistical closing of this Report, in March the RER posted figures in 
line with its long-term fundamentals (figure 17). The baseline scenario of this Report uses as 
a working assumption that the RER will stay near its recent levels. 
Regarding the propagation of the relative price shocks to the overall economy – or second-
round  effects  –  one  important  factor  is  significantly  related  with  the  sensitivity  of  inflation

expectations to the short-term behavior and the flexibility of real wages. It is possible that, if 
the  economy  sustains  its  dynamism  beyond  its  installed  capacity,  it  may  foster  a  greater 
propagation  of  these  shocks  to  other  prices  and  to  labor  costs,  heightening  its  inflationary 
effects. As I said before, the baseline scenario assumes that gaps will remain closed over the 
projection horizon, but the possibility remains that output and demand grow above forecasts, 
thus  exceeding  the  normal  use  of  the  economy’s  productive  capacity  and  exacerbating 
inflationary  pressures.  Conversely,  increased  prices  of  fuels  and  other  products  affect  the 
consumers’ disposable income and, thereby, can become a factor moderating expenditures 
in other goods and services. 
In  the  international  scenario,  financial  tensions  remain  in  some  European  countries  and 
global  imbalances  are  far  from  being  resolved.  There  are  also  doubts  regarding  how  tight 
output  gaps  are  and  how  strong  are  inflationary  pressures  in  some  emerging  economies, 
especially in Asia, and how will policy makers and investors respond to the signs of higher 
inflation that are appearing. Considering the experience of 2007–2008, this might trigger a 
monetary policy reaction that could cause a more pronounced slowdown in the demand of 
emerging economies, with important consequences on world growth and commodity prices. 
On the other hand, it is also possible that the different paces of recovery between emerging 
and developed economies and the exchange rate tensions in place result in a delay in the 
withdrawal of the monetary stimulus, causing an immediate increase in global inflation and 
calling for more aggressive monetary policy responses later on. 
Conclusions 
Today monetary policy conduct is facing an important challenge. Headline inflation is near 
the  target  and  trend  inflation  is  back  to  above-zero  figures,  albeit  still  substantially  below 
3 percent. However, inflationary pressures have increased globally raising inflation forecasts, 
spreading concerns about future inflation in the different economies, including our own. The 
recovery process of the Chilean economy has consolidated and output gaps are closed.  
As I said a while ago, the increases we have seen in international prices of foodstuffs and oil 
will result in total inflation surpassing the upper bound of the tolerance range during some 
quarters.  Our  main  task  today  is  to  ensure  that  the  convergence  of  trend  inflation  to  the 
target  occurs  with  as  few  setbacks  as  possible.  Monetary  policy  conduct  will  aim  at  the 
inflationary trend remaining in levels consistent with the tolerance range, so that towards the 
end of the projection horizon headline inflation stands around 3 percent.  
There are important risks, though. The recent experience with international price shocks has 
shown  that  preoccupation  per  se  will  not  solve  their  inflationary  consequences.  It  is 
absolutely  necessary  to  take  action  every  time  these  shocks  give  signs  that  they  may 
propagate  from  specific  sectors  to  the  rest  of  the  prices  in  the  economy.  Preventing  such 
propagation  is  the  primary  task  of  monetary  policy.  In  this  Report’s  baseline  scenario,  the 
foreseen trajectory of monetary policy meets this objective.  
In any case, as it has done in the past, the Board will adopt any necessary measures to deal 
with  events  altering  the  macroeconomic  scenario  and  the  inflationary  outlook.  As  our 
country’s economic history has shown, and reminded us unequivocally just a few years back, 
inflation  is  an  evil  that  hits  especially  hard  those  who  have  the  least  resources.  The  main 
contribution that the Central Bank can make to the country’s development is to keep inflation 
low and stable, paving the way for sustainable growth. Making today the necessary changes 
to  monetary  policy  will  avert  more  severe  adjustments  in  the  future  that  would  certainly 
increase  the  associated  social  costs.  Accordingly,  the  Board  will  continue  to  conduct 
monetary policy so that annual projected inflation into a two-year horizon stands at 3 percent. 
Thank you.
