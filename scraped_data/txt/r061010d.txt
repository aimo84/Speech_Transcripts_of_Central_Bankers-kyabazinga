 How have we performed 
Economic  growth  has  been  volatile  over  the  past  decades.  However,  there  have  been 
pockets of years where sustained high economic growth has been achieved. 
When benchmarked against Pacific economies and selected Asian economies, Fiji can do 
much better 
Factors that contribute to this lacklustre performance are: 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
Nevertheless, investment is growing 
However,  economic  growth  in  recent  years  is  being  driven  by  consumption  causing  some 
imbalances: 
o 
o 
Smallness/isolation 
Natural disasters 
Loss of preferential access 
Slow reforms 
Low productivity and efficiency 
Slow policy implementation 
Political instability 
Strong consumption demand is feeding through to our imports 
Unfortunately, at the same time our exports have not been performing well, thus 
widening our trade gap 
Services account is growing and is providing some relief to these imbalances 
However, it is still not enough to counter the increasing current account deficit and 
overall pressure on the balance of payments account 
o 
o 
Expansionary fiscal policy has supported economic growth in past years 
Inflow remains low 
Risks to sustainable growth 
Fiji faces several risks to sustainable economic growth 
Risk 1: Political instability 
Risk 2: Unsustainable debt levels 
o 
This  could  be  a  short-term  risk  if  the  government  reduces  its  deficit  and  we 
undertake reforms 
Risk 3: Stagnating exports and escalating imports is unsustainable 
o 
This could also be a short-term risk if we act now to remove the barriers to exports, 
look for import substitution where relevant and put in place policy measures now to 
dampen demand

 Fiscal – Government 
Monetary – Reserve Bank of Fiji 
Raised interest rates 
Tightened liquidity 
Issued credit guidelines 
Tightened borrowing limits by non-residents 
What policies are available to reduce these short term risks? 
The two major pillars of policy are: 
o 
o 
What has the RBF done? 
o 
o 
o 
o 
However, monetary policy is not enough because: 
o 
o 
o 
Hence,  monetary  and  fiscal  policies  must  work  together  and  share  the  burden  of 
sustainability 
Fiscal policy has a greater influence on the economy: 
o 
Fiscal decisions have an immediate impact 
o 
The impact is also greater than monetary policy 
While, the higher fiscal deficits in the past worked well to raise economic growth, we now 
need to relook at our strategy to secure sustainability 
Heavy reliance on monetary policy will result in further interest rate increases 
The full effect of interest rates on demand takes a long time 
Further interest rate hikes could slow and dampen investment 
What can we do to raise economic growth? 
We must have a consensus on growth and set ourselves as a nation an economic growth 
target 
Several recipes of achieving a 5 percent average growth are: 
a. 
b. 
Recipe 1: We need to set targets in our key resource sectors 
Recipe 2: We need to raise investment to 25% of GDP, especially through private 
sector investment 
Recipe 3:We need to accelerate reforms and not succumb to reform myths 
Recipe 4: We need to lift productivity 
c. 
d. 
This policy mix will: 
o 
o 
o 
o 
Sustain future prosperity 
Still raise growth to even higher level 
Create jobs 
Help us address social issues
