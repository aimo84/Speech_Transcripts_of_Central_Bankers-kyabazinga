Mr.  Davies  looks  at  whether  contemporary  forces  are  eroding  distinctions
between  central  banks  and  pushing  them  towards  some  common  model      Text  of  the
London School of Economic and Political Science Annual Lecture on Central Banking delivered
by the Deputy Goveror of the Bank of England, Mr. Howard Davies, on 4/3/97.
Central  bankers  are  famous  for  their  obsessive  concern  about  credibility  and
consistency.  By  that  token,  I  should  be  drummed  out  of  the  club  I  have  only  recently  joined.
Because when the Governor stood here a little over a year ago, he assured the audience that he
was  delivering  the  fourth  and  last  in  the  series  of  LSE  Bank  of  England  lectures.    But,  in
keeping with the usual practice of successful television shows, I am here tonight to open a new
series.    The  LSE  seemed  to  think  you  would  prefer  that  to  filling  the  schedule  hereafter  with
repeats.
This new series picks up where the last left off.  In 1996 the Governor noted there
is nowadays a broad consensus that the raison d’être of central banks everywhere is the pursuit
of  monetary  and  financial  stability;  but  he  observed  that  once  you  go  beyond  that  level  of
generality, each central bank is unique - in terms of  its  constitutional  position,  the  range  of  its
activities, its size, structure and organisation.  Many of these differences are the result of history.
The  question  I  plan  to  address  tonight  is  whether  contemporary  forces  are  eroding  these
distinctions between central banks and pushing them towards some common model.
I  shall  confine  myself  largely  to  what  is  happening  in  Europe.    The  increasing
globalisation of financial markets is one pressure for  change  across  the  world.    But  in  western
Europe,  the  Maastricht  Treaty  and  the  preparations  for  Economic  and  Monetary  Union  are
requiring  central  banks  to  review  their  statutes  and  to  align  their  operating  procedures.    But  I
also want to talk about the central banks of Eastern Europe.  They are feeling similar pressures -
several hope that their countries will accede to the European Union within five years or so - but
their origins are very different.
In  1989  most  of  the  state  banks  of  central  and  eastern  Europe  had  little
understanding  of  the  rôle  of  a  central  bank  in  a  market  economy.    Since  then  they  have  had
rapidly to acquire the knowledge and  skills  needed  to  tackle  acute  inflationary  pressures  while
many of their leading banks were effectively bankrupt.  At the Bank of England, we have been
actively  involved  in  helping  them  by  drawing  on  our  own  experience  as  central  bankers,
adapting the lessons we have ourselves learned over the years to the unique circumstances of the
transition economies.
Much of this effort has been channelled through our Centre for Central Banking
Studies which we established in 1990 to provide technical assistance and training to other central
banks.    We  have  given  advice  principally  on  core  functions  such  as  monetary  policy  and
operations,  the  development  of  money  markets  and  payment  systems,  the  management  of
government  debt,  and  banking  supervision;  but  our  help  has  also  been  sought  in  some  less
obvious matters such as the physical security of central bank buildings and their contents.  The
assistance is provided through our experts visiting other central banks and by their staff coming
on study visits to London, as well as through seminars and workshops here and abroad.
In  the  earlier  years  most  of  these  events  were  essentially  training  courses.    But
increasingly the participants from many countries are able to contribute more themselves to the
discussion so that they are now learning not only from our  own  experience  as  central  bankers,
BIS Review   33/1997
- 2 -
but also from each other.  And in some instances, their experience may well hold lessons for us.
Since  1990  over  4,000  staff  of  other  central  banks  -  two  thirds  of  them  from  the  transition
economies  -  have  participated  in  these  various  events.    The  work  of  the  Centre  for  Central
Banking Studies, and the other inter-bank links we maintain (notably between supervisors) give
us, I believe, a privileged perspective on the development of central banking across Europe.  The
analysis below - particularly the Eastern European sections - is very largely the work of Lionel
Price, the Centre’s Director, and his staff.
History is important
In  a  study1  published  by  the  LSE’s  Financial  Markets  Group  last  year,  Rosa
Maria  Lastra  concludes  that  central  banks  are  not  “natural  products”  but  products  of  history.
She emphasises the special relationships whereby central banks have been consciously awarded
privileges by governments, and have been expected to provide certain services and functions in
return.    This  may  seem  a  dubious  process,  like  selling  monopolies.    But  central  banking,  she
kindly says, is not an “evil”:  that comes as a relief to some of us.  Though a product of history,
and  a  creature  favoured  by  the  state,  a  central  bank  may  serve  useful  economic  goals  in  the
pursuit of stable money and sound banking.  While most of their functions could be fulfilled by
a  different  public  or  private  institution,  central  banks  are  today  typically  seen  as  convenient
instruments for the conduct of both monetary policy and banking supervision.
I  agree  with  Dr  Lastra’s  conclusions.    Moreover,  central  banks’  differing
historical  origins  influence  not  only  the  tasks  they  carry  out  today,  but  also  the  way  in  which
they think and operate.  The Bank of England was established to lend money to the government;
and though the Maastricht Treaty now prohibits any buying of  British  government  debt  by  the
Bank of England in the primary market, the Bank still manages government funding operations
in an essentially agency capacity (and the present Governor first came to public prominence in
this area!).  By contrast, the origin of the Federal Reserve Banks in the USA lay in the provision
of  a  reliable  nation-wide  payment  and  depository  system,  and  that  remains  a  central  activity.
While some banking supervision is conducted by the Fed, that  is  largely  the  remit  of  (myriad)
other  institutions  (the  Office  of  the  Comptroller  of  the  Currency,  banking  regulators  in  each
separate state and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation).
The  Bundesbank  was  set  up  against  a  background  of  the  need  to  restore  and
maintain  a  stable  currency,  and  this,  together  with  the  concomitant  political  independence,
remain at the heart of its rôle.  An early strong belief in the “real bills” doctrine still influences
the  Bundesbank’s  views  on  appropriate  collateral  for  central  bank  operations  with  the  market,
and justifies its large branch network and staff.  The Banque de France has retained more retail
banking  than  most  other  modern  central  banks,  maintaining  branches  in  every  French
département  (a  network  it  has  found  difficult  to  slim  down  in  face  of  local  and  trades  union
opposition).  It also makes use of its branches in compiling a centrale des risques, a register of
commercial bank lending, and in keeping track of the million or so individuals who have drawn
bad cheques!  The Bank of Japan is more of a medley.  Its rôle model when it was established in
1882 was, you may be surprised to hear, the Banque Nationale de Belgique, though some aspects
of English banking practice were also adopted.  Legislation in 1942 followed the then German
model,  particularly  in  making  the  Bank  of  Japan  subservient  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance;  and
after the war, there was American influence.

In Figures 1 and 2, I have attempted to capture some of the distinctions between
these  leading  central  banks.    (Because  I  am  concentrating  on  distinctions,  I  have  omitted
common tasks - such as the issuance of  banknotes and acting as banker for government - which
are carried out by virtually all central banks.)  Figure 1 shows the UK’s  “scores”  in five areas,
while Figure 2 adds in, by way of comparison, the other G5 countries.  Mapping the distinctions
is  not  an  easy  task.    For  instance,  though  in  Germany    a  government  office  is  responsible  for
banking  supervision,  it  is  central  bank  staff  who  undertake  much  of  the  day-to-day  work  of
monitoring  individual  banks.    In  France,  supervision  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Commission
Bancaire, but its secretariat is effectively part of the Banque de France, and the Governor chairs
it.  And in Japan, the central bank closely monitors the large banks, though the responsibility for
supervision formally rests with the finance ministry.  Furthermore, the extent of a country’s total
financial regulatory effort encompassed by the term ‘banking supervision’ varies - most British
banks  have  set  up  separate  subsidiaries  for  their  trading  activity,  regulated  by  securities
regulators  (though  the  responsibility  for  consolidated  supervision  remains  with  the  Bank  of
England); by contrast, European banks tend to retain trading within the banking entity.
It  is  also  not  always  apparent  whether  the  central  bank  is  in  practice  free  to  set
interest  rates  to  achieve  the  monetary  policy  objectives  which  derive  from  its  own  statutes  or
from objectives set by government.  The Bundesbank clearly has that freedom; and the other EU
member  states  have  been  legislating  in  accordance  with  the  Maastricht  Treaty  to  give  their
central banks independence in the field of monetary policy.  In Britain, even though there have
been  very  welcome  improvements  in  the  transparency  of  monetary  policy  formulation  since
1992,  decisions  on  interest  rates  remain  clearly  with  the  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  though
now  within  a  clear  inflation  target  framework.    In  Japan  the  position  is  under  review.    The
ultimate  authority  on  interest  rates  has  rested  legally  with  the  Minister  of  Finance,  though
according  to  Goodhart,  Capie  and  Schnadt  “it  is  widely  understood  that  it  would  be
extraordinary  if  the  government  resorted  to  these  provisions,  and  they  have  never  been
enacted”.2  The same authors conclude that the Bank of Japan “has thus enjoyed independence in
practice”.      What  is  harder  to  judge  is  the  extent  to  which  the  Bank  of  Japan’s  decisions  may
have been influenced at times by recognition of the latent ministerial powers.
Notwithstanding those nuances, what can be seen from Figure 2 is that the Bank
of England is quite distinctive amongst the five leading industrial countries.  We have:
    the least independence in setting interest rates;
the  most  comprehensive  responsibility  for  banking  supervision  (though
some other banks have broader financial regulatory responsibilities);
the  greatest  role  in  managing  government  debt  -  we  provide  substantial
policy input as well as actually handling auctions as issuing agent for the
Treasury;
the smallest branch  network  -  we  have  consciously  reduced  the  scope  of
our  private  banking  activities  in  recent  years  (focusing  on  areas  of

comparative  advantage  as  a  public  sector  institution)  and  are  now  also
leaving note distribution to be handled largely by the private banks;
 a  comparatively  limited  but  increasing  role  in  the  operation  of  payment
and  settlement  systems  -  typically,  the  Bank  of  England  participates  in
payments  systems  which  are  run  by  the  private  sector,  and  has  only
involved  itself  in  the  establishment  and  operation  of  settlement  systems
when  the  private  sector  has  not  itself  succeeded  in  doing  so.    Recently,
however, the introduction of CREST and RTGS, and the European work
on TARGET, has expanded on our work considerably.
These  maps  cannot  easily  convey  a  sense  of  the  dynamics  of  change  in  central
banking.  Central banks are evolving creatures, which respond to political and economic forces
around  them. 
  One  unusually  powerful  force,  which  will  change  their  environment
fundamentally, is EMU.  But before considering its impact, I would like to consider the state of
play  in  the  rest  of  (non-EU)  Europe,  where  exciting  transformations  of  a  different  kind  have
occurred in the last decade.
Turning socialist state banks into central banks
The  central  banks  of  the  formerly  planned  economies  of  central  and  eastern
Europe have generally developed important responsibilities in each of my five areas (Figure 3).
The  old  state  banks  have  been  transformed  to  fill  the  vacuum  left  by  the  dissolution  of  the
mechanisms  and  institutions  of  a  planned  economy.    Most  had  extensive  branch  networks  and
already operated rudimentary payment systems - though transfers often relied on correspondent
banking  relationships  and  slow  and  unreliable  postal  systems.    But  under  the  old  regime  there
was little if any requirement for the other functions - setting interest rates, managing government
debt, and supervising banks.  Instead the main roles of the state banks had been the provision of
banknotes;  and  making  the  financial  transfers  between  state  enterprises  inherent  in  the  central
economic plans.  The perceived importance of cash, and the bookkeeping culture, still influence
to  varying  degrees  their  successor  institutions.    But  these  banks  have  been  hit  by  a  series  of
powerful shocks.
(i)  Monetary policy
The  first  is  the  shift  from  centralised  control  of  the  economy  to  a  market-based
system.  Instead of directing money to meet enterprises’ deficits - a job which required a large
branch network and hordes of bureaucrats - the aim is to influence the behaviour of the economy
by using indirect instruments of  monetary  policy  to  guide  interest  rates  and  the  exchange  rate,
and  to  conduct  the  prudential  supervision  of  the  new  commercial  banks.    But  many  of  the
bureaucrats find it difficult to work out which bits of information they need and how often, and
prefer instead to demand a substantial volume of data without prioritisation.  Some of the staff
of  eastern  European  central  banks,  used  to  passing  on  raw  data  which  can  be  checked  against
enterprises’  targets,  find  it  difficult  to  analyse  information  with  the  aim  of  learning  something
about the behaviour of markets, consumers or firms.  The simple questions, “Why are we doing
this?”, “What does this mean?” can be too hard to ask.  New goals, however well-enshrined in
the constitution and law, do not change culture overnight.
BIS Review   33/1997

The  second  culture  shock  has  been  the  move  from  a  monobank  to  a  two-tier
banking system.  The old system had two separate monetary circuits - one for cash (used mainly
by individuals) and the other in transfers between bank accounts (used by enterprises).  One of
the  early  tasks  of  western  advisers  was  to  try  to  convince  the  would-be  central  bankers  in  the
east that monetary policy was not just a matter of regulating the supply of banknotes.  And many
of  the  same  people  found  it  difficult  to  accept  that  the  provision  of  credit  by  a  central  bank  -
whether to government or to enterprises - is likely to have inflationary consequences.  When the
basic  problem  is  a  shortage  of  national  savings  (often  because  the  state  is  pre-empting  private
savings  through  its  budget  deficit  and  off-budgetary  spending),  the  central  bank  cannot
magically  create  extra  real  resources  by  relaxing  monetary  policy.    Were  it  so,  we  central
bankers would be even more popular people than we are now.
The  response  of  the  eastern  European  and  CIS  central  banks  to  their  new  goals
has been tempered by a number of factors:
     how long the old culture had prevailed;
how democratic the new regime is (independent central banks do not get
on well with autocracies);
the size of the country;
the  availability  of  foreign  currency  to  the  government,  whether  from
export  revenues  (oil  or  gas)  or  loans  from  international  financial
institutions; and
in the case of the ten (yes, ten!) applicants from the region to join the EU,
how quickly they believe they need to move into line.
The differences between these central banks are perhaps most marked in relation
to  monetary  policy  and  financial  relations  with  the  government.    The  westernmost  of  the
transition  countries  have  typically  liberalised  the  most,  adopting  policies  and  structures  which
are already very close to those of their EU neighbours;
while,  further  East,  reform  and  market-based  operations  are  still  viewed  with
some  scepticism  (everyone  of  course  pays  lip  service  to  the  benefits  of  and  need  for  market
reform and structural adjustment, but many do not in their hearts believe it will work for them),
and  the  markets  that  have  been  introduced  are  subjected  to  discretionary  administrative
controls - particularly in crises.
Partly because of the influence of the IMF and other western advisers as well as,
in  the  case  of  EU  applicants,  the  need  to  harmonise  with  EU  law  and  practice,  the  legislation
governing  the  new  central  banks  usually  follows  a  common  model,  giving  them  autonomy  to
pursue  an  objective  of  monetary  stability.    What  is  interesting  is  that  the  aspects  of  monetary
control  whose  merits  we  debate  in  the  west  -  the  degree  of  independence  of  the  central  bank,
inflation  targets  versus  monetary  targets,  fixed  or  floating  exchange  rates  -  have  in  terms  of
results been of secondary importance to the understanding and acceptance of the case for reform
on the  part  of  the  public,  parliament  and  government.    There  is  little  benefit  to  a  central  bank
BIS Review   33/1997
- 6 -
being independent of government if the parliament is able to force it to grant subsidised credits
to favoured sectors.  And independence counts for little if the government persists in running a
deficit while non-monetary means to finance it have yet to be developed.
If  we  look  at  five  of  the  central  European  countries  where  reform  is  most
advanced - the Czech and Slovak Republics, Slovenia, Hungary and Poland - the first two have
succeeded  in  bringing  annual  inflation  down  to  single  figures,  while  inflation  in  Hungary  and
Poland  is  just  below  20%.    All  except  Hungary  monitor  an  intermediate  monetary  target,  but
these targets have proved unreliable friends in the transitional economies generally.  It has been
far from easy to predict the velocity of money when the economic and financial structure is in
turmoil.  The more important success factor appears to be exchange rate policy.  The Czechs and
Slovaks  have  been  able  to  hold  their  exchange  rates  fixed  against  a  Deutsche  Mark/US  dollar
basket.  This has not been sufficient to deliver the inflation rates of 1-3 % seen in Germany and
the  United  States,  as  the  transition  economies  are  experiencing  faster  rates  of  growth  in
productivity in tradables; they need to permit their currencies to appreciate if they are to lower
their  inflation  rates  further.    But  their  fixed  exchange  rates  have  cemented  and  enhanced  the
credibility of the sound monetary and budgetary policies being followed.
Yet fixing the exchange rate is not the only route to lowering inflation.  Slovenia
has succeeded with a managed float, though a key factor has been its willingness to keep  their
real  exchange  rate  relatively  high.    In  contrast,  Hungary  and  Poland  have  tried  to  prevent  the
inevitable  real  appreciation  of  their  currencies  by  continually  depreciating  their  nominal
exchange  rates  in  reflection  of  their  higher  rates  of  inflation.    Polish  policy  became  less
accommodating last year, and Hungary may be set to follow.
Of  course,  an  exchange  rate  peg  is  far  more  credible  if  a  country  has  sizeable
foreign  exchange  reserves.    The  Baltic  states  were  fortunate  in  this  respect  as  they  regained
access to the gold held by their central banks in London and Paris before the War;  and Estonia
and Lithuania have gone as far as to fix their exchange rates rigidly in a currency board system
which removes discretion from monetary policy.  (Note that these countries too are experiencing
real appreciation: annual inflation is nearly 15% despite their fixed exchange rates.)  The IMF is
now  encouraging  Bulgaria  to  follow  suit  and  adopt  a  currency  board  as  the  central  bank  there
has not been able to impose a sufficiently tight monetary policy in the face of lack of progress
on other aspects of reform.  But the currency board can only succeed as part of a comprehensive
package of fiscal and structural measures.  The strict monetary policy rules of a currency board
can work well if fiscal policy is highly responsible - or will become so as a result of the currency
board; if not, it may put severe strains on the banking system, as has been the case in the Baltic
states.
(ii)
Banking supervision
This  potential  conflict  between  monetary  policy  and  maintaining  the  stability  of
the  banking  system  is  not  one  which  has  greatly  troubled  most  western  industrial  countries  in
recent  years.    But  in  some  transition  economies,  such  conflicts  have  been  real.    In  most,  the
problem  has  not  been  so  much  to  maintain  the  stability  of  the  banking  system  as  to  create  a
robust banking system from a  number of often insolvent state-owned banks spun off from the
old monobank, together with newly created commercial banks whose  behaviour  has  frequently
been far from prudent.
BIS Review   33/1997
- 7 -
In  contrast  to  the  diverse  arrangements  in  the  west,  banking  supervision  in
transition  economies  is  nearly  always  the  responsibility  of  the  central  bank  (although  in  some
cases  the  Ministry  of  Finance  is  also  involved  in  the  licensing  of  banks).    An  exception  is
Hungary, where supervisory responsibilities have in large measure been transferred to the State
Banking  Supervision  Office:  the  central  bank  is  nominally  responsible  only  for  monitoring
banks’ liquidity and foreign exchange positions, although in practice its role extends rather more
widely.
In most of the countries - especially in those with hopes of acceding soon to the EU - banking
legislation  approximating  to  western  standards  is  (or  is  about  to  be)  in  place.    But  in  practice,
banking supervision has proved a difficult topic to master.  Whereas monetary policy requires a
highly  trained  but  small  cadre  of  economists  in  the  head  office  of  the  central  bank,  large
numbers of supervisors are needed, often spread across the country, to deal with a multitude of
new  banks  with  poor  quality  accounts.    And  the  skills  of  assessing  risk  and  the  quality  of
management  have  not  always  come  easily  to  staff  from  a  bookkeeping  background  whose
instincts  are  to  tick  boxes  rather  than  make  judgements.    Staff  who  have  acquired  the  skills
needed are frequently enticed away to work for commercial banks at higher salaries.
(iii)  Managing government debt
Another field in  which  central  and  eastern  European  central  banks  are  generally
more heavily involved than their western counterparts is in the management of government debt.
(Hungary,  where  there  is  a  separate  debt  office  under  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  broadly  on  the
Irish  model,  is  again  an  exception.)    Under  the  old  regimes  governments  relied  on  their  state
banks for finance, but the new statutes of the central banks - usually following an IMF model -
limit  the  provision  of  finance  to  government.    Ceilings  are  mostly  around  5%  of  government
revenues,  though  in  Estonia  and  Lithuania  they  are  zero.    With  monetary  financing  restricted,
new  methods  of  financing  governments  have  had  to  be  developed  and  nearly  all  the  central
banks have taken a leading part in this process.
Even  where  the  government’s  own  financing  needs  have  been  small,  as  in  the
Czech Republic, central banks have been keen to establish markets in short-term paper in which
they  can  conduct  monetary  operations.    Several  of  them    have  issued  their  own  bills  for  this
purpose,  particularly  where  in  the  early  years  the  finance  ministry  was  reluctant  to  issue
government  paper.    Whether  the  market  being  developed  is  in  government,  central  bank  or
private paper, the central banks have had to strike a difficult balance in deciding how frequently
to  intervene  in  the  markets.    In  the  absence  of  intervention,  a  market  can  remain  illiquid  and
unused.    But  if  the  central  bank  intervenes  too  much  and  holds  prices  too  steady,  then  private
market-makers  will  not  develop.    This  dilemma  is  not  unique  to  transition  countries.    Similar
dilemmas arise elsewhere, and some western central banks still sometimes play a role, if only a
marginal one, in balancing supply and demand in the domestic securities and foreign exchange
markets.
(iv)  Payment and settlement systems
One  area  of  activity  in  which  the  new  central  banks  do  mirror  the  diversity  of
their western counterparts is in responsibility for payment and settlement systems.  Of the nine
central banks in central  and  eastern  Europe,  five  operate  the  main  clearing  system  themselves.
In the other four countries the position is roughly as it is here, with the central bank participating
BIS Review   33/1997
- 8 -
in, and providing final settlement for, a privately owned clearing system.  In Russia the central
bank  has  been  slow  to  develop  its  own  payment  system,  and  commercial  banks  have  been
putting parallel mechanisms in place.    In  the  west,  technological  developments  and  a  desire  to
reduce systemic risks have been drawing central banks like ourselves into greater involvement in
payment and settlement services,  especially  in  the  provision  of  real-time  gross  settlement.    No
doubt the central banks in the transition economies will feel the same pressures before long.
(v)  Branch networks
On the last of my five metrics of central bank functions - the  size  of  the  branch
network  (which  I  use  as  a  convenient  proxy  for  the  extent  of  their  involvement  in  straight
banking activities and in note distribution) - the transition central banks occupy an intermediate
position.  The extensive branch networks of the monobanks went largely  to  the  savings  banks,
and in some case they have been turned into commercial banks.  The result has been surprisingly
consistent across central and eastern Europe, with one branch remaining for every ½ - 1 million
people  (except  for  the  Bank  of  Estonia  which  has  no  branches,  a  scrupulous  qualification).
Some of the new central banks are even now questioning, as we have done, whether they need
branches  -  as  distinct  from  regional  agencies  -  at  all.    Following  the  setting  up  of  a  State
Treasury, the Hungarian central bank has closed more than half its branches.
Obviously  the  political  structure  and  geography  of  the  country  is  material.    In  the  USA  and
Germany,  the  maintenance  of  a  branch  network  reflects  the  federal  structure  of  the  state.  In
Russia, a federal state with a very large geographical area, the Central Bank has sixty territorial
branches  and  nineteen  regional  banks  -  apparently  rather  modest  numbers  for  a  country  with
some  150  million  people  spread  across  ten  time  zones.    But  in  addition  the  CBR  in  1994  ran
1,356 cash and settlement centres, 13 banking schools, and 30 “other organisations”.  To run this
empire the bank employed over 52,000 staff, having created over 7,000 additional  posts  in  the
previous two years to conduct its various new functions.
Central bank staffing and costs
All this shows that, even though all European central banks face similar pressures,
the solutions remain quite diverse.  That is reflected in relative costs.  Comparable data are hard
to come by, but the Bank of Russia appears to have more staff per head of population than any
other.  The People’s Bank of China is larger, employing some 150,000 people (but only 1,000 in
head office where policy is centralised), but considering the PBoC’s continuing role as banker to
the state-owned enterprises that looks small in relation to a population of 1.2 billion.  Other very
large central banks are the Reserve Bank of India with 32,000 staff and the US Federal Reserve
System with 25,000.
One would expect the number of staff employed by a central bank to depend not
just on the population of the country (and in this there should be some economies of scale) but
also on the range of tasks it has and how efficiently it conducts them.  At the Bank of England
we take a lot of interest in comparative efficiency:  we are determined to be a value for money
central bank, and benchmark ourselves against others wherever possible.  Some of the data we
use are confidential:  central banks are more candid with each other in private than they are in
public.    But  there  are  a  few  published  measures.    A  study  in  1995  by  Fry,  Goodhart  and
BIS Review   33/1997
- 9 -
Almeida3  of  a  sample  of  30  central  banks,  largely  from  developing  countries,  tested  twelve
variables  as  possible  explanations  of  non-supervisory  staff  numbers.    Most  significant  was  a
country’s  population,  with  an  elasticity  of  one  half,  confirming  substantial  economies  of  scale
across  the  sample  countries.    There  were  positive  relationships  with  real  per  capita  income
(central banking appears to be a luxury good!), the number of branches, and the use of exchange
controls (both of which would increase staff needs).  Perhaps surprisingly the more independent
central  banks  seemed  to  employ  fewer  staff  (perhaps  that  could  be  the  basis  of  an
accommodation  with  Gordon  Brown!).    Amongst  the  variables  which  showed  no  relationship
was the inflation rate (though there could be a simultaneity problem here).
Figure  4  shows  the  numbers  of  staff  employed  two  or  three  years  ago  by  the
central  banks  of  various  industrial  countries  and  some  of  the  transition  economies.    There  is
clearly the expected positive relationship with population, but the ratio varies hugely: a central
bank on the highest of the three  parallel  lines  has  ten  times  the  staff  per  million  population  as
one on the lowest line.  The extent of this dispersion is more apparent in Figure 5 which shows
the  number  of  staff  per  million  population  for  the  large  countries.    With  only  around  3,500
people - down by more than 50% over the last twenty years and still falling fast - the Bank of
England itself is one of the most modestly staffed in relation to its population.  In contrast to the
significant  results  found  by  Fry  et  al.  from  their  sample  of  developing  countries,  regression
analysis on the industrial country data shows only weak evidence of small economies  of  scale.
Nor  did  other  variables  tested  on  industrial  countries  yield  any  significant  results.    As  for  the
transition economies, their staff numbers generally conform to those in industrial countries with
similar populations.  The exception is the Bank of Russia, whose staff looks  abnormally  large.
Some of these central banks are still growing as they seek to carry out their new functions; but
one or two, like the National Bank of Hungary, are already reviewing what they are doing and
how they do it, and are slimming down.  By the end of this year, they expect to have 40% fewer
staff than two years ago.
These variations in staff numbers naturally have an impact on the running costs of
central banks, but relative salary levels and non-staff costs are obviously also important.  Figure
6 is based on data for 1992, taken from central banks’ Annual Reports.  The vertical axis shows
the  gross  operating  costs  of  each  central  bank  as  a  percentage  of  GDP.    The  horizontal  axis
shows population.  For a swathe of countries across the bottom of the chart - from New Zealand
at 0.06% through Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Australia (0.04 - 0.05%)
to Britain (0.037%) and Canada and the United States at 0.03% - there may be some scale effect,
but several European countries do not fit this model at all.  The central banks of Italy and France
- countries with the same population as the UK - then cost 5 and 3.5 times more than us, and the
picture has changed little since.  Some of the differences may be down to national culture, but
another factor may be that the funds at the disposal of the different central  banks  vary  widely.
In  particular,  I  suspect  that  some  of  our  relative  cheapness  may  be  attributable  to  the  Bank
Charter  Act  of  1844,  since  which  time  the  seignorage  on  our  banknote  issue  has  been  passed
directly  and  immediately  to  the  government.    This  is  not  generally  the  case  abroad,  at  least  in
European  countries  -  west  or  east  -  where  profits,  a  fraction  of  seignorage,  are  passed  only
periodically to government.  (The UK is also unusual in that foreign exchange reserves, and any
profits earned on them, belong to the government rather than  to  the  central  bank,  although  the
Bank of England does of course have responsibility for managing the reserves).

Looking at the European continent as a whole, it  is  interesting  that,  whereas  the
common  history  of  central  and  eastern  European  countries  over  the  last  half  century  has
produced  broadly  similar  central  banks  in  the  different  countries  -  at  least  in  those  which  are
contemplating accession to the European Union - the central banks of the existing member states
are  a  disparate  bunch.    What  remains  to  be  seen  is  how  far  the  advent  of  Economic  and
Monetary  Union  may  induce  more  homogeneity  and,  indeed,  reduce  costs.    It  ought  to  be  the
case, after all, that one monetary policy is cheaper to administer than 15, or 25.
The European Central Bank will appear a much more concentrated creature than
the  central  banks  we  have  been  looking  at.    It  will  be  responsible  for  the  issuance  of  euro
banknotes  (known  to  the  cognoscenti  as  bridging  finance)  but  beyond  this,  in  terms  of  the
diagram I have been using, the ECB will be almost uni-dimensional (figure 7).  According to the
Maastricht Treaty its independence in setting interest rates will be unparalleled.  But it will not
supervise banks (not even as an agent) and it will not manage government debt.  It is agreed that
those functions will remain firmly with the national  central  banks  (or  other  relevant  agencies).
In payment systems the ECB will be responsible for only the tip of the iceberg, that is TARGET,
the  system  linking  the  various  national  payment  systems  of  EU  member  states.    This  narrow
focus  is  no  accident:  the  ECB’s  task  is  to  maintain    monetary  stability,  and  its  design  reflects
that.    The  European  System  of  Central  Banks,  collectively,  will  do  much  more  than  that,  of
course.
Discussions  between  EU  central  banks  on  how  monetary  policy  will  operate
within the EMU are well advanced, and the European Monetary Institute  published  a  report  in
January setting out what is agreed and what remains to be decided.  In principle, the creation of
the ECB in 1998 (in advance of Stage III) or thereafter need not affect the other activities of EU
central banks, whether they are in or out of the euro-area, provided they do not conflict with the
ECB’s achievement of monetary stability.  But it seems very likely that some of the activities of
the national central banks, and especially those who are members of the euro-area, will change
character  as  EMU  develops  (if  it  does).    That  is  partly  because  questions  will  undoubtedly  be
asked about costs.  One American commentator has recently pointed out that the total cost of the
US Federal Reserve system today is well under a third of the total costs of EU central banks.  On
that issue, as I have demonstrated, I believe we at the Bank of England have a good story to tell.
But the introduction of the euro would also have major implications for payments systems and
financial markets generally, which are bound to push national central banks closer together.  At
the  same  time,  functions  further  from  the  core  of  central  banking,  and  especially  those  which
could be performed as well or better by the private sector, are likely to move out of the central
banks.
As  for  monetary  policy,  if  you  will  permit  me  one  last  quotation,  one  which
should appeal to this audience, Alex Cukierman said in his extensive study of  central  banking,
“A  governor  who  is  backed  by  an  absolutely  and  relatively  strong  research  department  carries
BIS Review   33/1997
- 11 -
more weight vis-à-vis the Treasury and other branches of government”.4  The same will be true
within the European System of Central Banks, so I envisage national central banks keeping their
capacity to analyse the state of their domestic economy.  However, it ought to be possible, over
time,  for  the  ins  to  capture  some  economies  of  scale,  and  to  develop  centres  of  excellence  in
central banks around the Union, with expertise in particular areas of work.  It is unlikely to make
sense to have 15 (and certainly not 25) teams of economists analysing the causes of changes in
the velocity of euroM4.
But  I  do  not  wish  to  give  the  impression  that  EMU,  even  if  it  comes  about  on
something  roughly  approaching  the  current  timetable,  will  be  the  ‘end  of  history’  as  far  as
European central banking is concerned.  I suspect that central banks in Europe will continue to
display  great  diversity,  and  will  continue  to  evolve  in  different  directions,  and  at  different
speeds,  in  response  to  the  characteristics  of  their  local  habitat.    What  is  important  is  that  they
should be responsive, learning and self-critical organisations, ready to react quickly to changing
circumstances.  They must also, in my view, display their accountability, perhaps more so than
in the past.  With the greater responsibilities which European central banks, East and West, have
assumed in recent years, comes a greater need to explain the basis on which decisions are made,
and to account for the resources deployed in making those decisions.  That accountability runs
partly  to  the  Treasury,  who  exercise  financial  discipline  over  us,  partly  to  Parliament  -  whose
growing  interest  in  our  affairs  we  welcome  -  and  partly  to  the  broader  community.    I  see  this
series  of  lectures  fitting  within  that  context,  and  have  been  pleased  this  evening  to  have  the
opportunity  to  set  out  some  more  recent  reflections,  from  within  the  Bank,  on  the  way  we
exercise our functions on the people’s behalf.
