I. Recent Economic and Price Developments 
A. Overseas Economies 
I would like to begin my speech by talking about overseas economies. 
 Overseas economies have continued to grow at a moderate pace on the whole in a situation 
where  an  improving  trend  in  the  business  sentiment  of  manufacturing  firms  has  been 
strengthening further on a global basis.   
 The U.S. economy has continued to recover firmly, mainly in household spending, owing to 
a  steady  improvement  in  the  employment  and  income  situation.  Private  consumption  and 
housing  investment  have  been  on  a  moderate  increasing  trend,  partly  supported  by  this 
favorable employment and income situation.  In terms of the outlook, the U.S. economy is 
expected to continue to see firm growth driven by domestic private demand.   
 The  European  economy  as  a  whole  also  has  continued  to  recover  steadily  in  a  situation 
where  private  consumption  has  been  on  an  increasing  trend,  partly  supported  by 
improvements  in  the  labor  market  and  consumer  sentiment,  and  firms'  production  activity 
has  been  solid.  As  for  the  outlook,  the  European  economy  is  expected  to  continue  its 
moderate  recovery,  while  uncertainty  --  for  example,  over  political  issues  such  as  those 
regarding  negotiations  on  the  United  Kingdom's  exit  from  the  European  Union  (EU)  --  is 
likely to weigh on its activity.   
 The  Chinese  economy  has  continued  to  see  stable  growth  on  the  whole,  partly  due  to  the 
effects of authorities' measures to support economic activity, amid an uptrend in exports. As 
for the outlook, the economy is likely to broadly follow a stable growth path as authorities 
conduct fiscal and monetary policy in a timely manner.   
 Emerging  economies  other  than  China  and  commodity-exporting  economies  as  a  whole 
have  been  recovering  moderately,  due  mainly  to  the  increase  in  exports  and the  effects  of 
the  economic  stimulus  measures  of  these  economies.  Their  growth  rates  are  likely  to 
increase  gradually,  due  mainly  to  the  effects  of  the  economic  stimulus  measures  and  the 
spread of the effects of steady growth in advanced economies. 
1 
According  to  the  January  2018  World  Economic  Outlook  (WEO)  Update  released  by  the 
International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  global  growth  is  projected  to  be  3.9  percent  in  2018, 
exceeding  the  estimate  for  2017  of  3.7  percent  (Chart  1).  Together  with  high  stock  prices 
worldwide, the economy could deviate upward from the baseline scenario depending on the 
developments  in  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  and  structural  reforms  in  each  country. 
However,  due  attention  should  be  paid  to  factors  that  could  exert  downside  risks  to 
economic  activity,  such  as  (1)  the  U.S.  economic  policies  and  their  impact  on  global 
financial markets, (2) developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies, (3) 
negotiations  on  the  United  Kingdom's  exit  from  the  EU  and  their  effects,  and  (4) 
geopolitical risks. I consider it important to also focus on the following: the fact that spreads 
for U.S. high-yield bonds have narrowed in the U.S. economy to a level close to that seen 
right before the global financial crisis in 2008; the fact that stock prices, which had been on 
an  uptrend,  fell  sharply  in  early  February  by  more  than  the  decline  seen  in a day  at  times 
during the global financial crisis in 2008; and how U.S. long-term interest rates and capital 
flows  to  emerging  and  commodity-exporting  economies  are  affected  by  moves  toward 
normalization of monetary policy in the United States and Europe. Moreover, developments 
in commodity prices -- including crude oil prices, which have continued to increase -- also 
could be risks to the outlook (Chart 2). This is because excessive rises in commodity prices 
could  lead  to  a  rise  in  firms'  expenses  for  materials,  while  sudden  drops  may  bring  about 
market turmoil. 
 B. Current Situation and Outlook of Japan's Economy 
I  will  now  discuss  the  economic  situation  in  Japan.  Japan's  economy  is  expanding 
moderately,  with  a  virtuous  cycle  from  income  to  spending  operating.  Reflecting 
developments in firms' exports and business fixed investment, the real GDP growth rate for 
the  July-September  quarter  of  2017  was  2.5  percent  on  an  annualized  quarter-on-quarter 
basis, representing positive growth for seven consecutive quarters (Chart 3). This is a level 
above Japan's potential growth rate, which is estimated to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent. 
As  the  background  to  these  developments,  we  can  point  to  the  fact  that  real  exports  have 
been on an increasing trend on the back of the growth in overseas economies and business 
fixed  investment  has  continued  on  an increasing  trend  with  corporate  profits  and  business 
sentiment  improving  (Charts  4  and  5).  Owing  to  steady  improvement  in  the  employment 
2 
and income situation, private consumption also has been increasing moderately, albeit with 
fluctuations. According to the Regional Economic Report released by the Bank of Japan in 
January  2018,  out  of  a  total  of  nine  regions  across  Japan,  six  regions,  including  the  Kinki 
region,  reported  that  their  economy  had  been  expanding  or  expanding  moderately.  In 
particular,  the  Kinki  region  --  of  which  Wakayama  Prefecture  is  part  --  revised  up  its 
assessment based on the strengthened momentum in exports and the improvement in private 
consumption,  marking  three  consecutive  quarters  of  upward  revisions  since  July  2017 
(Chart 6).   
 With  Japan's  economic  expansion,  supply-demand  conditions  in  the  labor  market  have 
tightened  steadily.  Firms'  perception  of  labor  shortage  suggested  by  the  diffusion  indexes 
(DIs) for the employment conditions in the December 2017 Tankan (Short-Term Economic 
Survey  of  Enterprises  in  Japan)  has  heightened  in  a  wide  range  of  industries,  and  the 
unemployment  rate  has  been 
in 
the  range  of  2.5-3.0  percent.  The  active 
job 
openings-to-applicants  ratio  is  at  its  highest  level  since  1974,  and  the  ratio  for  full-time 
workers  has  recorded  a  historical  high  (Chart  7).  Against  this  backdrop,  labor-saving 
investment  has  increased in  a  wide  range  of  industries  with  a  view  toward  using  artificial 
intelligence (AI), robotic process automation (RPA), and other means. Some are concerned 
that, if the use of AI and RPA increases, labor positions would be taken over by robots and 
machines,  thereby  easing  labor  market  conditions.  Viewed  from  a  long-term  perspective, 
however,  given  that  Japan's  population  is  expected  to  decline,  the  labor  force,  which  has 
continued to increase, may peak out. Moreover, since firms are likely to be in need of new 
employees  to  provide  new  products  and  services  brought  about  through  innovation  and  to 
make up for a reduction in work hours under working-style reforms, there is a good chance 
that labor market conditions could tighten. 
 With  regard  to  the  outlook,  Japan's  economy  is  likely  to  continue  its  moderate expansion. 
Through fiscal 2018, domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle 
from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household sectors, on 
the  back  of  highly  accommodative  financial  conditions  and  underpinnings  through  the 
government's  past  stimulus  measures.  Business  fixed  investment  is  likely  to  continue 
increasing,  supported  by  firms'  heightened  growth  expectations  and  increases  in  Olympic 
3 
Games-related investment, as well as in labor-saving investment to address labor shortages. 
Private  consumption  is  also  expected  to  follow  a  moderate  increasing  trend  as  the 
employment and income situation continues to improve. Moreover, exports are expected to 
continue their moderate increasing trend on the back of the growth in overseas economies. 
In fiscal 2019, although business fixed investment is likely to decelerate -- mainly reflecting 
cyclical adjustments in capital stock as well as Olympic Games-related demand peaking out 
-- and household spending is likely to decline in the second half of the fiscal year due to the 
effects  of  the  scheduled  consumption  tax  hike,  Japan's  economy  is  expected  to  continue 
expanding, supported in part by the increase in exports led by external demand. According 
to the Bank's January 2018 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (hereafter the Outlook 
Report), the medians  of  the  Policy  Board  members' forecasts  of  the  real  GDP  growth  rate 
are 1.9 percent for fiscal 2017, 1.4 percent for fiscal 2018, and 0.7 percent for fiscal 2019 
(Chart 8). 
 C. Current Situation and Outlook of Prices 
Turning to price developments, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index 
(CPI)  for  all  items  less  fresh  food  is  currently  0.9  percent.  The  rate  has  been  on  an 
improving trend, although gradual, since January 2017, when it started to increase. During 
the 12 months since then, the rate rose by more than 1 percentage point (Chart 9). 
 I believe that there are three factors to consider when projecting the outlook for prices. The 
first is the output gap, which determines future inflation rates. The output gap has widened 
steadily  within  positive  territory  on  the  back  of  the  steady  tightening  of  labor  market 
conditions and a rise in capital utilization rates (Chart 10). In this situation, firms' moves to 
raise  their  employees'  wages  and  prices  have  started  to  be  seen.  Furthermore,  upward 
pressure  on  prices  is  heightening  steadily.  Specifically,  labor  market  conditions  have  been 
tightening further in a wide range of industries  -- as evidenced by the medical and nursing 
service  industry,  for  example,  where  labor  shortage  has  become  more  severe  amid  an 
increase in job openings resulting from large  firms entering the market -- and hourly cash 
earnings of part-time employees in particular have started to increase. Against this backdrop, 
in  the  service  industry,  such  as  dining-out  and  transportation,  some  firms  have  started  to 
4 
raise  prices  since  the  second  half  of  2017  by  passing  a  rise  in  labor  costs  --  arising  from 
labor shortage -- on to prices.   
 The  second  factor  is  medium-  to  long-term  inflation  expectations,  which  are  more  or  less 
unchanged,  after  having  remained  in  a  weakening  phase  since  summer  2015  (Chart  11). 
Going forward, with the improvement in the output gap, firms' stance is likely to gradually 
shift toward raising wages and prices and is expected to push up the observed inflation rate, 
as  I  mentioned  earlier.  In  this  way,  inflation  expectations  are  likely  to  rise  through  the 
adaptive  component,  in  which  expectations  are  formed  in  a  backward-looking  manner.  In 
addition, medium- to long-term inflation expectations are likely to be raised in particular by 
the  forward-looking  component,  which  will  be  in  place,  as  the  Bank  pursues  monetary 
easing through its strong commitment to achieving the price stability target. 
 The  third  factor  is  import  prices.  The  effect  of  a  pick-up  in  crude  oil  prices  since  spring 
2016 is likely to wane moderately, while the yen's depreciation since autumn 2016 is likely 
to increase upward pressure on prices for the time being. 
 In  this  regard,  I  think  it  will  take  some  time  to  achieve  the  price  stability  target,  although 
this seems to be on track so far; favorable conditions for prices to rise at a faster pace going 
forward are beginning to materialize. Therefore, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI 
(all  items  less  fresh  food)  is  projected  to  continue  on  an  uptrend  and  will  likely  reach 
around  2  percent  around  fiscal  2019.  Specifically,  the  medians  of  the  Policy  Board 
members' forecasts of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) 
presented  in  the  January  2018  Outlook  Report  are 0.8  percent  for  fiscal  2017,  1.4  percent 
for fiscal 2018, and, excluding the direct effects of the scheduled consumption tax hike, 1.8 
percent for fiscal 2019 (Chart 8).   
 Nevertheless,  what  warrants  attention  is  developments  in  the  CPI  for  all  items  less  fresh 
food  and  energy,  which  is  essential  to  the  year-on-year  rate  of  increase  in  the  CPI  for  all 
items less fresh food rising further toward the price stability target going forward. With that 
being said, since there may be some time lag until the effects of labor shortages and the hike 
in expenses for materials will be reflected in prices of goods and services provided by firms 
5 
more widely across industries, I will continue to pay close attention to firms' actions toward 
raising prices of goods and services. 
 II. Conduct of Monetary Policy 
A. Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control 
Let me now turn to the Bank's monetary policy. In April 2013, the Bank introduced QQE to 
overcome  deflation  that  had  lasted  for  nearly  15  years.  In  September  2016,  from  the 
viewpoint  of  further  strengthening  the  effects  of  monetary  easing,  it  introduced  a  new 
policy framework of QQE with Yield Curve Control -- consisting of yield curve control, in 
which  the  Bank  controls  short-  and  long-term  interest  rates,  and  an  inflation-overshooting 
commitment. 
 The new policy  framework has two key  features. The first is to  facilitate the formation of 
the yield curve that is considered most appropriate for achieving the price stability target of 
2  percent.  With  yield  curve  control,  the  Bank  seeks  a  decline  in  real  interest  rates  by 
controlling short- and long-term interest rates in a situation where QQE has brought about 
positive effects on economic activity and prices mainly through the decline in real interest 
rates. In theory, the new framework aims to lower the observed real interest rates  -- which 
are obtained by subtracting inflation expectations from the nominal interest rates -- to levels 
below  the  natural  rate  of  interest,  which  is  the  real  interest  rate  at  which  the  economy 
neither  accelerates  nor  decelerates.  The  basic  mechanism  is  that,  when  the  observed  real 
interest  rates  are  lower  than  the  natural  rate  of  interest,  this  stimulates  economic  activity, 
leading  to  acceleration  of  economic  growth;  as  the  output  gap  improves,  upward  pressure 
on prices is generated. 
 Second,  as  another  means  of 
lowering 
the  observed 
real 
interest 
rates, 
the 
inflation-overshooting commitment, under which the Bank works on people's expectations 
to  increase  inflation  expectations,  is  also  important.  The  Bank  aims  to  push  up  inflation 
expectations  and  further  strengthen  the  effects  of  monetary  easing  by  making  a  strong 
commitment  to expanding  the  monetary  base  until  the  year-on-year  rate of  increase  in  the 
observed CPI exceeds 2 percent and stays above that level in a stable manner.

B. Effects of Monetary Easing 
Since the introduction of QQE with Yield Curve Control, the year-on-year rate of change in 
the  CPI  for  all  items  less  fresh  food  --  which  had  declined  to  minus  0.5  percent  in 
September  2016  --  rose  nearly  1.5  percentage  points  to  0.9  percent  in  November  2017. 
Short-  and  long-term  interest  rates  also  have  thus  far  been  maintained  at  levels  consistent 
with the Bank's guideline for market operations. In addition, the sustainability of its policy 
framework  has  increased,  in  that  the  amount  of  the  Bank's  JGB  purchases  varies  flexibly 
according to financial market conditions at the time. With regard to inflation expectations, 
the  results  of  the  72nd  Opinion  Survey  on  the  General  Public's  Views  and  Behavior 
(December  2017  Survey)  released  by  the  Bank  in  January  2018  suggests  that  monetary 
easing  has  started  to  influence  people's  inflation  expectations;  the  proportions  of 
respondents  who  answered  that  prices  would  go  up  one  year  from  now  and  over  the  next 
five years increased compared to the previous survey conducted in September 2017 (Chart 
12). 
 Although the inflation rate has been rising since the introduction of QQE with Yield Curve 
Control,  there  is  still  some  way  to  go  to  achieving  the  price  stability  target.  Let  me  note, 
however, that Japan's economy has been expanding firmly. The conditions  of a further rise 
in  prices  are  also  beginning  to  materialize,  judging  from  (1)  the  rise  in  prices  of  goods 
traded  among  firms,  reflecting  increases  in  commodity  prices  such as  crude oil  prices,  (2) 
the  tightening  of  labor  market conditions, and  (3) the  government's  various  efforts  toward 
improving  firms'  productivity  and  increasing  wages.  Thus,  I  consider  that  the  momentum 
toward achieving the price stability target is maintained. Given this situation, I believe that 
it  is  important  to  persistently  maintain  powerful  monetary  easing  under  QQE  with  Yield 
Curve Control. 
 C. Regarding Future Conduct of Monetary Policy 
Based on the objectives of monetary policy and its effects that I have outlined so far, let me 
now discuss two points regarding the future conduct of such policy that warrant attention. 
 First, while a situation where prices do not rise easily persists, the following achievements 
are  confirmed:  the  real  GDP  growth  rate  registered  positive  growth  for  seven  consecutive 
7 
quarters,  and  the  Financial  Statements  Statistics  of  Corporations  by  Industry  (FSSC) 
released by the Ministry of Finance showed that current profits reached a record high level 
and that internal reserves for  nonfinancial corporations for fiscal 2016 reached a historical 
high  exceeding  406  trillion  yen  (Chart  13).  Nevertheless,  the  ratios  of  investments  and 
personnel expenses to corporate profits have remained low, and I believe that increasing the 
proportion  of  firms'  on-hand  liquidity  to  be  spent  for  future  business  fixed  investment, 
research  and  development,  and  employees'  wages  will  lead  to  a  rise  in  wages  and  prices 
(Chart 14). The same could be said for individuals. Many people have saved money because 
of  anxiety  over  issues  such  as  a  possible  decline  in  the  receipt  of  pension  benefits  and  an 
increasing burden of medical expenses in the future. I also hear that, amid the recent stock 
price hike, gains on stock sales have accumulated as bank deposits. If these funds were used 
for private consumption, owing to an improvement in the employment and income situation, 
corporate profits would be pushed up further and an economic virtuous cycle would operate. 
To  address  this  situation,  on  December  8,  2017,  the  Cabinet  decided  the  New  Economic 
Policy  Package,  which  placed  "Supply  System  Innovation"  and  "Human  Resources 
Development"  as  major  pillars.  The  government  has  laid  out  measures  such  as  providing 
preferential tax treatment for firms that have raised wages. I consider that these measures by 
the  government,  coupled  with  the  Bank's  monetary  easing,  will  play  an  important  role  in 
realizing an economy in which the virtuous cycle operates firmly. 
 Second, as I mentioned earlier, short- and long-term interest rates have been maintained at 
levels consistent with the Bank's guideline for market operations for more than a year since 
the  introduction  of  QQE  with  Yield  Curve  Control  in  September  2016.  However,  looking 
back  at  the  aftermath  of  Black  Monday  in  1987  and  the  global  financial  crisis  in  2008, 
during which I worked as a market practitioner, the market is volatile by nature, much like a 
living  creature;  therefore,  close  attention  should  continue  to  be  paid  to  the  effects  of  the 
current  large-scale  monetary  easing  on  developments  in  economic  activity  and  prices,  as 
well  as  financial  conditions.  In  particular,  I  focus  on  the  effects  imposed  on  (1)  yields  on 
securities  held  by  financial  institutions  and  their  lending  rates,  (2)  developments  in 
corporate  bond  rates  and  flow  of  funds  between  firms  and  investors  based  on  these  rates, 
and (3) investments by insurance companies and pension funds. In a situation where firms 
find it easier to raise funds under a low interest rate environment, financial institutions have 
8 
been taking an active lending stance, and the amount outstanding of bank loans has in fact 
been  increasing  (Chart  15).  Meanwhile,  financial institutions' earnings  have  been  reduced, 
due  in  part to  a  further  decline in  lending  rates  brought  about  by  intensifying  competition 
among banks and to a decline in yields on securities held by financial institutions. At least 
for  now,  I  believe  that  financial  institutions  in  Japan  as  a  whole  have  robust  resilience 
against stress in terms of both capital and liquidity, and stability in the financial system has 
been  maintained.  However,  it  is  necessary  to  carefully  monitor  how  monetary  policy  will 
affect  the  financial  system  and  the  financial  intermediation  function,  including  the 
cumulative  effects  stemming  from  sustaining  the  Bank's  large-scale  monetary  easing. 
Moreover, in facilitating the formation of an appropriate yield curve, the Bank should take 
account  of  economic,  price,  and  financial  conditions,  as  was  indicated  when  QQE  with 
Yield Curve Control was introduced in September 2016. 
 Thank you very much for your attention.
