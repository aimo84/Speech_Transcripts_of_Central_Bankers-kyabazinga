Jean-Pierre Roth: The current economic and monetary policy situation 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the 
Swiss  National  Bank  and  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Bank  for  International 
Settlements, at the Centro di Studi Bancari, Vezia, 17 September 2007. 
The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bankâ€™s website (www.snb.ch). 
 It  is  difficult  to  determine  to  what  extent  the  turmoil  in  the  US  sub-prime  mortgage  market 
impacts  on  the  real  economy.  It  has  hit  Switzerland  at  a  time  when  our  economy  is  in 
enviably good shape. Should the situation in the financial markets not deteriorate any further, 
it is hard to imagine these factors abruptly slowing economic growth. 
With its decision to let the Libor slide back towards 2.75% in the short term, the SNB has 
clearly signalled to the markets an easing of the situation. In Switzerland, price stability has 
been  maintained  for  the  past  13  years,  economic  growth is  significantly  higher  than  in  the 
1990s and our unemployment rate is the lowest of all industrialised countries. It is our goal to 
preserve this favourable situation.
