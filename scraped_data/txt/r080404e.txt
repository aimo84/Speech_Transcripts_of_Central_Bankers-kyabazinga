José De Gregorio: Monetary policy and commodity prices in turbulent 
times 
Keynote address by Mr José De Gregorio, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, at the 2008 
Annual Meeting of Latin American Chief Executives of the Institute of International Finance 
(IIF), hosted by Corpbanca, Santiago, 2 April 2008. 
I am very grateful to Igal Magendzo for his great contribution during the preparation of these notes. 
 The global economy is in turmoil. In this scenario, monetary policies around the world face 
strong challenges. Sailing through quiet waters has been pleasant. As we know, the stable 
and prosperous performance of the world economy in recent years has partly been the result 
of sound monetary policies. Now, during difficult times, monetary policy should contribute to 
make  the  adjustment  less  costly  and  lay  the  foundations  for  a  sound,  persistent  recovery. 
Macroeconomic management in emerging market economies have improved significantly in 
the past several years, owing part of this to the large increase in commodity prices, but also 
to fiscal consolidation and the commitment to price stability. This has increased the resilience 
of emerging economies to global economic turbulences. 
In this presentation I will address three issues. First, the troublesome inflationary effects of 
the  high  commodity  prices  cycle  we  have  experienced.  Then,  I  will  argue  that,  in  this 
juncture,  reinforcing  the  commitment  to  control  inflation  and  reverse  deviations  from  the 
target is a first order task. Finally, drawing upon lessons from the recent experience I will talk 
about  risk  management  in  monetary  policy,  and  what  it  implies  in  such  an  uncertain 
economic environment as we face today. 
Commodity prices and domestic adjustment 
Recent  increases  in  the  prices  of  commodities  have  been  dramatic:  many  reached  record 
highs  in  a  very  short  period  of  time.  This  increase  has  been  particularly  broad  across 
commodities and unexpectedly persistent.

 We are in the presence of a significant relative price shock. The relative price of foodstuff 
and  energy  has  changed  in  a  number  of  countries.  Given  the  persistency  of  these 
international  relative  prices  changes,  domestic  prices  are  adjusting  accordingly,  giving  the 
appropriate signals for resource reallocation. Chile is an interesting case in this respect.

 The impressive scale of the supply shocks and their transmission to Chilean domestic prices 
can  be  appreciated  by  comparing  the  unusual  increase  of  some  prices  in  2007  with  their 
average increase since the year 2000. Non-perishable foods rose by nearly 15% last year, 
while only around 2% per year in 2000-2006. The prices of fresh fruit and vegetables – even 
considering high-price years like 2002 and 2005 – fell by an average of nearly 2% between 
2000 and 2006, while in 2007 they increased by more than 30%. During last year, the price 
of gasoline unexpectedly increased by almost 15%. 
One characteristic of the Chilean economy is that changes in costs are regularly passed on 
to consumer prices. Markets for foodstuff are globally integrated and competitive. In the case 
of  fuels,  every  week  the  changes  in  the  international  price  are  passed  on  to  domestic 
consumers. However, there is a price stabilization fund to smooth out short run fluctuations 
BIS Review 39/2008

and  recently  there  has  been  a  gasoline  tax  cut,  which  ameliorates  the  large  increase  in 
international prices. Finally, the electric power price-setting mechanism is designed to pass 
changes in upstream marginal costs to retail prices. Electric power rates, affected by a rise in 
costs,  posted  an  average  increase  of  23%  during  2007  compared  with  a  less  than  6% 
average increase between 2000 and 2006. 
This context of price flexibility provides the right signals to markets. In the case of Chile, with 
the increase in the prices of electricity and minerals, several investment projects are in the 
pipeline, which will propel an expansion of supply.

that all income above certain long-term price has to be saved. Government surplus has been

The  downside  of  commodity  price  increases  is  inflation.  The  rise  in  the  prices  of  specific 
goods leads to an increase in measured inflation. The effects of these external shocks on 
inflation will depend on a number of factors. First, on the weight each commodity has in total 
CPI.  In  general,  in  poorer  countries  commodities  in  general  (foodstuff  and  energy  in 
particular)  have  more  weight,  while  in  richer  countries,  services  are  more  important.  Also 
important is the level of price protection (tariffs, price bands and other mechanisms to isolate 
internal prices from international fluctuations), price controls or subsidies. In Chile, the shock 
to food prices has been further aggravated by weather problems.

During 2007, inflation in Chile rose to numbers way above the inflation target of 3% and the 
tolerance ceiling of 4%, largely due to the commodity price hikes. Measured in US dollars, 
Chile is one of the countries where foodstuff increased the most. Nevertheless, about 30% of 
the price rise obeyed to country-specific climatic factors that translated into a dramatic fall in 
crop yields. In addition, the oil price increase, from US$70 to US$110 and beyond, affected 
not  only  the  prices  of  gasoline  and  diesel,  but  also  power  rates.  Again,  an  idiosyncratic 
problem compounded with the international shock. In Chile, 50% of electricity is generated in 
hydroelectric plants. Given the low rainfall of 2007, it was necessary to intensify diesel-based 
generation,  which  significantly  raised  marginal  upstream  costs  and  ultimately  consumers’ 
electric bill (households, industrial producers, etc.).

The upward trend of international prices of foodstuff has not replicated the intensity of 2007 
and the weather-related problems of last year were left behind with the change of season. 
Nevertheless, Chile faces this year a new climatic shock that is already affecting the prices of 
perishable goods and electricity, associated to the “La Niña” phenomenon. 
The  challenge  of  monetary  policy  is  to  allow  the  adjustment  in  relative  prices  avoiding 
undesired second-round effects. For this purpose, we have adopted a flexible inflation target 
framework.  The  inflation  objective  is  to  keep  inflation  most  of  the  time  close  to  3%  with  a 
tolerance range of plus/minus one percentage point. We implement this framework adapting 
monetary policy to having an inflation forecast near 3% in about two years. This time horizon 
gives enough flexibility to allow for the full effects of monetary policy to take place and for 
transitory  inflationary  shock  to  vanish  without  the  need  for  monetary  policy  action.  It  also 
incorporates the output costs of disinflation. 
On the need to reinforce the commitment with price stability 
Both theory and empirical evidence indicate that inflation damages economic growth. As a 
result, the best contribution that monetary policy can make to a country’s long-term growth is 
to  keep  inflation  low  and  stable.  Price  stability  reduces  uncertainty  and  generates  an 
environment  that  promotes  investment,  productivity  growth,  and  financial  development. 
Likewise,  these  factors  stimulate  growth  and  favor  risk  diversification.  Moreover,  price

stability  prevents  the  arbitrary  and  often  regressive  redistribution  of  resources  between 
debtors and creditors, and between the owners of labor and capital. It also limits the Central 
Bank’s collection of a disruptive and regressive tax: inflation. In short, low and stable inflation 
improves welfare of the overall population. Although many other policies are also essential to 
a  solid  economic  performance,  a  low-inflation  environment  is  a  necessary  and  essential 
condition for maximizing the contribution of other public policies.  
To  reduce  inflation,  most  central  banks  raise  short-term  interest  rates  affecting  the  whole 
yield curve. This depresses aggregate demand for GDP and appreciates the local currency, 
reducing  inflationary  pressures.  Inflation  reduction  is  costly.  There  are  those  who  ask  to 
reduce inflation, depreciate the currency and grow more, all at the same time. This cannot be 
achieved  solely  with  one  instrument.  There  are  short-term  tradeoffs.  The  more  persistent 
these tradeoffs, the costlier to bring inflation back under control. Expectations play a crucial 
role.  If  agents  expect  inflation  to  go  down  towards  a  target,  they  will  price  their  goods 
accordingly and inflation persistence will be lower. If, in contrast, agents expect inflation to 
persist in high levels, they will price goods higher, making inflation more persistent and more 
difficult for the central bank to bring it down. As stated in Bernanke (2007): “a one-off change 
in  energy  prices  can  translate  into  persistent  inflation  only  if  it  leads  to  higher  expected 
inflation and a consequent “wage-price spiral”. With inflation expectations well anchored, a 
one-time increase in energy prices should not lead to a permanent increase in inflation, but 
only to a change in relative prices.” Credibility of the target in an inflation-targeting regime is 
therefore a key asset. 
If we were to give up on the inflation commitment, the future adjustment of interest rates to 
rein  in  inflation  would  have  to  be  much  larger,  with  adverse  consequences  on  economic 
activity and relative prices, in particular the exchange rate. Indeed, we have witnessed many 
experiences where a persistent rise in inflation has required strong monetary policy actions, 
the most notable case being the great inflation of the USA in the 1970s and early 80s. The 
control of inflation in Chile has also come with a decline in inflationary persistence. 
Therefore,  a  credible  commitment  to  price  stability  brings  along  output  stability.  Output 
stability, in turn, is an important factor to foster economic growth and the consequent social 
progress that comes with it (Ramey and Ramey, 1995, and Fatas, 2002). This is also what 
has happened with the well known Great Moderation experienced in industrialized countries, 
where  a  credible  monetary  policy  framework  committed  to  stabilize  inflation  is  one  of  the 
explanatory factors (Galí and Gambetti, 2007). 
As  a  consequence  of  the  above,  a  central  issue  for  inflation  targeters  is  finding  reliable 
measures  of  inflation  expectations.  The  most  common  practice  is  to  rely  on  surveys  to 
specialists  and  on  financial  prices.  Both  have  problems.  Surveys  not  always  are  good 
measure  of  market  expectations,  especially  for  longer  terms  which  are  those  that  most 
interest central banks. For example, in the case of Chile, the expected inflation 24 months 
ahead reported by market analysts in the monthly survey conducted by the Central Bank has 
very  little  variation,  which  is  hard  to  believe  given  the  magnitude  of  shocks.  On  the  other 
hand, inflation compensations derived from financial market prices have premiums that are 
hard to measure and most likely time varying. In fact, inflation compensation measures have 
recently  shown  increases.  This  has  been  observed  also  in  several  other  countries.  We 
believe  this  to  be  driven,  to  a  large  extent,  by  changes  in  different  risk  premiums  in  the 
context  of  high  uncertainty,  liquidity  problems  and  portfolio  adjustments.  Indeed,  the 
inflationary  compensation  from  year  5  to  year  10  has  increased  together  with  the  forecast 
error of inflation. In light of the flaws presented by the indicators, the best strategy today is to 
consider a broad set of indicators. For the future, it becomes an important task to encourage 
research to improve our understanding of measures of expectations.

 Macroeconomic risk management 
The main risk stemming from the world economy is the deceleration of the US economy. We 
still do not know, and there are unusually big uncertainties, about the depth and duration of 
the  US  slowdown.  However,  this  slowdown  should  not  be  a  surprise,  and  is  an  expected 
consequence  of  a  correction  in  US  current  account  imbalances.  The  adjustment  to  those 
imbalances,  sooner  or  later  had  to  result  in  economic  slowdown  and  a  correction  of 
exchange rates (see, e.g., De Gregorio, 2007, and Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2007). Indeed, as I 
argued  some  time  ago,  a  current  account  reversal  should  occur  sooner  or  later  and  a 
depreciation of the dollar should help. The Central Bank of Chile included among the risks 
described  in  the  Inflation  Report,  the  correction  of  global  imbalances  since  January  2004. 
The adjustment was triggered and seriously aggravated by the subprime crisis. 
Usually central banks define a baseline scenario to orient monetary policy. We make public 
this scenario in three Monetary Policy Reports that are presented to the Senate. Deviations 
from  the  baseline  scenario  result  in  adjustments  of  the  path  of  monetary  policy.  Risk 
management  becomes  central  when  deviations  are  not  small,  and  the  probability  of 
occurrence  of  large  and  disruptive  deviations  becomes  significant.  In  that  case,  strong 
actions may be needed, which may result in large deviations from the policies envisioned in 
the base projection. 
In  this  context,  we  can  interpret  current  policy  actions  in  the  US  as  exactly  doing  risk 
management.  As  explained  in  Mishkin  (2008):  “given  that  financial  market  disruption  can 
pose  significant  risks  to  the  macroeconomy,  risk  management  is  crucial  in  formulating  the 
appropriate response of monetary policy… the design of monetary policy ought to reflect the 
public’s  preferences,  especially  with  respect  to  avoiding  particularly  adverse  economic 
outcomes.” Furthermore, he adds that “the most likely outcome – referred to as the modal 
forecast – for the economy may be fairly benign, but there may be a significant risk of more 
severe adverse outcomes. In such circumstances, the central bank may prefer to take out 
insurance.” In other words, the Fed is preventing large and disruptive consequences of the 
current credit crisis in the economy. 
In  emerging  market  economies  the  main  risk  is  inflation,  that  is,  the  propagation  of 
inflationary shocks to high and persistent inflation. Indeed, past experience shows that when 
10 
 BIS Review 39/20086
inflation goes up there is an increase in indexation practices, which make inflationary shocks 
more persistent or more difficult to fight. In addition, the persistence of relatively high inflation 
is  likely  to  diminish  the  degree  to  which  expectations  are  anchored.  On  the  one  hand, 
inflation  expectations  may  increase,  making  it  costlier  to  bring  it  back  down.  On  the  other 
hand,  medium  and  long  term  inflation  expectations  are  likely  to  become  more  sensitive  to 
shocks,  introducing  undesired  volatility  to  the  economy  with  the  associated  costs  of  said 
volatility. All this can derive on an inflation spiral, fueled by higher prices, higher indexation 
practices, accelerating wages and increases in inflation expectations. These processes can 
be very persistent and extremely costly to the economy. In some cases they may even result 
in sudden uncontrolled inflation acceleration with catastrophic consequences. Nevertheless 
we  have  learnt  the  lesson,  and  we  know  today  the  importance  of  price  stability  and 
appropriate risk management.
