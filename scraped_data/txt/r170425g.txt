CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY 
   
 
20 April 2017 
 Thank you for inviting me to speak. 
Today, I will focus on a long-term view of the Danish economy. My key messages are: 
1.  As a result of a long history of reform-oriented policies, the Danish economy today stands 
strong with no major imbalances. 
2.  The fixed exchange rate regime has been a cornerstone in the Danish economy for more 
than 30 years – and this has not changed with negative interest rates. 
3.  The strategy for issuance of Danish government bonds is focused on supporting liquidity. 
Issuance is concentrated in 2- and 10-year nominal bonds. 
 35 years ago the Danish economy was in a miserable state. There were huge imbalances illus-
trated by a deficit of the public finances of almost 10 per cent of GDP and a long term interest 
rate of more than 20 per cent. This was partly a consequence of the shocks to the global econ-
omy in the 1970s but also a result of an inappropriate economic policy. The path to a turna-
round began with the introduction of the fixed-exchange-rate policy in 1982.  
It was followed by a long period of major reforms of the economy – of the labour market, the 
tax system, and the pension system. The result has been that Denmark today stands as one of 
the few economies in the world with an AAA rating with stable outlook.     
Of the reforms implemented over the period, I will highlight one: The reform of the pension sys-
tem in 2006. Here the public pension age was indexed to life expectancy. Together with the 
longstanding tradition of funded labour market pensions, this is the main reason behind the as-
sessment that public finances are sustainable in the long run. We do not have huge unfinanced 
pension obligations waiting to be unleashed in the future as is the case in many other countries.   
The reforms of the labour market have reduced the level of structural unemployment to close to 
4 per cent of the labour force. 
Page 1 of 8 
  The Danish labour market is flexible with few restrictions on hiring and firing but with an ex-
tended social safety net. In my mind there is no doubt that this is a major reason for the relative 
positive attitude vis-á-vis globalisation among the majority of the Danish population.  
The turnaround of the Danish economy can also be illustrated by the development in the current 
account and the Danish net foreign asset position. 
At present, the current account surplus is almost 8 per cent of GDP – the highest level in the 
post-war era. Denmark has consistently run a balance of payments surplus since 1990. 
The balance of payments surpluses have turned a net foreign debt of close to 40 per cent of 
GDP in the beginning of the 1990s into an even larger net claim.  
In recent years there has been a substantial return on net foreign assets of 3-4 per cent of GDP. 
This explains a part of the large surplus on the current account. Another part is due to the build-
up of pension funds. The ageing of the population will eventually reduce the surplus on the cur-
rent account and perhaps turn it into a deficit.  
Let me stress that the surplus on the current account is the aggregated result of households' 
and firms' individual decisions. It is not a public priority to have as high a surplus as possible.      
Although the Danish economy today is sound there have been bumps on the road… 
The Danish economy boomed in the mid-2000s and ended up over-heated with big imbalances 
in terms of a housing bubble, loss of competitiveness, and high household indebtedness. The 
economy was particularly hard hit by the financial crisis almost ten years ago, and it has taken a 
long time to recover.  
Since 2012 the economy has been in an upswing with growth in employment and a closing out-
put gap. We expect this to continue in the coming years with growth in real GDP of around 1.6 
per cent per year.  
There are currently no major imbalances in the economy that call for immediate political action. 
Danish firms today are very competitive. Public finances are healthy and sustainable in the long 
run. Inflation has been low for a period due to the fall in oil prices in late 2015 but is now fore-
casted to just below 2 per cent in 2018. The only major ”imbalance” is a surplus on the current 
account of 8 per cent of GDP, and it is not really an imbalance but reflects to a certain extent 
demographic induced structural savings surplus, as previously mentioned.       
There are challenges, however…  
One is to ensure sufficient labour supply to cover the increasing demand for labour. Employ-
ment is close to its structural level and in the coming years it will be a bit above as seen in the 
chart. Unemployment is also close to its cyclically neutral level. Thus, there are very few available 
resources on the labour market. 
Page 2 of 8 
  In our central forecast scenario, the increased demand for labour will be covered by increased 
labour supply.   
Major reforms of the labour market have been implemented over the past two decades. This has 
raised the structural level of employment.  
The pension reforms have increased markedly the participation rates among senior groups on 
the labour market and will continue to do so in the coming years as the reforms are phased-in. 
This counteracts a structural decline of the number of persons in the working ages due to aging 
of the population.  
Part of the increase in the supply of labour will probably come from abroad, e.g. Eastern Eu-
rope. This will help to avoid a shortage of labour in the years to come. 
So far, the tight labour market has not resulted in accelerating wages. Over the last couple of 
years, the rate of increase has, however, been higher than abroad. And we expect this to con-
tinue in the years to come.   
In a fixed-exchange-rate regime as the Danish one, wages function as a buffer capturing shocks 
to the economy instead of the exchange rate. A flexible labour market and flexible wage for-
mation are therefore essential. There is still room for higher wage growth and employment in 
the Danish economy – but it should happen in an orderly way avoiding excesses. 
Another part of the economy which warrants vigilance is the housing market. 
Prices on single-family houses have been rising the past four years in large parts of the country. 
That is a good thing. This has fuelled demand and thereby underpinned the growth in the econ-
omy.  
Real house prices are still well below the level during the over-heating of the housing market in 
the mid-2000, and we forecast a soft landing for the housing market.   
The rate of growth in house prices for the market on average has levelled off over the past half 
year and is now below 4 per cent on a yearly basis in nominal terms. For the market for owner-
occupied flats in the Copenhagen area, the story is different… 
Here, prices have been rising by around 10 per cent per year for several years.  In the most re-
cent quarters, the price increase has levelled off somewhat – but the rate of increase is still 8 per 
cent per year in nominal terms.   
The price level for owner-occupied flats in Copenhagen is high relative to incomes and interest 
rates. At the same time, interest-rate sensitivity is higher in Copenhagen than the average for 
Denmark overall. This makes the Copenhagen housing market vulnerable to interest-rate hikes. 
Thus, there is a considerable risk that if the real price increases seen in recent years continue, 
they will be followed by corresponding falls.  
Page 3 of 8 
  Let me underline, we are not yet in a housing bubble, but the situation warrants attention.  
Part of the problem is that the present regime of housing taxation is destabilising. To counter 
this, a number of macro-prudential measures have been taken. Among these is a requirement of 
a higher down payment if one wants to buy a house or apartment in Copenhagen and a number 
of other cities, just as the requirements of the financial robustness of the buyer has been tight-
ened. 
The monetary policy rate is directed solely at the fixed-exchange-rate policy and thus is not 
available to counter pressures on the housing market.  
The situation in the mid-2000s is in fresh memory but we do not see a similar situation develop 
in near future. It is a risk factor, however. 
Let me now turn to monetary policy and our experiences with negative interest rates. 
For a long time, Danish monetary policy has been focused on maintaining a fixed exchange rate 
against the euro. In fact, Danmarks Nationalbank has conducted a fixed-exchange-rate policy for 
more than three decades – first against the D-Mark and from 1999 against the euro. We recently 
celebrated the 30 years anniversary of the central rate. 
The legal framework is the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Officially, the krone may fluctu-
ate by up to 2.25 per cent on either side of the central rate, but in practice Danmarks National-
bank ensures that the fluctuations are far smaller. This reflects that Danmarks Nationalbank 
takes consistent action as the krone exchange rate starts drifting away from the central rate. 
The exchange rate peg is a cornerstone of Danish economic policy. It is a political decision. This 
means that there is a clear mandate, and the policy enjoys support from across the political 
spectrum. It is a fundamental part of the overall framework for economic policy. 
The policy framework implies that interest rates are reserved for keeping the krone stable. Mon-
etary policy does not take factors such as growth, employment and house prices into account. 
These considerations are – or should be – addressed by other economic policies. In particular, 
fiscal policy potentially plays an important role in ironing out economic fluctuations. 
As a result of the policy regime, Danish monetary policy interest rates tend to track euro area 
interest rates set by the European Central Bank, the ECB, very closely. This means that to the 
extent that the Danish business cycle is synchronised with that of the euro area, our monetary 
policy will tend to limit economic fluctuations. 
Overall, the policy framework has delivered strong results. Compared to most other countries, 
we have enjoyed a stable macroeconomic environment.  
The long history of the exchange rate peg means that all agents in the economy make decisions 
based on its existence: 
Page 4 of 8 
    Firms and households set wages knowing that a loss in competitiveness will not be offset by 
a depreciation of the exchange rate. This has ensured price and wage stability – and firmly 
anchored inflation expectations. 
  Banks implicitly support the peg by engaging in what you could call ”stabilising speculation”: 
They take positions, if the exchange rate starts to fluctuate. This illustrates the credibility of 
the peg in financial markets. 
  The government also knows that monetary policy will not ”correct the mistakes” made by 
fiscal policy. Also, as an overly expansionary fiscal policy may reduce the credibility of the 
fixed exchange rate. This – to some extent – disciplines fiscal policy. The tendency to fiscal 
pro-cyclicality during the strong economic expansion in the mid-2000s might well have been 
worse under a different monetary regime. 
 
To summarize, the peg to the D-mark/euro has served Denmark well for more than three dec-
ades. 
From time to time the framework is, however, put to a test by strong capital in- or outflows. One 
such test occurred in January and February 2015 when Denmark experienced a very large inflow 
of capital. The inflow started as the Swiss National Bank announced on 15 January that they 
would no longer prevent the Swiss Franc from appreciating against the euro. 
To prevent the krone from appreciating, Danmarks Nationalbank responded by intervening in 
the FX market followed by interest rate reductions.  
With effect from 6 February, the rate on certificates of deposits was reduced to -0.75 per cent. 
This was a level that had not been seen previously. As the inflow of capital started, its width and 
depth was not known. This induced us to reduce rates gradually. 
Danmarks Nationalbank's monetary policy interest rates were transmitted to money-market in-
terest rates. Control of the difference between money-market rates in the euro area and Den-
mark – the interest-rate spread – is crucial for controlling the exchange rate. And the experience 
clearly showed that the interest rate spread is also effective during episodes of negative interest 
rates and appreciation pressure on the krone. 
These conventional measures were supplemented by extraordinary measures such as the tem-
porary suspension of the issuance of government bonds. 
Compared with previous episodes of pressure against the krone, our interventions in the FX 
market were larger in 2015. This reflects the size of the capital flows. But it also makes an im-
portant difference whether there is upward or downward pressure on the krone. 
In periods with upward pressure, Danmarks Nationalbank sells kroner. As we can always issue 
kroner, this implies that there is no limit to how much we can intervene in the FX market. On the 
other hand, there is a limit to how much interest rates can be reduced – although there are no 
indications that we have been close to that limit.  
Page 5 of 8 
  Later in 2015 – when the pressure had abated – we again intervened in the FX market. But this 
time by purchasing kroner thereby bringing FX reserves back down.  
As I will return to in a minute, the substantially negative official interest rates have implied that 
large bank deposits by firms and institutional investors also receive negative interest rates. 
Households, on the other hand, have not been exposed to negative interest rates.  
In principle, negative interest rates can be circumvented by holding cash, which always offers a 
nominal return of zero. But we have not experienced an unusual increase in the demand for 
cash. This reflects the substantial costs of secure storage and transport of large amounts of 
cash. Furthermore, it is cumbersome and expensive to use cash for transactions involving large 
amounts or large geographical distances. And almost ¾ of all cash outside the MFI sector is 
held by households – a sector that has not been exposed to negative interest rates. 
Increased household demand for cash would primarily be a problem of social efficiency relating 
to the trouble of settling transactions in cash. The impact on our policy target – the exchange 
rate – is likely to be modest. More importantly, the transmission to the exchange rate would 
weaken if banks were to choose to settle accounts in cash, thereby deactivating money market 
rates. Or if institutional investors were to hold cash rather than earning negative deposit rates. 
Assessing how far into negative territory interest rates can go before the various actors switch 
from deposits to cash on a major scale is difficult. Currently, there are no indications that nega-
tive interest rates lead to a surge in the demand for cash. This indicates that the lower bound on 
monetary policy rates in Denmark well is below the current level of the rate of interest on certifi-
cates of deposit of -0.65 per cent. 
It is also relevant to point out that Denmark is not a very cash-based economy and that the 
share of cash transactions has been declining.  
As mentioned before, households have so far been shielded from negative rates. Negative in-
terest rates on deposit are, however, in wide-spread use for corporates and investment and 
pension funds. The increased spread between household deposit rates and other sectors might 
be due to sectoral differences in alternatives to deposits. 
For households, the alternative to deposits might be cash with a zero interest rate, but incurring 
the inconveniences of cash. On the other hand, for large corporates, investment and pension 
funds the alternative might be placement on money market-like terms. 
Banks are continuously adjusting their business models. Declining margins have – on average – 
lowered banks net interest income. Interest income now constitutes less than half of their total 
income.  
Banks are compensating for the falling net interest income by expanding new business areas 
such as wealth management and adjusting their fees. 
Page 6 of 8 
  Thus, to the worried banker, I can say that the fear of falling income in a world with negative in-
terest rates have not materialized in Denmark. But he needs to keep his eyes on the road and 
continuously make the needed adjustments. 
As described in the previous slides, the Danish economy is in good condition and holds the 
highest possible credit rating with all major rating agencies.  
One reason is the low level of debt. Central-government debt is currently 23 per cent of GDP, and 
the EMU debt is among the lowest in Europe. 
As you may know, issuance of central government debt is conducted by Danmarks Nationalbank 
on behalf of the Danish government. The agreed framework includes two very central funding 
rules that support the separation of fiscal and monetary policy: The domestic and the foreign 
funding rule.  
Under the domestic funding rule, the central government borrows in kroner to cover its current 
budget deficit and redemptions on the domestic debt.  
The krone-denominated bonds and bills are held by a broad investor base – including both Dan-
ish and non-resident investors. The Danish insurance and pension sector is the biggest investor 
segment with holdings of around 50 per cent of the bonds, while non-resident investors hold 
approximately 40 per cent. Some of them are US dollar-based investors like you. 
Foreign funding, on the other hand, is only used to maintain an adequate foreign-exchange re-
serve.  
This means that, as a general rule, the central government raises loans in foreign currency if it is 
deemed appropriate to support the foreign-exchange reserve. This has not been the case in re-
cent years, and the loans have been gradually repaid.  
Therefore, since the repayment of a dollar-loan in March 2017 the Danish central government 
currently has no foreign currency loans. 
In 2017, the target for domestic bond issuance is 65 billion kroner – or around 9 billion euro. 
This is unchanged from 2016. Issuance will mainly be focussed in the 2- and 10-year segments to 
build up of the volume of two new on-the-run issues and to support market liquidity.  
In addition to focussing issuance, several other recent measures support liquidity in the gov-
ernment bond market. This includes the introduction of regular switch operations – allowing 
primary dealers and investors to switch off-the-run issues to more liquid on-the run issues with-
out major transaction costs. Switch operations are conducted bi-weekly, supporting the primary 
dealers’ opportunities to supply liquidity in the secondary market. 
In addition, the central government also supports the market via tap sales and buy-backs direct-
ly in secondary markets. This gives the primary dealers an extra opportunity to buy and sell se-
Page 7 of 8 
  curities in smaller volumes outside the auctions, further reducing the risk of trading in Danish 
government bonds. 
Most recently, as of 1 April, a new primary-dealer model was introduced. In the new model, re-
quirements have been tightened so that each primary dealer to a larger extent is measured rela-
tive to the best price quoters. At the same time, the best price quoters are rewarded, which 
provides a stronger incentive to quote the sharpest possible prices – hopefully to the benefit of 
you and the rest of the market.  
The very preliminary experience has been increased secondary market turnover and tighter 
price quotations.  
A new 10-year bond was opened successfully in January and a new bond maturing in 2020 is ex-
pected to be issued later this year. Despite focussing on those segments in 2017, the central 
government maintains a broad list of on-the-run bonds. This includes 5- and 20-year bonds and 
an inflation-linked bond.  
So, for those of you looking for high quality bonds with good liquidity, there should be plenty of 
options available in Danish government bonds. 
Thank you for your attention.
