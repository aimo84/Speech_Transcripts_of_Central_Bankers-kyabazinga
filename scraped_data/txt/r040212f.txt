Shkëlqim Cani: The monetary programme of 2004 - its cohabitation with the 
fiscal policy 
Discussion by Mr Shkëlqim Cani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, in the Parliamentary Commission 
of Economy, Finance and Privatizations, Tirana, 15 December 2003.  
 2003 in figures 
1. 
The  Albanian  economy  during  2003  seems  to  have  returned  to  its  potential  growth  rates,  leaving 
behind  the  deceleration  of  2002.  Various  indicators  generally  point  out  that  the  economic  growth 
forecast for 2003 - of about 6 percent - is a real opportunity. Developments such as: stability in the 
agricultural production, the positive performance in the branches of services, industry and transport, 
the  increase  of  the  trade  transactions  volume  verified  in  the  first  6  months  of  the  year,  the  greater 
number  of  tourists,  the  stable  and  favourable  energy  situation,  stability  of  remittances  and  other 
factors, are reliable arguments in achieving the economy growth objective. 
2003  is  believed  to  mark  another  year  of  the  consumption  price  stability.  As  in  the  3-4  previous 
months,  the  Bank  of  Albania’s  expectations  speak  about  an  annual  inflation  rate  within  the 
target  interval  of  2-4  percent.  According  to  the  latest  data,  the  12-month  difference  of 
consumption price index by the end of November 2003, marked the figure of 3.4 percent, while 
the  annual  inflation,  calculated  as  the  average  of  the  last  twelve  months,  reached  the  level  of 
2.24 percent, reinforcing thus its clear downward trend.  
The Bank of Albania - in its recent analyses - has been underlining the fact that its monetary policy has 
been  a  careful,  financial,  budgetary  policy,  where  special  emphasis  has  been  given  to  the  budget 
expenditures  control  versus  the  realized  revenues  ratio.  Consequently,  the  government’s  liquidity 
needs,  up  to  the  present  moment,  have  been  completely  covered  by  the  banking  system,  and 
therefore,  the  Bank  of  Albania  financing  was  unnecessary.  Under  these  circumstances  the  fiscal 
pressures on the monetary policy are weak. Following this reasoning, it could be concluded that the 
move of both policies (monetary and fiscal) has been in harmony and in conformity with the general 
economic-financial development program of the country. 
Domestic  budget  deficit  financing  from  the  banking  system  during  2003  is  estimated  to  be 
almost at the same level as the one of 2002, being about 2.2 percent of the GDP. The stable level 
of the internal government borrowing, facing the rapid increase of Lek deposits, was another factor, 
which influenced the immediate reduction of treasury bills interest rates.  
The monetary policy of 2003 has continued to be careful, characterized by smoothing tendencies. This 
is reflected in the reduction of interest rates three times throughout the year. Watching attentively the 
inflation performance and the liquidity indicators in the banking system, the Bank of Albania reduced, 
all in all, the Repos rate by 1.5 percentage points during 2003, bring it by the end of October at the 
pre-crisis liquidity level of the previous year.  
The real interest rates in positive terms have not changed the attitude of households and agencies in 
depositing  their  savings  in  the  banking  system.  This  helped  keeping  up  the  liquidity  ratios  in  the 
system.  Monetary  developments  show  that  the  deposits  hemorrhage  of  spring  2002  has  been 
completely overcome, which is reflected in a liquidity surplus of the banking system, fluctuating round 
the level of Lek 5.3 billion during 2003. Worth underlining is the fact that, the surplus liquidity brought 
about  the  reduction  of  financial  intermediation  costs,  expressed  in  the  reduction  of  the  difference 
between the treasury bills and Lek deposits interest rates. 
Also,  considering  the  appreciating  tendencies  of  Lek  during  2003,  the  Bank  of  Albania  has 
been  present  in  the  foreign  exchange  market.  The  foreign  exchange  activity  of  the  Bank  of 
Albania resulted in the injection of Lek 3.9 liquidity billion, in the market. However, considering 
the  surplus  liquidity  performance  in  banks,  the  Bank  of  Albania  sterilized  the  foreign  exchange 
purchasing  effect.  It  performed  outright  selling  of  treasury  bills  from  its  portfolio,  at  a  value  of  Lek 
4.07 billion.  The  rest  of  the  surplus  liquidity  was  withdrawn  through  the  repurchase  agreements.  In 
support  of  the  economy  growth,  this  year  seems  to  have  marked  a  greater  support  towards  the 
economy  crediting.  Banks’ credit portfolio for the private sector of the economy increased by 
Lek 10.1 billion during the first 10 months of the year. During this period, a new credit of Lek

70.6 billion (USD 660 million) was extended to the economy, or 45 percent more than the same 
period in the previous year. 
Based on the developments noticed during the first ten months, on the current developments of the 
banking system liquidity, etc., it could be summarized that monetary developments of 2003 will be a 
greater contribution to the consolidation of the overall macroeconomic equilibrium of the country. In 
order to have a clearer view of the expected economic situation by end of 2003, following is given a 
table  showing  the  general  indicators  of  the  country’s  economic  development,  including  here  the 
monetary ones as well.

 As a conclusion, I would like to underline once again that the Bank of Albania does not make its policy 
decisions separately,  but  following  carefully  all  the developments  of  the  economy,  and  this  is  really 
important  for  the  public  to  understand.  As  it  is  now  a  tradition,  the  monetary  policy  of  the  Bank  of 
Albania is part of the general economic development program of the country. As such, it can’t be but a 
range of decisions and measures, which in good harmony with the other policies, the fiscal one, etc., 
2 
 BIS Review 8/2004
aim at economy growth and reduction of the poverty in the country. The coordination of monetary and 
fiscal  policies  could  be  achieved  in  the  mid-term  development  program  of  the  country,  a  program 
covering  a  three-year  time  span.  The  extensive  logic  of  this  program  gives  a  crucial  importance  to 
keeping  up  macroeconomic  stability.  Keeping  up  macroeconomic  stability  serves  as  a  bridging  gap 
between the monetary policy and the fiscal one. Hence, the monetary policy is committed in keeping 
up price stability, whereas the fiscal one controls the budget deficit. These macroeconomic indicators 
are  strongly  related  to  one  another:  fulfilling  each  of  them  requires,  as  a  basic  condition,  the 
observance of the other objectives. Following this idea and backing it up in figures, please allow me to 
shortly through a glance back in the past. 
The soundness of the Albanian state in these last years, the economic growth and amelioration of the 
tax and customs entities performance, enabled the reduction of the budget deficit. This deficit fell from 
11.4 percent of the GDP in 1998 to 6.9 percent in 2002. In 2003, it is expected to fall at the level of 
5.8 percent of the GDP, whereas the draft-budget for 2004 has an even more ambitious objective: the 
reduction of the general budget deficit at the level of 4.8 percent of the GDP. This fiscal discipline has 
given  its  own  results.  It  influenced  the  reduction  of  treasury  bills  interest  rates,  bringing  about  an 
overall reduction of interest rates in economy. The reduction of interest rates and the government’s 
demand for funds gave a greater respiration to economy crediting. It has extended more funds - at 
lower interest rates - to be used by the public sector. According to the data provided by the Bank of 
Albania, economy crediting increased at an average of 90 percent per year during 1999-2002. On the 
other  side,  the  reduction  of  the  Bank  of  Albania’s  financing  to  state  budget,  gave  positive 
impacts on the liquidity indicators in the system. Now the long-term monetary assets gave a 
straightforward contribution on keeping inflation at low levels. Inflation fell from 8.7 percent in 
1998 to 2.1 percent in 2002. In these last three years, it was within the interval of 2-4 percent, as 
targeted by the Bank of Albania.  
Monetary program of 2004 
2. 
Pursuant to drafting and implementing the monetary policy, the Bank of Albania designs each year the 
monetary program, which is a financial plan aiming at disciplining the funds circulation in economy, in 
conformity with the development objectives of the country. The main objective is meeting the needs of 
the  economy  for  monetary  assets,  without  influencing  the  balance  of  demand-supply  for  monetary 
assets, generating thus inflation or shrinking the economy.  
The monetary program of 2004 has also been set up on the same premises. Its not a secret the fact 
that in the coming year as well, as in the previous ones, the two main decision-making institutions of 
the country in the field of economics and finances, the Albanian Government and the Bank of Albania, 
have agreed upon the general objectives of the country’s development, including also the so called 
harmonized cohabitation between the fiscal and monetary policies. This process, albeit all, was part of 
a constructive consultation with institutions such as IFM and the WB, enabling thus a new financial 
agreement between these two institutions for 2004.

 Inflation and monetary policy in 2004 
2.1 
The monetary policy of the Bank of Albania during 2003 was characterized by easing trends of the 
monetary  conditions,  in  compliance  with  the  lessening  the  inflationary  pressures  and  improving  the 
monetary indicators. The Bank of Albania took up the implementation of an easing monetary policy 
since April 2003 reducing the core interest rate by 0.5 percentage point. In July and October 2003, 
there were two other reductions by 0.5 percentage point each, bringing the core interest rate at the 
level it was at the beginning of the previous year. At the end of November 2003, the core interest rate 
was 7.0 percent; the annual inflation rate for that month was 3.4 percent, whereas the average annual 
inflation by the end of October was just 2.24 percent. 
The  Bank  of  Albania  has  been  present  in  the  foreign  exchange  market  throughout  2003  by  buying 
foreign exchange. The foreign exchange activity of the Bank of Albania helped in injecting liquidity in 
the market and it has smoothed the Lek appreciating tendencies during the year. 
The forecasts for the main trends and inflation for 2004, suggest that the Bank of Albania should apply 
a  similar  policy  in  2004,  too.  Developments  in  the  consumption  prices  are  characterized  by  low 
inflationary pressures. Our forecasts show that the inflation target of the Bank of Albania will be met 
during  2003.  In  case  no  shock  phenomena  emerge,  inflation  will  be  under  control  also  for  2004. 
Besides,  the  expectations  on  the  economy  seem  to  speak  about  an  inflation  level  sticking  to  the 
present  one.  Liquidity  ratios  and  structures  seem  to  be  near  their  historic  levels,  whereas  interests 
rates  were  characterized  by  downward  trends  during  2003.  Therefore,  the  Bank  of  Albania  might 
reconsider the possibility of a further reduction of interest rates, a possibility consisting in the future 
performance of the monetary and inflationary indicators. This will be in support of the economic activity 
or inflation target. Judging from the analysis of actual trends, we could say that interest rates during 
2004 will be generally stable or in downward trend. 
The analysis of monetary indicators for 2004 shows that the Bank of Albania is going to be present in 
the  foreign  exchange  market  so  as  to  impede  the  further  appreciation  of  Lek.  Judging  from  the 
monetary indicators of these recent years, we notice that Lek supply (M2 growth) in the internal market 
has been declining due to the lack of government’s privatization incomes, which the Bank of Albania 
converted  in  Lek  by  injecting  liquidity  in  the  market.  The  reduced  Lek  supplies,  together  with  its 
increased demand (due to the high interests rates of financial assets in Lek during 2003), have been 
exercising pressures on the Lek appreciation during 2003.

Main suppositions of the monetary program of the Bank of Albania for 2004 
3. 
In designing the monetary program for 2004 particular attention was given to the Bank of Albania’s 
target, that is keeping up the annual inflation rate within the limits of 2-4 percent. In hitting this 
target,  the  monetary  program  aims  the  control  of  money  supply  growth  so  that  the  level  of  real 
monetary assets responds to the real needs of the economy for a 6 percent economic growth. The 
economy demand forecast does still rely on the quasi-constant velocity forecast of money circulation. 
This forecast, judging from the nominal GDP level, is the bridging gap between inflation and money 
supply growth (intermediate objective).  
The  monetary  program  guarantees  the  observance  of  quantitative  objectives  set  by  the  Bank  of 
Albania,  the  level  of  NDA  and  NIR  of  the  Bank  of  Albania  within  the  limits  and  the  control  of 
government’s domestic borrowing at the level of 2.7 of the GDP. 
Money supply and its constituents 
3.1 
Money velocity is forecasted to be relatively stable during 2004. This assumption is based on keeping 
up the monetary developments trends of 2003 even for 2004. Thus: 
• 
• 
• 
Inflation is expected to be within the target of the Bank of Albania  
Interests rates are expected to be stable or in downward trend 
The government demand, which is also the main source of requiring funds, is expected to be 
at the same level, 2.7 percent of the GDP 
The growth rate demand for the economy is expected to be almost the same as the 2003 
one.  
 Based on these considerations, the M3 circulation velocity - as to trimesters - is presented as follows:

Based on this forecast, the money supply is expected to grow by 10.6 percent or by Lek 47.4 billion. 
 Money supply constituents 
3.1.1 
The ratio of money outside banks versus the money supply noticed during 2003 is not expected to 
undergo  significant  changes  during  the  coming  year.  However,  an  upward  trend  of  the  foreign 
currency deposits ratio versus M3 is expected, bringing about a decrease of the Lek deposits weight 
versus  money  supply.  Foreign  currency  deposits  are  expected  to  have  a  considerable  annual 
increase, of about 18.2 percent, or Lek 17.7 billion, by the end of 2004.

Generally, the M2 aggregate growth will follow the performance of the economy demand for monetary 
assets. This demand is expected to higher in the first trimester of the next year.

Achieving equilibriums of monetary indicators and the reduction of the core interest rate down to the 
levels  of  early  2002,  are  expected  to  provide  the  normal  growth  of  the  M1  aggregate.  Demand 
deposits in Lek are forecasted to be slightly higher in the coming year. However, the strongest impact 
on  the  M1  aggregate  growth  will  be  the  growth  of  money  outside  banks.  Money  outside  banks  is 
forecasted to increase by Lek 14.9 billion in the next year. Money outside banks ratio versus money 
supply is assumed to be round the level of 28.0 percent. Such a forecast is based on the fact that this 
ratio has generally appeared as an equilibrium level in the Albanian economy. Also, the forecast for a 
stability (or fall) of interest rates, gives a greater back up to this assumption. However, considering the 
historic trends, this ratio is expected to have an upward trend in the last trimester of the year.  
Money outside banks performance according to the monetary program will also enable the observance 
of NDA objective of the Bank of Albania. Taking it for granted that the NIR performance of the Bank of 
Albania will stick to the program, the forecasted NDA realization would be as follows:

The annual increase of Lek deposits is forecasted to help meeting the economy demands for domestic 
monetary assets from commercial banks. The Lek deposits increase in the next year is forecasted to 
be Lek 14.8 billion, while the demand for monetary assets in Lek of the government and that of the 
private sector is forecasted to be Lek 14.5 billion. This will provide a stable situation of liquidity in the 
banking system during 2004.  
The banking system is forecasted to meet completely the needs of the private sector for loans in Lek 
as  well  as  the  demand  of  the  government  for  deficit  financing  up  to  62.5  percent  of  the  total 
financing  of  Lek  20.0  billion.  The  Bank  of  Albania  might  finance  up  to  5  percent  of  the  average 
government  revenues  in  these  three  last  years,  or  nearly  Lek  7.5  billion.  As  a  result,  borrowing  or 
investment of free funds of second-tier banks at the Bank of Albania will ease the misbalance effects 
between the demand and supply for domestic monetary assets on the liquidity performance during the 
year. 
                                                      
2   Forecasts on the NDA and NIR objective growth during 2004 are based on the growth of gross foreign currency reserve by 
USD 45 million and the growth of the reserve money by nearly Lek 17.9 billion until the end 2004.

The demand of the economy for monetary assets 
Currency position of the banking system 
3.2.1 
Net  foreign  currency  assets  of  the  banking  system  for  the  next  year  are  forecasted  to  increase  by 
nearly  Lek  8.6  billion  or  5.1  percent  from  the  previous  year.  The  increase  of  NFCA  of  the  banking 
system will mainly come due to the increase of net foreign currency assets of the Bank of Albania, 
which will increase by Lek 7.1 billion. This is a 7.2 percent increase of the NFCA as compared to the 
2.2 percent increase forecasted for 2003. 
The forecasted increase of foreign currency reserves of the Bank of Albania during 2004 at the level of 
Lek 5.4 billion will be the main source of the NFCA increase. Denominated in foreign currency, this 
increase is USD 45 million. Most part of this increase is expected to be the outcome of the foreign 
currency purchase from the Bank of Albania.

The remaining part of Lek 1.7 billion is expected to come from the increase of the commercial banks 
reserves at the Bank of Albania. 
Net foreign currency assets of commercial banks will increase by Lek 1.5 billion, or 2.2 percent. The 
NFCA increase of commercial banks is forecasted to be at a low level, despite the annual increase by 
Lek 17.7 billion of deposits in foreign currency. From this sum, nearly Lek 14.5 billion are expected to 
be used in financing the private sector borrowing, while the remaining part will raise the commercial 
banks reserves at the Bank of Albania.

institutions  and  households  in  the  treasury  bills  market  has demonstrated upward  trends  in  the  last 
two years. In the coming year, their deficit financing is expected to reach the value of Lek 2.6 billion. 
Budget deficit financing from the banking system in 2004 is forecasted to be Lek 20 billion or 
2.3 percent of the GDP. 
The law provided the Bank of Albania to finance the budget deficit up to the level of 5 percent of the 
average budgetary government revenues during these three last years. In absolute value, this limit is 
estimated  to  be  Lek  7.7  billion.  The  monetary  program  for  2004 forecasts  that  the  Bank  of  Albania 
financing of the budget deficit will be Lek 7.5 billion. This financing by the Bank of Albania is necessary 
in covering the budget deficit, considering a small growth of the M2 and Lek deposits. The monetary 
program forecasts that the increase of Lek deposits during 2004 will be sufficient in covering the other 
part of Lek 12.5 billion of the deficit financing from the banking system.  
The following table shows the allocation as to trimesters of the budget deficit financing for the banking 
system.

The Bank of Albania financing is assumed to be the same throughout the four trimesters, providing 
thus  the  financing  performance  from commercial  banks  according  to  the  demand  forecasted  by  the 
government. However, the allocation of the Bank of Albania financing may undergo potential changes 
depending on the liquidity performance of the banking system from one trimester to the other.  
Credit to the economy 
3.2.3 
The  business  needs  for  borrowing  to  support  their  businesses  have  been  growing  in  these  recent 
years. The same tendency is expected for 2004, too. Credit to the economy for the next year is 
forecasted to increase by Lek 16.5 billion. Compared to the credit balance increase in 2003, this 
one is nearly Lek 3.6 billion, or 28 percent higher. 
The credit to the economy forecast is based on its performance during the last nine months. Albeit the 
high-level of liquidity during this year, the credit balance increase was lower than in the previous years. 
In the next year, the credit balance increase in Lek is expected to keep the same rates, marking an 
annual increase of Lek 2 billion in absolute value.  
Foreign currency credit increase is expected to be nearly Lek 14.5 billion, or 88 percent of the total 
increase  of  the  credit  to  the  economy.  The  difference  between  the  credit  interest  rates  in  Lek  and 
those in foreign currency is assumed to be one of main reasons of the slow increase of credit in Lek. 
Moreover, the high level of the banking system liquidity during 2003 does not seem to have influenced 
the increase of the credit balance in Lek. 
The higher increase of the credit balance to the economy forecasted for 2004 is based on the upward 
tendency  of  private  sector  financing  needs.  Meanwhile,  the  forecast  for  a  small  increase  of  Lek 
2 billion, or 12 percent of the Lek crediting, is based on higher interest rates of Lek rather than foreign 
currency crediting. 
The assumption to approach the crediting interests rates in Lek and in foreign currency, would also 
alter the forecasts on the credit balance increase, for the respective currencies in the future.
