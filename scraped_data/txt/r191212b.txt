  I. Economic Activity at Home and Abroad 
A. Recent Developments in Overseas Economies 
Let me start with developments in overseas economies. 
 
The global economy has continued to grow moderately, but the pace of growth has been 
decelerating since the start of 2019. According to the October 2019 World Economic Outlook 
released by the International Monetary Fund, the global growth rate for 2019 is projected to 
be 3.0 percent, a lower rate compared to 3.8 percent for 2017 and 3.6 percent for 2018 (Chart 
1). The continued deceleration is mainly due to a significant slowdown and stagnation in 
world  trade  volume  caused  by  the  intensified  U.S.-China  trade  conflict. This  has  exerted 
downward pressure on the Chinese economy, which is one of the hubs of global supply chains, 
and its effects are spreading across the global economy, including Japan. 
 
Looking at developments by region, the U.S. economy has expanded moderately, albeit at a 
somewhat  slower  pace.  No  significant  problems  have  been  observed  in  U.S.  economic 
fundamentals, with solid consumption sustained amid the historically low unemployment rate, 
and  an  increase  in  housing  investment  mainly  due  to  lower  interest  rates. The  European 
economy has been in low growth, partly reflecting the effects of the economic slowdown in 
China, one of the euro area's main trading partners, in addition to confusion over the United 
Kingdom's  exit  from  the  European  Union.  Emerging  economies  have  shown  mixed 
movements, but in Asian countries -- where economic ties with China are deep -- global trade 
issues have affected production and exerted downward pressure on growth in these economies. 
Given the ongoing U.S.-China trade conflict and heightened geopolitical risks worldwide, it 
is unlikely that uncertainties regarding the outlook for the global economy will be dispelled 
soon. 
 
Some of these regions are proceeding with policy actions amid growing concerns over the 
outlook for the global economy. For example, additional easing measures have already been 
implemented in the United States and Europe, and economic stimulus measures have been 
taken in China. These policy actions have been effective in underpinning economic activity 
to a certain extent; however, they are not strong enough to outweigh the impact of the U.S.-
China trade conflict, which has been more extensive and prolonged than initially anticipated.

 B. Outlook for Overseas Economies 
Concerns remain that overseas economies may decelerate even further due to the impact of 
the intensified and prolonged U.S.-China trade conflict. However, there are potential upside 
risks  as  well.  For  example,  economic  measures  implemented  so  far  may  show  a  greater 
influence in the first half of 2020 than initially anticipated, and the reorganization of supply 
chains in response to the trade conflict may accelerate. As I have already mentioned, the 
current slowdown in global economic growth has been mainly induced by the significant 
slowdown  in  world  trade  volume.  Moreover,  there  is  a  marked  contrast  between  the 
manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors: while production and exports continue to slow 
mainly  in  the  manufacturing  sector,  the  nonmanufacturing  sector  has  been  maintaining 
moderate  expansion.  It  seems  that  the  resilience  in  the  nonmanufacturing  sector,  which 
accounts for a large share of the global economy, has been underpinning global economic 
growth. 
 
C. Recent Developments in Japan's Economy 
Next, I will talk about developments in Japan's economy. 
 
Japan's exports and production continue to show some weakness, mainly in the manufacturing 
sector,  having  been  affected  by  the  slowdown  in  overseas  economies,  particularly  China 
(Chart 2). On the other hand, domestic demand has continued to expand moderately. Business 
fixed investment has continued to see firm growth, mainly in the nonmanufacturing sector, 
and private consumption has been increasing moderately, with the employment and income 
situation  improving.  Moreover,  public  investment  has  recently  begun  to  expand. 
Developments in the economy from late 2018 show that firm domestic demand has continued 
to more than offset relatively weak external demand, and the real GDP growth rate registered 
positive growth for four consecutive quarters (Chart 3). The output gap has also remained 
positive. Given these developments, it can be assessed that a virtuous cycle from income to 
spending  has  continued  to  operate.  Nonetheless,  the  effects  on  Japan's  economy  of 
developments in the global economy and of the October 2019 consumption tax hike need to 
be carefully examined for the time being. 
 
2 
 I will elaborate on recent developments in Japan's economy from two aspects, the demand 
side and the supply side. On the demand side, there is little prospect of a rapid recovery in 
exports, as the slowdown in overseas economies is expected to continue for the time being. 
Meanwhile, the moderate increase in domestic demand is likely to be sustainable, as private 
consumption,  business  fixed  investment,  public  investment  and  other  sectors  have  been 
resilient. 
 
Looking  at  developments  by  demand  component,  private  consumption  has  continued  to 
increase moderately, albeit with fluctuations mainly resulting from weather conditions. This 
increase has been supported by solid employee income reflecting the increased labor force 
participation particularly of women and seniors (Chart 4). As for business fixed investment, 
there has been an increase in not only software investment aimed at saving labor but also 
investment intended for domestic capacity expansion as well as research and development 
(R&D) investment with an eye toward future growth (Chart 5). This mainly reflects the fact 
that Japan's GDP has continued to grow at a pace above its potential, albeit moderately, and 
the need to meet rapidly increasing inbound demand. Looking at business fixed investment 
in detail by industry, the share of the nonmanufacturing sector has reached around 70 percent 
recently.  There  is  some  possibility  that  the  adverse  impact  on  Japan's  business  fixed 
investment of the slowdown in overseas economies will be limited, underpinned by business 
fixed  investment  related  to  resilient  domestic  demand.  Turning  to  public  investment, 
investments associated with disaster-related restoration and reconstruction as well as with 
national resilience have begun to increase and are expected to compensate for a peak-out of 
demand for construction related to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games (Chart 6). 
 
Next,  I  will  turn  to  developments  on  the  supply  side.  It  is  important  that  business  fixed 
investment -- which has been expanding continuously -- positively affects not only demand 
but also supply, in terms of the enhancement of production capacity. Particularly in industries 
facing  labor  shortages,  there  has  been  active  business  fixed  investment  with  the  aim  of 
improving labor productivity. This has been raising capital intensity, or capital per worker. 
While such active investment among some industries acts to induce price rises by raising the 
potential  growth  rate,  the  increase  in  productivity  seems  to  have  been  acting  as  a  factor 
3 
 constraining upward pressure on prices by easing upward pressure on wages. I will come 
back to this point later. 
 
D. Outlook for Japan's Economy 
With  regard  to  the  outlook  for  Japan's  economy  going  forward,  economic  developments 
warrant cautious monitoring over the next six months or so, as the consumption tax hike 
conducted in October is expected to have an impact in the short term -- although its effects 
seem smaller than those of the previous hike in April 2014 -- and the transition of the global 
economy to a moderate recovery path is unlikely to take place until around mid-2020. 
 
Under these circumstances, the pace of Japan's moderate economic growth may decelerate in 
the short term. At the same time, however, such deceleration is unlikely to continue in the 
medium to long term. This is because, owing to the continuation of monetary easing over the 
past  seven  years,  there  has  been  significant  improvement  in  the  employment  situation, 
prolonged labor shortages have encouraged firms to change their behavior, and a virtuous 
economic  cycle  has  been  operating  by  means  of  an  increasing  trend  in  business  fixed 
investment. Moreover, with steady business fixed investment in the nonmanufacturing sector, 
which accounts for a large proportion of such investment, there has been a steady increase in 
the  robustness  of  Japan's  economy  to  external  shock,  namely  the  slowdown  in  overseas 
economies. For the time being, it is important to carefully examine developments in the global 
economy  and  their  effects  on  Japan's  economy.  Nevertheless,  we  should  not  be  overly 
pessimistic about the outlook. Given that the pace of decline in the working-age population 
(those aged 15-64) will continue to exceed that in the total population for the time being, 
labor market conditions are likely to remain tight. In this situation, expansion in business 
fixed investment -- particularly that intended to address labor shortages -- and firm private 
consumption are highly likely to be sustained (Chart 7). 
 
According to the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices released by the Bank of Japan in 
October 2019, the medians of the Policy Board members' forecasts for the real GDP growth 
rate are 0.6 percent for fiscal 2019, 0.7 percent for fiscal 2020, and 1.0 percent for fiscal 2021 
(Chart 8).

 II. Prices 
A. Recent Price Developments and Their Background 
Next, I will turn to price developments. 
 
The year-on-year rate of increase in Japan's consumer price index (CPI) for all items less 
fresh food has continued to rise moderately within the range of 0.0-0.5 percent (Chart 9). The 
year-on-year increase has been in positive territory for three years, affirming the improved 
robustness of the economy to the possibility of falling back into deflation. However, we have 
not yet reached a situation where the inflation rate is further accelerating and approaching 
close to the 2 percent price stability target. Gradual changes in Japan's inflation mechanism 
in recent years may account for this situation, in which the economy is no longer in deflation 
but is not seeing an acceleration in inflation. 
 
Three factors in Japan's current inflation mechanism are relevant in this context: one factor is 
exerting upward pressure on prices, namely, the continuing positive output gap; while the 
other two factors are constraining inflation, specifically, the persistent deflationary mindset 
of the public and improvements in labor productivity.   
 
First,  the  output  gap  --  the  factor  exerting  upward  pressure  on  prices  --  has  remained 
consistently positive since the October-December quarter of 2016. In fact, the inflation rate 
and the output gap have been running in parallel with each other, with a certain time lag. This 
correlation indicates that the positive output gap has been acting as a factor placing upward 
pressure on prices. 
 
Let me turn to the two factors constraining inflation. As for the first factor -- namely, the 
persistent deflationary mindset -- this cost-saving mentality has become deeply entrenched 
among consumers due to their experience of prolonged deflation, and has been influencing 
the cautious price-setting stance of Japanese firms. In the formation of inflation expectations, 
the  backward-looking  expectation  that  reflects  past  inflation  rates  --  that  is,  the  adaptive 
formation mechanism -- is more prominent in Japan than the forward-looking expectation 
that reflects future economic conditions and changes in policy measures. This accounts for 
the persistent deflationary mindset. 
5 
 Another factor constraining inflation relates to improvements in labor productivity, effects of 
which  have  been  observed  since  around  2017.  While  the  labor  market  is  close  to  full 
employment, upward pressure on wages has not particularly increased. This is partly due to 
the fact that there was room for restraining wage increases as the labor force participation rate 
rose in parallel with the intensification of labor shortages; moreover, it is worth noting that, 
with  the  anticipation  of  longstanding  labor  shortages,  firms  embarked  on  labor-saving 
investments,  which  in  turn  resulted  in  improvements  in  labor  productivity.  From  the 
viewpoint of the output gap, a further widening of the gap within positive territory has been 
avoided by reducing labor input. Improvements in labor productivity have prevented firms 
from passing increased costs, such as personnel expenses and raw material costs, on to sales 
prices  (Chart  10).  In  other  words,  improvements  in  labor  productivity  have  constrained 
inflation through the expansion in business fixed investment. 
 
B. Outlook 
As the inflation mechanism has become more complex, it is not easy to forecast the outlook 
for prices. First, a positive inflation rate is necessary to overcome the persistent deflationary 
mindset  grounded  in  the  adaptive  formation  mechanism.  Assuming  that  the  output  gap 
remains positive, the key will be predicting the outlook for the remaining factor -- namely, 
the constraining effects on inflation due to improvements in labor productivity. The rise in 
labor productivity promoting changes in the economic structure should be taken into account 
when considering the outlook. That is to say, changes on the supply side not only act as a 
factor constraining inflation but also raise the growth potential of the economy. 
 
With  heightened  uncertainty  over  the  outlook  for  the  global  economy,  the  immediate 
challenge for Japan's economy is to sustain the positive output gap and prevent any halt to 
the changes in the economic structure that have begun to progress, by maintaining moderate 
growth  supported  by  steady  domestic  demand.  If  these  immediate  challenges  are  met 
appropriately,  we  should  anticipate  --  while  keeping  the  economy  free  of  deflation  --  a 
moderate acceleration in the inflation rate when the labor force participation rate eventually 
stops  rising  and  encourages  real  wage  increases  to  catch  up  with  the  pace  of  growth  in 
productivity. 
 
6 
 Risks to the outlook for prices also warrant vigilance. If the slowdown in overseas economies 
continues for longer than anticipated, and the output gap reverses back into negative territory, 
Japan's economy may face deflation again. As for now, given that the positive output gap is 
being maintained on the back of steady domestic demand, the Bank should spare no effort in 
preparing  for  circumstances  where  additional  policy  actions  may  be  necessary,  while 
carefully examining future economic developments both at home and abroad. In order to 
maintain the inflation momentum, it is important to be fully prepared for the global economy 
to recover. 
 
III. Monetary Policy 
A. Current Monetary Easing Policy and Its Basic Framework 
The basic framework for the Bank's current monetary easing policy introduced in September 
2016  is  Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Monetary  Easing  (QQE)  with Yield  Curve  Control. 
Under this framework, with the aim of achieving the price stability target under yield curve 
control -- in which short- and long-term interest rates are controlled -- the Bank sets the short-
term  policy  interest  rate  at  minus  0.1  percent  and  the  target  level  for  10-year  Japanese 
government bond (JGB) yields at around 0 percent. It also purchases JGBs to facilitate the 
formation of these interest rates consistent with yield curve control. Subsequently, in July 
2018, the Bank introduced forward guidance, and in April 2019, decided on a set of policy 
measures, including expanding eligible collateral for its provision of credit, to enhance the 
sustainability of the monetary easing policy. Furthermore, at the most recent Monetary Policy 
Meeting held in October 2019, the Bank revised its forward guidance with a view to clarifying 
the need to continue examining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target. 
 
Alongside the implementation of these policy measures, the Bank continues with large-scale 
monetary  easing.  In  carrying  out  its  policy,  I  believe  it  is  essential  for  the  Bank  to  be 
committed  to  continuing  with  monetary  easing  by  examining  matters  from  a  broad 
perspective, including developments in financial markets and the financial system as well as 
economic activity and prices, while carefully considering the balance between the positive 
effects and the side effects of continuing monetary easing.

 B. Future Conduct of Monetary Policy 
The Bank is committed to continuing with the current powerful monetary easing. Let me raise 
the following as points requiring particular attention in the future conduct of monetary policy: 
(1) the effects on Japan's economy of the slowdown in the global economy; (2) the balance 
between the positive effects and the side effects of continuing monetary easing; and (3) the 
conduct  of  monetary  policy  amid  changes  in  the  economic  structure  and  in  the  inflation 
mechanism. 
 
The first point warrants considerable attention currently in predicting the outlook for Japan's 
economic  activity.  If  overseas  economies  slow  further  and  negative  effects  on  Japan's 
economic activity materialize, it may become necessary to take policy actions. In this case, it 
will be important that such actions should be decided after examining the scale of the negative 
effects and how fast they spread. 
 
For example, if the economy faces a crisis, such as that which could threaten the financial 
system during the global financial crisis, this will lead to a rapid economic downturn through 
credit contraction. Therefore, decisive actions would be necessary. On the other hand, if the 
slowdown in overseas economies stemming from trade issues remains moderate, the speed 
with which it spreads to Japan's economy will also be moderate. Thus, there will be room to 
take policy actions after carefully examining developments in economic indicators. The issue 
of side effects is another reason why policymakers should refrain from taking hasty policy 
actions in the conduct of future monetary policy. 
 
Regarding the second point, namely the balance between the positive effects and the side 
effects of continuing monetary easing, it is becoming increasingly necessary to pay attention 
to the side effects on the financial system of continuing with the low interest rate policy. With 
limited  demand  for  funds  among  firms,  financial  institutions'  lending  margins  have  been 
narrowing  due  mainly  to  the  prolonged  low  interest  rate  environment  (Chart  11).  These 
institutions are increasing their amount of risk-taking in order to acquire profits. However, 
due to globally accommodative financial conditions, the number of borrowers or entities in 
which financial institutions can invest to secure profits commensurate with their risk-taking 
8 
 is limited, and the possibility is increasing that risks will materialize and financial institutions' 
capital adequacy ratios plunge in the event of an economic downturn.   
 
At the moment, the capital adequacy ratios of all types of financial institutions in Japan appear 
to be sufficient relative to the levels of regulatory requirements. Nevertheless, as the ratios 
have been on a declining trend, mainly those of regional financial institutions, it is becoming 
necessary to monitor more closely with the continuation of monetary easing. The Bank will 
examine risks in the financial system through various means, such as the Financial System 
Report,  as  well  as  on-site  examinations  and  off-site  monitoring,  and  when  necessary, 
encourage financial institutions to address these risks. It will also open dialogue with a wide 
range of relevant parties, including the Bank's Center for Advanced Financial Technology, to 
help resolve the challenges facing financial institutions. As for the conduct of monetary policy, 
it is important for the Bank to make policy decisions in an appropriate manner while carefully 
examining the side effects of policy measures on the financial system. 
 
Lastly, as for the third point, the relationship between monetary policy and prices is no longer 
straightforward, as seen, for example, in an improvement in labor productivity accompanying 
labor-saving investment constraining inflation. As a result, uncertainty in this context is likely 
to remain high. In what follows, I would like to provide a somewhat detailed explanation of 
such changes in the economic structure and appropriate monetary policy in response to these 
changes. 
 
IV. Structural Changes in Japan's Economy and the Role of Monetary Policy 
I  will  now  describe  the  structural  changes  in  Japan's  economy  and  the  points  that  have 
recently come to require attention. 
 
Supported by a policy mix of monetary and fiscal policies that has been sustained over the 
past seven years, there have been slow but steady structural changes in the economy. These 
can be largely divided into changes in the industrial structure accompanying globalization, 
and the establishment of a virtuous cycle stemming from longstanding shortages of labor. 
These have resulted in other changes in Japan, such as the increased expectation of a rise in 
the economy's growth potential owing to the expansion of supply capacity, and an increase in 
9 
 the robustness of the economy to changes in the external environment. I will touch on each 
of  these  points  in  order,  and  then  explain  how  monetary  policy  should  be  conducted  in 
response to these structural changes. 
 
A. Changes in the Industrial Structure Accompanying Globalization 
Japanese manufacturers have been expanding their businesses in overseas markets since the 
beginning  of  the  globalization  trend  that  has  lasted  for  over  four  decades  following  the 
collapse  of  the  Bretton Woods  system.  Consequently,  the  share  of  the  nonmanufacturing 
sector in Japan's GDP, which is a measure of overall domestic production, accounts for about 
80  percent.  Japan's  outward  direct  investment  has  expanded  rapidly  with  significant 
adjustments  in  foreign  exchange  rates  since  the  latter  half  of  the  1980s,  leading  to  the 
establishment of current global supply chains. 
 
Reflecting the structural change of manufacturers' shifting their production sites overseas, the 
contribution of income generated through outward direct investment and outward portfolio 
investment, which is the fruit of firms' outward investment, has tended to increase in Japan's 
current  account  (Chart  12).  At  present,  Japan's  current  account  surplus  accounts  for 
approximately 4 percent of nominal GDP, and this consists mostly of gains from outward 
direct investment and outward portfolio investment. Japan's nominal gross national income 
(GNI) -- which is a measure of the nation's nominal GDP plus net income from overseas 
sources -- is about 4 percent larger than GDP, showing that Japan's economic structure has 
steadily changed to one in which manufacturers make profits from production overseas. 
 
B. Virtuous Cycle of the Economy amid Longstanding Shortages of Labor 
Let  me  now  turn  to  structural  changes  in  Japan's  economy.  Since  around  2017,  amid 
longstanding shortages of labor, some distinctive developments continue to be observed, such 
as moderate growth of the economy, the positive output gap, non-deflationary price rises, and 
an increase in business fixed investment. This suggests that the simultaneous progress of these 
interacting developments has contributed to the sustained operation of a virtuous cycle in 
Japan's economy. 
 
10 
 The positive output gap has been maintained as labor shortages continue amid a growing 
elderly population and a declining working-age population, coupled with the expansion of 
demand induced by monetary and fiscal policies. This seems to have raised the corporate 
sector's expectations that both the moderate expansion of the economy and labor shortages 
are likely to continue in the medium to long term. These raised expectations have led firms 
to  the  assessment  that  it  would  be  possible  to  secure  the  cost-effectiveness  of  their 
investments, including long-term investments, as the positive business environment would be 
maintained  to  a  certain  extent. As  a  result,  fixed  investment  has  expanded,  particularly 
investment aimed at saving labor. 
 
C. Expectations for a Rise in Potential Growth Rate Accompanying the Expansion of 
Supply Capacity 
Business fixed investment is one of the components that make up a nation's GDP. In addition 
to short-term demand, it expands supply by increasing production capacity and improving 
productivity in the medium to long term. As supply capacity has expanded in Japan along 
with the structural change of a continuous expansion of business fixed investment, there is 
the possibility that a moderate increase in the potential growth rate will be induced hereafter, 
with some time lag. 
 
Looking at recent developments in the potential growth rate, while the contribution of labor 
input has been decreasing, that of capital stock and total factor productivity (TFP) has started 
to bottom out (Chart 13). The expansion of business fixed investment, which has continued 
for the past three years, is starting to induce a supply-side structural change. Together with an 
increase in R&D investment with an eye toward promoting innovation, if the potential growth 
rate rises in the future -- in which case the natural rate of interest will also rise, causing real 
interest rates to fall below the natural rate of interest -- the same level of policy rate will have 
a greater easing effect. 
 
D. Increased Robustness to Changes in External Demand 
Another structural change I should point to is the increased robustness of the economy to 
changes  in  external  demand.  Given  the  established  global  supply  chains,  Japanese 
manufacturers have divided their production at home and abroad as follows: (1) overseas sites 
11 
 producing for their own local market and for export to third countries, and (2) Japanese sites 
producing for Japan's domestic market. This division has likely resulted in a mitigated adverse 
effect that a slowdown in external demand would have on Japan's GDP through a decrease in 
exports. 
 
Given the geopolitical background to the U.S.-China trade conflict, it is entirely possible, 
depending on future developments, that existing global supply chains may be reorganized, 
particularly with respect to China. Nonetheless, I expect that such reorganization will not 
greatly  affect  the  decision  making  of  Japanese  firms  regarding  where  to  establish  their 
production sites -- whether in Japan or abroad, whether for export or for local production. 
This is because the division of work among production sites at home and abroad has already 
been established to a certain extent, and it is difficult to imagine any significant decline in 
domestic business fixed investment, even if overseas production were relocated to a different 
country. Moreover, it is highly likely that domestic business fixed investment will continue 
to  expand  in  light  of  other  structural  changes,  such  as  firm  investment  by  the 
nonmanufacturing sector and labor shortages that are expected to continue in the medium to 
long term. 
 
E. Monetary Policy Supporting Structural Changes in Japan's Economy 
The fundamental role of monetary policy is to achieve price stability, thereby realizing and 
maintaining a sound macroeconomic environment. The Bank's monetary policy itself does 
not have a direct impact in terms of altering Japan's economic structure. However, as the 
large-scale monetary easing policy has been in place for almost seven years, many indicators 
suggest that Japan's economy has improved, and prices are no longer in deflation. Even since 
the start of this year, solid domestic demand has supported a continued moderate expansion, 
despite the economy being affected somewhat by the slowdown in the global economy caused 
by the intensified U.S.-China trade conflict. 
 
Increased  robustness  to  changes  in  external  demand  has  helped  sustain  Japan's  moderate 
economic  growth,  even  in  the  face  of  a  continuing  slowdown  in  the  global  economy. As 
favorable economic conditions have been maintained, structural changes in the economy have 
brought about this increased robustness. In other words, being committed to continuing with 
12 
 large-scale monetary easing policy has led to improvements in economic activity, thereby 
indirectly supporting the structural changes in the economy. 
 
Moreover, the current monetary easing policy has been effective owing partly to the stability 
of the whole macroeconomic policy framework. The government and the Bank have clearly 
shared  a  basic  understanding  of  the  policy  mandate  and  the  division  of  their  roles  in 
conducting  the  monetary  and  fiscal  policy  mix.  While  monetary  policy  aims  to  directly 
stabilize the economy, fiscal policy aims not only to stimulate the economy as a whole but 
also to implement a structural policy through such channels as budgetary allocations. It seems 
evident that both the stabilization of the economy in recent years and the smooth structural 
changes that have occurred can be attributed to this mix of  monetary and fiscal policies, 
grounded in macroeconomic policy. 
 
Furthermore, it is also important to note from a global perspective that Japan's economy has 
been generally stable in recent years. At present, there are no large differences in the levels 
of price targets among major advanced countries, and since the start of the year their monetary 
policies have tended to be more or less accommodative. Also, as a decade has passed since 
the global financial crisis, the balance between the size of the central bank's balance sheet and 
the money supply in each of the major advanced countries has been quite stable (Chart 14). 
In  other  words,  this  could  be  seen  as  an  indication  that  the  difference  in  the  levels  of 
quantitative easing in major countries has declined. In addition, as Japan's economy continues 
to be no longer in deflation, there has been a significant decline in the difference between 
major countries' inflation rates -- which affects the long-term nominal exchange rate in light 
of purchasing power parity (PPP) (Chart 15). Under these circumstances, financial markets 
may fluctuate in the short term in reaction to news reports, but in the long run appear to move 
only within a certain range. This suggests that the similarity of global monetary policies in 
major countries is constraining market fluctuations, thereby contributing -- together with the 
increased robustness of the economy to changes in external demand -- to the stabilization of 
Japan's economy. 
 
13 
 Japan's  accommodative  monetary  policy  supports  structural  changes  in  the  economy  by 
sustaining  a  policy  mix  with  fiscal  policy,  and  through  the  similarity  of  global  monetary 
policies. It also functions as an anchor that constrains fluctuations in financial markets. 
 
Among the concerns that have emerged in light of the U.S.-China trade conflict, there are 
worries  regarding  frameworks  of  international  cooperation,  which  have  come  under 
considerable strain. The outlook for global trade issues is a matter for concern. Nevertheless, 
while Japan's policy mix and global accommodative financial conditions are maintained, I 
consider the important policy issue for Japan is to sustain the positive output gap and support 
the  changes  to  the  economic  structure  that  have  begun  by  appropriately  addressing  the 
slowdown in the global economy and waiting patiently for its recovery. 
 
Thank you for your attention.
