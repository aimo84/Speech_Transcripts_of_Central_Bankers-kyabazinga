Jean-Pierre Roth: Switzerland – a platform for global business 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the 
Swiss  National  Bank  and  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Bank  for  International 
Settlements, at the Forum de l'Economie vaudoise, Lausanne, 14 September 2007. 
The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 Within the past ten years, Switzerland has become a genuine platform for global economic 
operations.  From  here,  the  international  markets  are  being  worked  systematically,  and  an 
ever-growing  part  of  our  economic  performance  is  now  attributable  to  investment  activity 
abroad. This is a welcome development since it allows us to keep high value-added jobs in 
Switzerland.  However,  it  also  involves  some  risk  because  the  international  mobility  of 
production  has  increased.  Consequently,  the  general  conditions  which  help  to  keep 
Switzerland attractive as a business location must be maintained.  
This platform for global economic operations has given us a role outside the European Union 
and the euro area. Thus we have chosen to face the challenge of globalisation instead of the 
challenge of European integration. Our path may be demanding, but it is also promising!
