Jean-Pierre Roth: The economic situation – la vie en rose? 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Swiss 
National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at a 
meeting with representatives of Ticino industry, Centro di studi bancari, Vezia, 28 November 2006. 
The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 It is true that our exports continue to benefit from a buoyant global economy, that areas of concern 
such  as  the  volatility  of  oil  prices  or  the  possibility  of  a  significant  and  lasting  downturn  in  the  US 
economy have partially receded, and that the current economic recovery has led to an improvement in 
the  labour  market  without  endangering  price stability.  Is  this  la  vie  en rose  (living  life  through rose-
tinted spectacles)?  
A brief outline of the situation in the national and international economies is given, indicating that the 
overall perspective remains favourable. It concludes with a concise evaluation of the risks, showing 
that the current euphoria may conceal significant risks that we must not lose sight of.
