Mr Yam comments on Hong Kong: from crisis to recovery
Speech by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr Joseph Yam, at the HKMA
Luncheon  on  the  occasion  of  the  opening  of  the  HKMA  Representative  Office  in  London  on
28 September 1999.
 It  is  a  great  pleasure  to  be  speaking  here  in  London  again,  and  to  do  so  at  this  large  and  expert
gathering. Some of you may have been present at my last speaking engagement here, in June last year
at the 11th Dragon Boat Dinner, which now seems like a very, very long time ago. In that speech I
described Hong Kong, against the background of the financial turmoil in Asia, variedly as a pillar of
stability, the eye of the storm and the typhoon shelter of Asia. My message then was that Hong Kong,
with prudent policies and robust financial structures, had been the last and the least to be affected by
the storm.
Since that time, as you all know well, the tail of the storm has swept through Hong Kong and it has not
been so gentle after all. The painful downward adjustment in the internal cost/price structure under a
fixed exchange rate system eventually  and  inevitably  came.  This  was  reflected in  plummeting  asset
prices,  declining  GDP  and  rising  unemployment.  Although  the  fundamentals  of  the  Hong  Kong
economy  remained  sound,  these  events  provided  an  attractive  environment  for  the  launch  of
speculative attacks. And so during the summer of last year we received a severe buffeting from attacks
against  our  currency  and  financial  markets,  threatening  a  financial  meltdown.  We  fought  off  these
attacks in August 1998 with a dramatic and controversial operation in the stock and futures markets.
We accumulated Hong Kong stocks to the value – at that time – of around US$ 15 billion. Since then,
the value of that portfolio has increased to US$ 26 bn, a reflection of the greatly improved financial
environment  and,  even  for  many  of  our  critics,  a  vindication  of  our  operation.  I  should  stress  that
making huge profits was not our primary purpose in this operation. But we are not complaining. The
70%  return  so  far  represents  a  bonus  to  our  reserves:  too  bad  there  are  no  bonuses  for  those
responsible  for  acquiring  the  portfolio.  It  has  been  a  very  productive  investment  for  the  people  of
Hong Kong. And we now have even more resources to safeguard the stability of our currency.
But this large holding of Hong Kong stocks is arguably excessive, having regard to the traditional lack
of involvement of Government in business, and to the potential conflict of interest in its dual role as
regulator and shareholder. Towards the end of this presentation I shall briefly return to the question of
how we intend to set about disposing of this portfolio. Before I do that, I should first like to update you
on the state of our economy as the painful adjustment process draws to a close and as clear signs of
economic recovery emerge. I should also like to address some of the concerns – unnecessary ones, in
my view – that still seem to be clouding the view of Hong Kong from outside.
The recovery
Those of you who heard me in June last year may well be a little sceptical about any advice from me
on  the  outlook  for  the  Hong  Kong  economy.  Although  I  was  under  no  illusion  about  the  less
prosperous  times  that  lay  ahead,  like  many  at  the  time  I  was  perhaps  a  little  too  sanguine  in  my
assessment about the impact that the Asian crisis would have on Hong Kong. However, the temptation
now for many is to go to the other extreme: to be very cautious in making predictions about the future
and to acknowledge signs of recovery only very reluctantly. This is understandable when we are still
only just moving out of our sharpest recession on record. Yet even the pessimists would now, I think,
acknowledge  that  the  storm  signals  are  down,  the  clouds  are  thinning  out,  and  there  are  shafts  of
sunlight  in the  distance.  I  speak  only  metaphorically,  of course.  As those  of  you  who  have  been  in
Hong Kong recently will know, this has been a very stormy summer from a meteorological point of
view: we have just had the worst typhoon in sixteen years and the wettest typhoon since records began
more than a hundred years ago.

Economically, the most recent figures suggest that our wet and windy summer has brought with it a
distinct turn for the better.
