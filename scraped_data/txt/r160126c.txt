 Mark Carney: The turn of the year 
 Text  of  the  Peston  Lecture  by  Mr  Mark  Carney,  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  England  and 
Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Queen Mary University of London, London, 
19 January 2016. 
 I  am  grateful  to  Ben  Nelson  and  Iain  de  Weymarn  for  assistance  in  preparing  these  remarks,  and  to  James 
Cloyne, James Talbot and Matthew Waldron for background research. 
It is a pleasure to be at Queen Mary University of London to give the 2016 Peston Lecture. 
Fifty years ago Lord Peston was invited to take up a Chair in Economics at Queen Mary and 
to found the forerunner of today’s School of Economics and Finance. 
Anniversaries  provide  the  opportunity  to  look  back  and  plan  ahead.  When  doing  so,  it  is 
sometimes helpful to recall Shimon Peres’ definition of a young person as someone whose 
future ambitions exceed their past accomplishments. So while Queen Mary can take justified 
pride  in  its  long-standing  commitment  to  community  engagement  and  widening  local 
participation,  what  is  most  striking  are  your  plans  for  the  future,  including  to  push  forward 
translational research in population-scale genomics, with the potential to bring health benefits 
to people across the UK and beyond. 
Queen Mary is clearly a young institution. 
The turn of the year is also a time for reflection and planning. The beginning of 2016 in the 
UK  is  significant  in  that  it  marks  a  turning  of  a  page  in  banking  regulation  and  a  turn  in 
financial conditions. At the same time, in the MPC’s judgment, it did not yet herald a turn in 
the stance of monetary policy. 
I would like to expand on these developments today, including what they mean for the UK’s 
economic prospects. 
Since the Bank’s full powers came into force a few years ago, we have pursued a strategy: 
1. 
2. 
To rebuild the resilience of the banking system; 
To  maintain  an  accommodative  stance  of  monetary  policy  to  achieve  the  inflation 
target and support the recovery; and 
To develop and deploy a macroprudential toolkit to prevent the emergence of new 
vulnerabilities that could derail that recovery over the medium term. 
3. 
We’ve  made  determined  progress  in  all  respects.  In  particular,  we’ve  reached  inflection 
points in micro and macroprudential policies, and are able to set out the requirements for one 
in monetary policy. In doing so, we have increased the prospects of a durable expansion. 
But the path of policy is not preordained, and continued progress will require both vigilance 
and dexterity. That’s because private and public balance sheets remain stretched. The global 
environment is unforgiving. And the supply side of our economy is still healing. 
Let me expand. 
A resilient banking system 
1. 
I  will  begin  with  the  foundation  upon  which  strong,  sustainable  balanced  growth  is  built:  a 
resilient financial system. The combination of a radical overhaul of the regulatory framework 
and  years  of  determined  effort  has  significantly  strengthened  the  UK  banking  system. 
Consequently,  last  month  the  Financial  Policy  Committee  (FPC)  was  able  to  send  two 
signals that the system had turned the corner. 
First, it has clarified the overall capital framework for banks, providing much needed certainty 
to the sector. While there are details still to be finalised and complexities to be reduced, there

is no new wave of capital regulation coming. There is no Basel IV. Indeed, last week, central 
bank  Governors  and  Heads  of  Supervision  agreed  that  work  to  address  the  problem  of 
excessive variability in risk-weighted assets – one of the final parts of the post crisis capital 
framework – would be completed by the end of 2016 without significantly increasing overall 
capital requirements. 
Second, the FPC now judges that the system is already within sight of the amount of capital 
it needs to have by the end of the decade and has the capacity to continue lending to the real 
economy even under severe stress. 
The  Bank’s  most  recent  stress  test  underscores  these  improvements.  It  focused  on  an 
emerging  market  stress,  centred  on  a  sharp  slowing  of  Chinese  growth,  which  prompts 
reassessments  of  global  economic  prospects,  falls  in  asset  and  commodity  prices  and 
increased global deflationary pressures.1 
Sound familiar? 
Despite  challenging  conditions  abroad,  the  UK  financial  system  can  continue  to  take  the 
types of prudent risks needed to grow jobs and incomes here at home. 
In short, the efforts of banks over the past seven years to rebuild their balance sheets and 
improve  risk  management  are  paying  off.  Mortgage  rates  are  at  all-time  lows.  Corporate 
credit availability has recovered solidly. Lending to small firms is growing again having fallen 
sharply in the wake of the crisis (Chart 1).

1   The  test  was  tough.  In  the  scenario,  gilt  yields  falls  over  100  basis  points,  Bank  Rate  falls  to  zero, 
unemployment  increases  by  3  ½  percentage  points,  and  house  prices  fall  by  one  fifth.  Equity  prices  fall 
sharply – by around twice their recent falls. As a result, equity capital is eroded by around 3 ½ percentage 
points of risk-weighted assets. Yet despite this assumed marked worsening in the global economic weather, 
the FPC judged that UK households and businesses would continue to be supported by our banking system.

  Financial conditions and macroprudential policy 
2. 
The improvement in the price and availability of credit is one sign of the normalisation of the 
UK  financial  environment.  Another  is  that,  after  seven  years  of  deleveraging,  aggregate 
credit to the UK private 
non-financial sector has begun to grow again (Chart 2). 
This  has  not  been  a  debt-fuelled  recovery.  Aggregate  private  credit  growth  is  modest 
compared to pre-crisis conditions, and is just now coming into line with nominal GDP growth 
(Chart 3).

  That said, increased vigilance is merited given the softness in nominal GDP growth, the still-
elevated  levels  of  household  debt  relative  to  income,  the  large  current  account  deficit  and 
pockets  of  more  buoyant  activity  in  areas  such  as  Buy-to-Let  mortgages,  unsecured 
consumer credit and commercial real estate. 
More fundamentally, it doesn’t take a genius to recognise that a prolonged period of low and 
relatively  predictable interest  rates could  encourage  the  build-up  of  excessive  risks.  That’s 
why the Bank is monitoring risks closely and has taken action where appropriate. Targeted 
measures include: 
– 
limits on high Loan-to-Income mortgages introduced last year, which contributed to 
the share of households with very high mortgage debt to income ratios falling back 
to levels last seen in the 1990s (Chart 4);2 
requirements  for  banks  to  assess  whether  borrowers  could  still  afford  their 
mortgages at much higher levels of Bank Rate; and 
the current review of underwriting standards for Buy-to-Let being conducted by the 
Bank’s prudential supervisors.3

2014 in a way that was similar to the patterns seen in the UK housing market in the early 2000s.After FPC action 
line pertains to 2014Q4 – 2015Q3. 
In addition, given the financial system has moved out of the post-crisis period of heightened 
risk aversion, the FPC has made clear its intention to set the Countercyclical Capital Buffer 
above zero before the level of risk becomes elevated. 
With active macroprudential policy, monetary policy can focus on its primary job of inflation 
control. It is that to which I will now turn.

  Objectives, strategy and outlook for monetary policy 
3. 
The obvious question is, if the turn of the year heralded the normalisation of bank regulation 
and macroprudential policy, why not the start of normalisation of monetary policy? After all, 
the  Federal  Reserve  raised  rates  in  December.  Might  the  ‘special  relationship’  extend  to 
monetary matters? 
Of course there is nothing particularly special about foreign central banks’ policy rates. What 
is most important is whether the shocks to which others are responding are similar to those 
with which the MPC must contend. To my mind, there are some important differences in this 
regard: 
 
First, cost pressures are stronger in the US. American unit costs have increased by 
3% in the past year and are growing above historical averages, while unit costs in 
the UK are currently rising by around half that rate or at a speed notably below that 
consistent with the inflation target.4 
Second, the UK economy is twice as open as the US and is therefore more exposed 
to global weakness, dragging on exports.5 
Third, this also means that pass-through of weak global inflation, compounded by 
exchange rate appreciation, is likely to exert a greater and more persistent drag on 
UK  inflation.  Partly  as  a  result,  after  adjusting  for  one-off  factors,  core  inflation  is 
firmer in the US than the UK. 
Fourth, the stance of fiscal policy differs markedly. The UK is undergoing the largest 
fiscal consolidation in the OECD, with the structural deficit projected to decline by 
around 1 percentage point a year on average over the next four years, having fallen 
only  1/3  percentage  point  on  average  over  the  past  three.  In  contrast,  US  fiscal 
policy is expected to loosen notably over next three years. 
Finally, the Bank of England’s control over macroprudential policy reduces the need 
to use monetary policy to address financial stability considerations. 
    Recall that, despite an expansion that started two years before our own, the Fed has only 
raised rates to our lofty level of ½ %. This last point is not facetious. As my MPC colleague 
Jan  Vlieghe  argued  in  a  speech  yesterday,  a  variety  of  structural  factors  have  likely 
depressed  the  so  called  equilibrium  interest  rate,  or  the  rate  consistent  with  the  economy 
operating at full employment and inflation at target.6 Bank staff have estimated many of these 
drivers. In my long-held view, rate rises, when they come, are likely to proceed at a gradual 
pace and to a limited degree for some time. 
Most economics is at the margin, and the tightening of monetary policy – once warranted – is 
likely to be marginal for some time. 
Given all of that, what are the prospects for a rate rise in the UK? 
Last summer I said that the decision as to when to start raising Bank Rate would likely come 
into sharper relief around the turn of this year. 
Well the year has turned, and, in my view, the decision proved straightforward: now is not yet 
the  time  to  raise  interest  rates.  This  wasn’t  a  surprise  to  market  participants  or  the  wider 
public.  They  observed  the  renewed  collapse  in  oil  prices,  the  volatility  in  China,  and  the

moderation in growth and wages here at home since the summer and rightly concluded that 
not enough cumulative progress had been made to warrant tightening monetary policy. 
The outlook for monetary policy depends on three things: the MPC’s objectives, its strategy, 
and the UK’s economic prospects. 
Our objective is clear: to return inflation to the target in a way that avoids undue volatility in 
output and employment. 
The MPC’s strategy for achieving the inflation target varies over time, and it depends on the 
nature of shocks hitting the economy and the risks facing the economy. 
For  conventional  demand  disturbances, 
to  households’ 
consumption  plans,  or  for  one-off  shocks  to  the  price  level,  such  as  a  one-time  fall  in  oil 
prices, a relatively rapid return of inflation to the target, such as in twelve to eighteen months, 
would usually be appropriate. 
When  there  are  large  trade-offs  between  returning  inflation  to  target  and  avoiding  undue 
volatility  in  output  and  employment,  this  horizon  can  be  extended.  In  February  2011,  in 
response to a series of shocks to VAT, the past fall in sterling, and increases in commodity 
prices,  the MPC  decided  to  seek  to  return  inflation  to  target  in  around  two  to  three  years. 
Extending the policy horizon made sense given the substantial slack in the economy, which a 
faster return to target would only have increased.7 
At present, the MPC is seeking to return inflation to the target in around two years and to 
keep it there in the absence of further shocks. We don’t want an overshoot of inflation. 
This  two-year  time  horizon  reflects  the  need  to  balance  the  strength  of  private  domestic 
demand growth against the sustained headwinds from a weak world economy and ongoing 
fiscal consolidation. External factors – including a strong exchange rate and subdued global 
price pressures – can be expected to exert a persistent drag on UK inflation. 
To offset this drag from abroad, domestically-generated inflationary pressures must rise. But 
this  process  must  be  sustainable;  that  is,  it  should  not  come  at  the  expense  of  future, 
excessive volatility in employment and output. 
The MPC’s current policy horizon of around two years reflects our judgment of how best to 
balance these persistent forces while implying a slightly tighter stance of monetary policy, all 
else equal. 
Since monetary policy operates with a lag, it must be forward looking.8 As a result, monetary 
policy will continue to depend on economic prospects not the calendar. 
The UK’s prospects must be assessed in the light of an unusually uncertain supply side of 
the  economy.9  The  financial  crisis  upended  the  certainties  of  the  pre-crisis  years  when 
productivity  progressed  predictably  and  labour  supply  expanded  at  a  steady  pace. 
Productivity growth fell markedly after the crash and, though recently picking up, now seems 
                                                 
7  
Indeed, Lord King’s letter to the Chancellor noted that this would also have entailed risking an undershoot of 
inflation in the medium term once temporary factors had abated. 
8   Estimates of the effects of monetary policy rely on plausible ways of identifying monetary policy shocks. There 
is  a  large  literature  on  this,  which  seeks  to  quantify  the  “long  and  variable  lags”  suggested  by  Friedman. 
Examples include Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005), Uhlig (2005), and Smets and Wouters (2007). 
Estimates for the UK include those in Burgess et al (2013) and Cloyne and Hurtgen (2014). Such estimates 
typically  refer  to  unanticipated  changes  in  interest  rates.  A  challenge  for  this  literature  is  that,  as  noted  by 
Leeper,  Sims  and  Zha  (1996)  and  Bernanke,  Gertler  and  Watson  (1997),  most  of  monetary  policy  is 
endogenous,  meaning policy authorities move  interest rates in response to  economic developments, not in 
spite  of  them,  as  I  emphasise  later.  The  systematic  effects  of  monetary  policy  are  more  complex  to 
characterise.  
9   For the monetary policy implications, see for example Broadbent (2013).

to  be  oscillating  around  a  rate  below  its  historical  average.  And  there  have  been  sharp 
increases  in  labour  supply  caused  by  peoples’  need  to  work  to  help  pay  down  debts  and 
rebuild retirement savings. More recently, net migration has been higher. Most of these shifts 
are still playing out and haven’t settled into more predictable trends. 
To make forward-looking policy today in light of such uncertainties about tomorrow, tracking 
a broad range of indicators helps not just to give a picture of how the economy is evolving in 
real time but also to update, in a ‘Bayesian’ fashion, an assessment of prospects ahead. In 
this manner, being data driven isn’t akin to driving by looking in the rear-view mirror but more 
like adjusting your speed to the terrain ahead. 
Although different indicators will merit focus at different times, as I highlighted last summer, 
three types warrant particular attention at present:10 
1. 
The prospects for growth momentum in excess of trend consistent with eliminating 
spare capacity in the economy; 
Evidence of and expectations for a sustainable firming in domestic cost pressures; 
and 
Developments  in  core  inflation  consistent  with  a  reasonable  expectation  that  total 
CPI inflation will return to the target in around two years’ time. 
2. 
3. 
Progress in all three, both realised and prospective, will increase confidence that the initiation 
of limited and gradual rate increases will be consistent with returning inflation sustainably to 
the target. 
In this light, let me turn to recent developments. 
Momentum and slack 
After gaining momentum in 2013 and peaking around 3% in 2014, output growth has been 
steady during 2015, at rates close to 2%, a little below pre-crisis norms (Chart 5).11 
The average quarterly growth rate for 2015 of around 0.5% has disappointed compared to 
the MPC’s summer expectations of 0.7%. This shortfall reflects much weaker net trade, the 
absence of a rebound in housing activity, and less robust consumption growth. 
Nonetheless, private domestic demand is still solid, and household consumption has been 
resilient.  Consumption  growth  accelerated  to  3%  in  the  third  quarter  of  2015  (Chart  6), 
underpinned  by  the  strongest  real  income  growth  since  the  crisis  and  highest  consumer 
confidence in a decade. Excluding the understandable weakness in North Sea oil, business 
investment  grew  strongly  throughout  2015.  Surveys  suggest  investment  intentions  remain 
robust and, consistent with a stronger banking system, accommodative monetary policy, and 
very  supportive  credit  conditions.  Such  solid  private  domestic  demand  growth  can  be 
expected to continue. 
                                                 
10   See Carney (2015a). 
11   Moreover, recent revisions, lowered the level of output by around 0.3% in the third quarter of 2015 compared 
to the previous data vintage.

 The  same  cannot  be  said  of  the  global  economy,  which  has  slowed  even  relative  to  the 
MPC’s  modest  expectations  in  the  summer.  There  are  some  positives.  The  broadening  of 
euro-area  growth  has  offset  the  effects  of  a  moderation  in  US  growth  on  UK-weighted 
demand  (Chart  7).  In  addition,  to  the  extent  that  renewed  sharp  declines  in  oil  prices  are 
predominantly  supply  driven,  they  should  support  growth,  though  sustained  spillovers  to 
tightening financial conditions would mean to a lesser degree than usual. 
Since  August,  downside  risks  to  growth  in  emerging  market  economies  have  begun  to 
crystallise. This has triggered sharp drops in risky asset prices, rises in risk premia, and falls 
in the expected path for policy rates across advanced economies, including the UK. 
Further  downside  risks  to  the  global  outlook  remain,  reflecting  the  ongoing  challenges  in 
China, fragilities in other major emerging market economies, and the potential for financial 
contagion. Chinese trade has been strikingly weak recently, possibly reflecting rebalancing 
there, as softer investment reduces demand for imported capital goods. This process has hit 
advanced economy exports to China, particularly those from the UK which dropped by one 
third  in  the  year  to  November.  Global  difficulties  are  likely  to  continue  to  suppress  world 
demand  relative  to  our  expectations  in  August.  In  addition,  possible  spillovers  to  domestic 
demand via wealth and cost of capital channels bear close monitoring.

As one consideration in setting monetary policy, the MPC must evaluate how much of the 
moderation  in  output  growth  reflects  slower  supply  growth.  Slack  ultimately  matters  for 
inflationary pressures, though sizing it requires careful judgement, particularly after a supply 
shock.12 
A  simple  read  can  be  taken  from  the  unemployment  rate,  which  has  continued  its  solid 
downward  trend  since  the  autumn  of  2013,  falling  more  rapidly  than  we  had  expected  in 
August  and  its  historical  relationship  with  GDP  growth  would  have  suggested  (Chart  8). 
Short-term  unemployment  is  now  below  its  pre-crisis  average  rate,  though  longer-term 
unemployment  has  further  to  go  (Chart  9).13  In  addition,  the  vacancy  to  unemployment 
ratio – a simple measure of labour market tightness – is at its highest observed level since 
August 2005.

12   Sceptics  have  questioned  the  importance  of  slack  for  overall  price  pressures,  not  least  given  the  “missing 
disinflation” experienced in many advanced economies, including the UK, over the crisis. Various explanations 
have been put forward for this, including recently  by Simon Gilchrist and co-authors (2015),  who study the 
implications  of  financially  fragile  corporate  balance  sheets  for  pricing  dynamics.  The  UK’s  openness, 
moreover,  complicates  the  identification  of  the  price  Phillips  Curve  because  of  the  role  played  by  imported 
costs. Nonetheless, when these are accounted for, and with careful shock identification, a price Phillips Curve 
can  be  found.  See  e.g.  Burgess  et  al  (2013),  Greenslade,  Millard  and  Peacock  (2008),  and  Groen  and 
Mumtaz (2008). For further discussion see Carney (2015b).  
13   Recent Bank research has found a significant role for the long-term unemployment rate in wage determination 
in the United Kingdom, in contrast to the view that the long-term unemployed put little downward pressure on 
wage growth. See Speigner (2014).

 In the wake of the crisis, one reason that headline unemployment has not been a sufficient 
summary statistic for slack in the labour market is because of underemployment of those in 
work.  Employees  wanted  to  work  more  –  perhaps  to  make  up  for  lost  income.  This  gap 
between actual and desired hours widened significantly (Chart 10). Since the start of 2013, it 
has  been  closing  and  most  recently,  rather  sharply  so.  As  overall  employment  growth 
remains strong (Chart 11), this may reflect a normalisation of working patterns, with desired 
average hours returning to their pre-crisis level, rather than an unwelcome decline in labour 
demand. 
An  additional  source  of  labour  supply  is  net  migration,  which  has  recently  been  running 
above  past  averages.  This  is  likely  the  product  of  both  ‘pull’  and  ‘push’  factors:  many  UK 
firms report skills shortages which foreign workers can help to fill; while weak wage and 
employment  prospects  abroad  raises  foreign  workers’  willingness  to  migrate  to  the  UK. 
The implications for inflation are likely to be relatively small as migrants not only supply 
labour – raising supply – but also spend their incomes – raising demand.14 
                                                 
14   See the Box on page 30 of the May Inflation Report for estimates of the impact of alternative paths for labour 
supply. See Nickell and Saleheen (2015) for estimates of the impact of immigration on occupational wages.

On balance I read these labour market indicators as pointing to a further normalisation of the 
labour market and broadly consistent with our expectations last summer for a modest decline 
in slack. 
What could these developments mean for domestic cost pressures? 
12 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches
  Domestic cost pressures 
As  the  economy  continues  to  expand  and  slack  diminishes,  the  resulting  pressure  on 
resources would be expected to bid up wages.15 
Recently,  despite  falling  unemployment  and  the  MPC’s  expectations  in  the  summer,  wage 
growth  has  moderated  from  rates  around  3¼  %  to  around  2  ½  %  (Chart  12).  This  could 
reflect a range of influences, some of which are more relevant to the overall inflation outlook 
than  others.  For  example,  in  the  past  year,  there  is  likely  to  have  been  some  dampening 
effect on measured wage growth owing to changes in the composition of the workforce with 
more younger, less experienced workers entering employment.16 In addition, when measured 
on an hourly basis, the moderation in wage growth has been less marked, consistent with the 
fall back in average hours being a normalisation of working patterns. 
Nonetheless,  the  slowdown  in  wage  growth  gives  pause  to  the  inference  that  the  labour 
market is as tight as would be suggested by the drop in unemployment alone.

including during 2014, and moderation recently

 It  is  possible  that  the  rate  of  unemployment  at  which  the  economy  can  operate  without 
generating accelerating inflation is lower than previously thought, meaning less pressure on 
wage growth at any given jobless rate. This could be, for example, because job matching has 
become easier with new technologies or with greater labour mobility afforded by a recovery 
in  housing  market  liquidity.  Equally,  changes  to  unemployment  insurance  could  have 
encouraged  more  intensive  job  search  by  those  out  of  work.  Set  against  that,  analysis  by 
Bank  staff  suggests  a  decline  in  matching  efficiency  in  the  past  two  decades,  suggesting 
balanced risks to our assessment that merit continued monitoring. 
                                                 
15   This is the simple economics behind the Wage Philips Curve. Phillips (1958). For a modern interpretation see 
Gali (2011). 
16   These effects likely dragged on pay growth by around 1 percentage point last autumn. The implications of this 
for inflation are limited: because these workers also have lower average productivity, the net effect on firms’ 
unit costs is likely to be broadly neutral. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 13
  
 
A  final  possibility  is  that  the  moderation  in  wage  growth  reflects  the  low  headline  inflation 
rate. With widespread recognition that there is literally no inflation at present, bargaining over 
real pay is more straightforward. Indeed, there is some anecdotal evidence from the Bank’s 
Agents  that  slower  increases  in  households’  living  costs  have  been  a  significant  driver  of 
lower pay awards. A simple estimated Wage Phillips Curve suggests a similar conclusion.17 
If this is occurring, this will slow the build-up of cost pressures. The MPC must remain vigilant 
for signs that low inflation is having second-round effects in the wage bargain, possibly via 
inflation  expectations.  The  mechanical  return  to  higher  rates  of  inflation  as  past  falls  in 
energy prices begin to drop from the annual comparison should in time reverse this effect 
and  support  wage  gains.  More  fundamentally,  falling  joblessness  and  a  high  ratio  of 
vacancies  to  unemployment  should  support  wage  growth.  At  a  minimum,  such  dynamics 
suggest the need to continue to eliminate slack smartly. 
Of  course,  what  matters  for  inflation  is  not  wage  growth  in  isolation,  but  pay  relative  to 
productivity. Growth in output per worker has been around 1% recently and is likely to have 
fallen a little further towards the end of 2015.18 The result is that the levelling off in pay growth 
has had smaller implications for unit cost growth. In the third quarter of 2015, these grew at 
around 1½ to 2% on a range of measures, and seem likely to grow at rates a touch below 
what  we  expected  in  August.19  Stepping  back,  there  is  little  indication  of  accelerating  unit 
costs  we  had  expected.  And  certainly,  given  the  scale  of  foreign  disinflationary  pressures, 
current domestic cost growth is not yet consistent with a firming in underlying inflation. 
This brings me to the final set of factors, core inflation measures. 
Core inflation measures 
Around  one  third  of  the  inflation  basket  is  accounted  for  by  non-energy  imported  goods 
whose prices depend on their world prices and the sterling exchange rate. Measures of core 
inflation, which strip out the direct impact of volatile CPI items like energy and food prices, 
help  to  give  a  read  on  how  developments  in  these  variables  combine  with  domestic  cost 
pressures  to  drive  underlying  inflation  trends.  They  also  tend  to  give  a  sense  of  headline 
inflation  once  the  effects  from  volatile  items  drop  out  of  the  annual  comparison.20  Put 
differently, total CPI is more likely to move towards core than the reverse, suggesting, as a 
rule of thumb, that inflation is likely to pick up but not to overshoot core CPI a year ahead. 
                                                 
17   See Annex. 
18   Productivity measured in heads (i.e. output per worker) is relevant in computing unit cost growth using wage 
or labour compensation measures also expressed in per head terms. 
19   The Minutes of the MPC meeting held on 13th January 2016 noted that “In the year to 2015 Q3, a measure of 
total  unit  labour  costs  based  on  the  MPC’s  backcast  estimate  of  GDP  had  grown  by  1.6%.  Growth  of  unit 
wage costs had been somewhat stronger over the same period, at 2.3%, though both rates were likely to have 
eased back slightly in the fourth quarter of last year.” 
20   Analysis  by  Bank  staff  suggests  that  a  simple  principal  component  (PC)  measure  of  core  inflation  –  which 
summarises  the  broad  trends  contained  in  a  large  set  of  measures  –  is  a  better  predictor  of  subsequent 
headline inflation than is current headline inflation. In other words, gaps between core inflation and headline 
inflation tend, on average, to be resolved by total inflation moving back towards core inflation (rather than vice 
versa). However, although smaller, the root mean square error from core inflation-based forecasts for future 
inflation  does  not  seem  statistically  significantly  smaller  than  forecasts  using  current  headline  inflation. 
Additionally,  the  summary  PC  measure  of  core  inflation  forecasts  headline  inflation  1-year  ahead  more 
accurately than a simple assumption of 2%, such that core inflation provides useful information for near-term 
inflation trends.

 Measures of core inflation have been below 2% since the middle of 2014 (Chart 13), and 
weaker than projected in August. This mainly reflects weaker goods price inflation, which, in 
turn,  is  likely  the  product  of  sterling’s  past  appreciation  (Chart  14).21  Those  dynamics  will 
continue  to  weigh  on  core  inflation  for  a  while,  since  around  two-thirds  of  the  effects  of  a 
currency move are estimated to appear in CPI inflation at horizons beyond one year, making 
them relevant for monetary policy strategy.22 Of course, the recent weakness in sterling, if it 
persists, will moderate these effects somewhat. 
                                                 
21   Note  that  one  would  not  necessarily  expect  core  inflation  at  2%  with  CPI  inflation  at  target  if  the  items 
excluded from core inflation measures undergo persistent relative price shifts. For example, a “core” measure 
that relied exclusively on inflation in the services sector would have run above 2% in the pre-crisis era, when 
overall inflation was around 2%, in light of low inflation rates in goods prices. A “core” measure with a higher 
weight on goods prices would have shown the opposite. 
22   For example, although they are uncertain, estimates of the pass-through of exchange rate movements to CPI 
inflation suggest that, on average a 1% appreciation reduces consumer prices by around 0.3%. Those effects 
take time, though they are mostly complete in around three years – consistent with complete but gradual pass-
through of exchange rate changes to consumer prices. That likely reflects, among other things, rigidities in 
retailers’  pricing  decisions.  See  the  box  on  page  28  of  the  November  2015  Inflation  Report  for  further 
discussion.

 Conclusion 
The three factors I have described are guides to monetary policy decisions, but there are no 
magic thresholds.23 This journey doesn’t have a set timetable; only an expected direction of 
travel. 
In my opinion, we need to see cumulative progress in these three areas to have reasonable 
confidence  that  inflation  is  on  track  to  return  to  the  target  and  that  a  modest  tightening  in 
monetary policy will be necessary to ensure it does so sustainably. This means: sustained 
momentum relative to trend; domestic cost growth resuming a path consistent with headline 
inflation at 2%; and core inflation measures moving notably towards the target. 
It  is  clear  to  me  that,  since  last  summer,  progress  has  been  insufficient  along  these 
dimensions to warrant a tightening of monetary policy. The world is weaker and UK growth 
has slowed. Due to the oil price collapse, inflation has fallen further and will likely remain very 
low for longer. This may mean modestly weaker cost growth through this year, with the likely 
path for inflation, both headline and core, softer as a result. In short, recent developments 
suggest  that  the  firming  in  inflationary  pressure  we  had  expected  will  take  longer  to 
materialise. 
                                                 
23   In economic parlance, they are elements of a reaction function.  One can think of a reaction function as akin to 
guide  or  policy  rule  relating  the  policy  instrument  to  a  set  of  macroeconomic  variables.  These  are  usually 
evaluated with respect to an “objective function” containing the policymaker’s target variables. For example, a 
flexible  inflation  targeting  regime  would  be  consistent  with  an  objective  function  containing  the  deviation  of 
inflation from its target and the deviation of a measure or measures of real activity from their equilibrium levels, 
weighted according to the policymaker’s preferences for stabilising one at the cost of another. The reaction 
function approach is arguably more robust to uncertainty about the structure of the economy than alternatives 
that seek to characterise policy by the first-order conditions of the policymaker’s objective function, although 
that robustness comes at the cost of not being formally the ‘best’ rule for a given model structure. See for 
example Levin and Williams (2003).

It  has  always  been  the  case  that,  because  the  economy  is  subject  to  unforeseen 
disturbances,  the  precise  path  for  Bank  Rate  cannot  be  preordained.24  But  “data  driven” 
means  more  in  the  post-crisis  world.  The  economy’s  performance  will,  over  time,  reduce 
some  of  the  uncertainty  about  its  supply  side  and  underlying  inflation  dynamics.  Although 
great uncertainties remain, we are arguably better informed about the dynamics of exchange 
rate pass through, the prospects for some recovery in productivity growth and the resilience 
of the UK financial system. 
Risks  to  the  outlook  and  uncertainties  about  the  economy  are  occupational  hazards  of 
monetary  policy  making.  The  MPC’s  job  is  to  assess  them  constantly  and  set  policy 
accordingly. There will be no 
pre-commitments beyond an unwavering focus on conducting policy in a manner consistent 
with our remit. 
That means we’ll do the right thing at the right time on rates. 
Doing  the  right  thing  requires  taking  into  account  a  powerful  set  of  forces,  part  secular, 
cyclical, domestic, and global. These forces have kept interest rates depressed throughout 
the  recovery  and  into  the  expansion,  and  include  demographic  change,  slower  potential 
growth, higher credit spreads, lower desired investment and a lower relative price of capital, 
changes in income distribution, private deleveraging and lower public investment. 
Given  the  likely  persistence  of  these  forces,  our  expectation  is  that  the  path  for  the  real 
interest rate that balances demand and supply, will recover only gradually and to a limited 
extent compared to the pre-crisis era. 
The journey to monetary policy normalisation is still young. 
 
                                                  
24   There  are  potentially  multiple  interest  rate  paths  consistent  with  inflation  returning  to  target,  as  shown  in 
Broadbent (2015b). Of these, a policymaker’s preferred path would reflect their perception of the balance of 
risks, preferences over policy trade-offs, view of the transmission mechanism, and “model” of the economy.

  Annex: A simple Wage Phillips Curve 
(cid:2024)(cid:3047)(cid:3050)=(cid:2009)+(cid:2010)(cid:3050)(cid:2024)(cid:3047)(cid:2879)(cid:2869)(cid:3050) +(cid:2010)(cid:3006)(cid:3095)(cid:1831)(cid:3047)(cid:2024)(cid:3047)(cid:2878)(cid:3038)(cid:3043) +(cid:2010)(cid:3048)(cid:1873)(cid:3047)+(cid:2013)(cid:3047) 
A simple Wage Phillips Curve similar to Gali (2011) can be written as: 
where (cid:2009)  is  a  constant, (cid:2024)(cid:3047)(cid:3050)  is  nominal  wage  inflation, (cid:1831)(cid:3047)(cid:2024)(cid:3047)(cid:2878)(cid:3038)(cid:3043)   is  inflation  expectations  over 
some horizon (cid:1863), (cid:1873)(cid:3047) is the unemployment rate, which, in theory, enters relative to the natural 
rate  of  unemployment, (cid:1873)(cid:3047)∗.  This  is  unobserved  and  is  partly  captured  by  the  residual, (cid:2013)(cid:3047) 
(which also captures measurement error and other sources of unexplained variation in wage 
growth  such  as  compositional  effects).  The  presence  of  lagged  wage  inflation  allows  for 
some  degree  of  wage  indexation  or  inertia.  Because  wage  setting  is  forward  looking, 
expected future inflation enters as an explanatory variable. Finally, unemployment, relative to 
the natural rate of unemployment, enters as a measure of tightness in the labour market.25 
Quarterly growth in AWE private sector regular pay (annualised) is used as an explanatory 
variable. Unfortunately, this is only available from January 2000, so observations of quarterly 
average pay growth begin in 2000 Q2. The last observation is 2015 Q3. Unemployment is 
measured by the quarterly average of the LFS unemployment rate. Inflation expectations are 
measured  using  general  public  inflation  expectations  measures  taken  from  the  Barclays 
Basix index. 
Variations on this simple specification are also estimated. First, annual spot inflation, lagged 
one quarter, is used to replace the inflation expectations. That is on account of the strong 
collinearity between survey measures of household inflation expectations and actual inflation 
outturns.  Second,  the  Bank  of  England’s  agents’  scores  for  recruitment  difficulties  are 
included  as  an  additional  gauge  of  labour  market  frictions,  which could  reflect  the  ease  or 
otherwise  of  labour  market  matching,  and  which  are  not  captured  by  contemporaneous 
measures of headline unemployment. Third, productivity growth (in heads) is included as an 
additional explanatory variable. Table A1 contains the estimation results. 
The  model  in  column  (1)  of  the  table  contains  a  very  simple  Wage  Phillips  Curve  (WPC), 
relating  pay  to  its  lag  and  to  unemployment.  The  WPC  slope  of  around  unity  is  highly 
statistically significant and the simple model explains around 40% of the variation in wage 
growth. Column (2) adds lagged inflation as a crude measure of inflation expectations, and 
column  (3)  further  adds  the  recruitment  difficulties  measure.  Both  enter  with  the  expected 
sign and indicate that a 1 percentage point rise in inflation or a 1-point rise in the agents’ 
score  would  tend  to  correlate  with  rises  in  wage  growth  of  between  ½  and  ¾  percentage 
point. The coefficient on unemployment remains at around unity. 
Columns  (4)  and  (5)  add  measures  of  inflation  expectations.  Relative  to  (3),  the  inflation 
expectations measure in model (4) adds little explanatory power and enters with the “wrong” 
sign, possibly indicating multicollinearity. Dropping inflation, in column (5), restores a role for 
inflation  expectations  with  the  expected  sign.  Model  (5)  has  overall  marginally  less 
explanatory power than model (3). 
Columns (6) and (7) add productivity growth to the model. In moving from model (4) to (6), 
there is a small increment in explanatory power, and productivity growth enters significantly, 
although the coefficient on recruitment difficulties falls and is now estimated less precisely. 
Inflation expectations continue to enter with the “wrong” sign and their coefficient is estimated 
                                                 
25   In Gali’s model, unemployment is positive under flexible prices and wages on account of a steady state wage 
mark-up, which captures inefficiencies in wage setting. Unemployment can move away from this rate in the 
short run, during which period nominal wages and prices are rigid, in response to shocks to the economy.

imprecisely. Dropping these, in column (7), adds to the models adjusted explanatory power, 
which is taken as the “preferred” model.26

Using model (7) produces the fitted values for wage growth shown in Chart A1, from which 
the following narrative emerges. For much of the pre-crisis period, low unemployment and 
around-target  inflation  contributed  to  wage  growth  of  around  4%  (quarterly  annualised).  At 
the onset of the crisis, unemployment rose while recruitment difficulties and productivity fell, 
pushing down on wage growth. In the years that followed, above-target inflation supported 
nominal wage growth despite elevated labour market slack. Wage growth began to fall back 
around 2013–4, which is “unexplained” by the simple Wage Phillips Curve model, but which 
likely reflects positive shocks to labour supply, as emphasised by the MPC. Since then, wage 
growth  recovered  into  the  start  of  2015,  before  falling  back,  despite  lower  unemployment. 
Some of this fall back is interpreted by the model as reflecting the fall in inflation itself (green

bars disappear over 2015). In the most recent quarter, wage growth has fallen despite rising 
recruitment difficulties and falling unemployment, which appears as a negative residual in the 
model’s interpretation of the data.
