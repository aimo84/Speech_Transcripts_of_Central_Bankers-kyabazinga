Jens Thomsen: Brief overview of the Danish economy  
Statement by Mr Jens Thomsen, Member of the Board of Governors of the National Bank of Denmark, 
at the meeting of the Danish Economic Council, Copenhagen, 5 December 2006.  
 Developments  in  2006  reflect  extraordinarily  high  demand  in  the  Danish  economy.  The  growth  in 
demand will continue in 2007, but it is forecast that GDP growth will fall to approximately 2 per cent, 
leaving the rest of demand to be covered by net imports. This indicates that the Danish economy is 
close to its capacity limit. Higher wage increases are also expected. 
If  the  growth  in  demand  for  Danish  goods  exceeds  productivity  growth,  the  pressure  on  the  labour 
market will increase, unless the supply of labour is expanded. This labour requirement can hardly be 
met domestically, and it is difficult to judge how far sufficient resources can be provided from abroad.  
It is stated in line with Danmarks Nationalbank that even if the economy has become more flexible 
there is still a considerable risk of overheating. Such overheating will, as stated, lead to significantly 
higher  wage  increases,  and  thereby  an  extended  period  of  low  growth.  On  this  basis  Danmarks 
Nationalbank has recommended that demand be curtailed. The Economic Council also recommends a 
tightening of fiscal policy.
