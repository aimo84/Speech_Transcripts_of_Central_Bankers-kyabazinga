Svein Gjedrem: Inflation targeting - some theory with main focus on practice 
Speech  by  Mr  Svein  Gjedrem,  Governor  of  Norges  Bank  (Central  Bank  of  Norway),  given  at  the 
Centre for Monetary Economics/Norwegian School of Management, Oslo, 8 June 2004. 
The speech does not contain assessments of the economic situation or of current interest rate setting. 
 Norway has had an inflation target for monetary policy since March 2001. In my speech today, I will 
attempt to explain why and how an inflation targeting regime was introduced. 
In  a  number  of  countries,  including  Norway,  short-term  interest  rates  are  now  the  lowest  for 
generations. Let us look back to the views on monetary policy in Norway the last time interest rates 
were very low, in the postwar period up to the mid-1950s. As part of the measures taken in February 
1955, Norges Bank increased the discount rate, which had remained unchanged since the war, from 
2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent. In his annual address, central bank governor Erik Brofoss discussed this 
change:1
“In the longer run, the aim must be to bring interest rates down again. The outlook for achieving this is 
promising. Saving is high and can be supplemented by foreign capital. This provides the basis for a 
low interest rate if moderation is shown in relation to an expansionary urge.” 
In retrospect, we can safely say that the expansionary urge proved to be too strong. It took 50 years 
before the interest rate returned to this level, which we now regard as abnormally low. 
However, prevailing views on monetary policy at that time is probably of more interest. Brofoss said 
the following: 
“Increasing the discount rate will probably be widely regarded as the most important monetary policy 
measure.  The  interest  rate  is,  however,  a  controversial  instrument,  both  in  Norway  and  in  other 
countries. Nonetheless, an increasing number of countries use it. Whether the purported good results 
can  be  ascribed  solely  to  interest  rate  policy  is  another  question.  The  effects  in  Norway  may  differ 
somewhat from the effects in other countries. Countries with major currencies can influence short-term 
capital  movements  via  the  interest  rate.  This  is  only  possible  to  a  limited  extent  in  Norway.  A 
substantial share of business investment is self-financed and is not affected by the interest rate. The 
same applies to shipowners that finance new ships built in other countries with their foreign exchange 
earnings. As a cost factor, the interest rate will probably curb debt-financed investment. The question 
is  whether  this  will  eliminate  the  lowest  priority  investments.  In  the  long  run,  we  are  dependent  on 
long-term investment. Interest rate changes may therefore have adverse effects in Norway that do not 
occur in other countries.” 
This stands in contrast to the current view, as expressed by Norges Bank’s delegating authority, the 
Ministry of Finance:2
“The new guidelines for economic policy also imply that monetary policy has been given a clear role in 
stabilising  economic  developments.  This  means  that  the  scope  for  manoeuvre  in  monetary  policy 
should be used if the outlook for the economy changes.” 
In the 1950s and 1960s, a strong belief evolved that the economy could be controlled and steered in 
the desired direction. This optimistic view gradually lost favour in the face of developments. The way in 
which economic policy is oriented today reflects the experience gained and the lessons learned in the 
1970s and 1980s.3 Economic policy at that time was marked by coordination, control and regulation. 
Important elements were: 
• 
fiscal policy oriented towards full employment

The  use  of  price  regulation  was  particular  to  Norway.  The  following  description  is  by  Petter  Jakob 
Bjerve:4
“A characteristic of postwar Norwegian economic policy, compared with policies in other countries in 
the west, is that prices have largely been directly set by the authorities, while wages and other income 
have been determined by the market and by market organisations. With the high level of employment 
that the government sought to achieve in the 1970s, inflation was probably lower with price regulation 
than  it  would  have  been  without  it.  Nonetheless,  there  was  repeated  evidence  that  freezing  prices 
without freezing wages could not prevent a fairly sharp rise in prices. In 1978-1979, we witnessed a 
demonstration  of  the  extent  to  which  the  rise  in prices can  be  slowed,  at  least  temporarily,  when  a 
price freeze is combined with a wage freeze. But even this combination, which can only be temporary, 
cannot in the long run prevent a sharp rise in prices if the gap between demand and supply is too wide 
- as demonstrated by the rise in prices after 1980.” 
In  Norway,  the  efforts  to  develop  an  economy  under  strong  centralised  coordination  and  control 
culminated in the 1973 proposal to establish an incomes policy council.5 According to the proposal, the 
social partners would undertake a commitment through the council to keep negotiated wage increases 
within specific limits. It was also stipulated that demand management policy should be included as part 
of incomes policy. 
The proposal to establish an incomes policy council did not receive support. There was ultimately too 
much control and coordination. Now, only 30 years later, virtually nothing of this system remains. The 
structure was not solid enough. We know from experience that fiscal policy alone cannot ensure a high 
level of employment. The structure of the labour market and wage formation are probably of greater 
importance. The direct regulation of credit, interest rates and capital movements collapsed and was 
phased  out  in  the  1980s.  The  krone  is  floating.  Price  regulation  no  longer  plays  a  role  as  a 
macroeconomic instrument. The scope of business policy has become more general. State ownership 
in  the  Norwegian  business  sector  remains  extensive,  but  ownership  management  has  been 
reorganised  following  the  negative  experience  of  companies  in  Kongsberg,  Mo  i  Rana  and 
Syd-Varanger. 
The  economic  policy  of  the  1970s  and  1980s  contributed  to  wide  fluctuations  in  the  Norwegian 
economy. Economic developments were marked by high and variable inflation. Inflation rose gradually 
and it took a long time before it fell. The absence of a nominal anchor was one of the main reasons 
behind  the  pronounced  swings  in  the  Norwegian  economy.  With  a  policy  of  low  interest  rates  and 
devaluations, inflation took root. Nominal interest rates were kept at a low level even though inflation 
and the value of tax-deductible interest expenses rose. Frequent devaluations from 1976 were unable 
in the long term to prevent a decline in the manufacturing sector. On the contrary, they proved to be 
self-reinforcing.  The  wide  fluctuations  culminated  in  a  credit  boom  in  the  mid-1980s.  A  pronounced 
downturn and high unemployment followed at the end of the 1980s. 
I would like to highlight three factors that have taken on particular importance for economic policy in 
general, and monetary policy in particular. 
First,  economic  agents  look  to  the  future  when  they  make  decisions  about  consumption  and 
– 
investments, wages and prices, and take account of not only current economic policy, but also their

expecations of future economic policy. This is particularly evident in foreign exchange and financial 
markets, where exchange rates and interest rates are influenced when participants shift large amounts 
partly  on  the  basis  of  their  expectations  concerning  economic  policy  and  economic  developments. 
Financial market expectations concerning economic policy are entirely different today from what they 
were 20-30 years ago. Behaviour can change from being very rational to herd behaviour. The issues 
that receive attention, and that govern movements in exchange rates and interest rates, change. It is 
thus important that the authorities do not sow doubt, but on the contrary act in a predictable manner 
within a long-term framework. The authorities must be credible and inspire confidence. There must be 
consistency between the stated objectives of economic policy and what is actually done to achieve 
them.  This  is  the  most  important  reason  why  the  implementation  of  monetary  policy  has  been 
delegated  to  the  central  bank  in  Norway,  as  has  been  the  case  in  other  comparable  countries.  In 
Norway, the responsibility for interest rate decisions was delegated to Norges Bank through the 1985 
Norges Bank Act and through the application of the Act in 1986. 
Developments  in  economic  theory  have  also  had  considerable  influence  in  this  context.  Seminal 
studies on economic policy guidelines were conducted by Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott at the 
end of the 1970s.6 These studies are based on the assumption that economic agents do not make 
systematic errors in their assessments of what the authorities are planning for the future. The insights 
gained from these studies provide arguments in favour of ensuring the independence of the central 
bank  vis-à-vis  the  political  authorities,  and  of  defining  binding  monetary  policy  objectives.  Former 
governor of Norges Bank Hermod Skånland was particularly interested in this issue. Skånland stated 
the following as early as 1979:7
“What the central bank can do, on the other hand, is to use its professional judgment to conduct a 
policy  for  demand  management,  which  is  in  line  with  the  more  long-term  objectives  and  guiding 
principles that have been drawn up by the political authorities. This presupposes, however, that the 
central  bank  also  has  the  possibility  of  objecting  to  requests  from  the  same  authorities  when  their 
efforts to solve more short-term problems bring them into conflict with more long-term objectives.” 
– 
The  other  lesson  drawn  from  the  experience  of  the  1970s  and  1980s  was  that  it  was  not 
possible to reduce unemployment in the medium and long term by merely accepting somwhat higher 
inflation. Faced with the question of whether an increase in inflation from say 10 to 12 per cent was 
acceptable if stimulating the economy could at the same time reduce unemployment from say 2 to 1½ 
per  cent,  the  decision-making  authorities  would  most  likely  have  been  inclined  to  answer  yes.  But 
experience showed that this was not an available option. An attempt to increase output beyond the 
level  that  is  consistent  with  stable  inflation  will  over  time  lead  to  steadily  rising  inflation.  Economic 
agents will eventually incorporate higher inflation into their inflation expectations. In the long run, the 
result will only be higher inflation, not higher employment. Output and employment will return to their 
potential level. 
– 
The third factor is the special challenges to stabilisation policy posed by petroleum revenues. 
Norway’s  export  revenues  and  government  revenues  can  be  expected  to  be  very  high  as  long  as 
production  remains  high  and  as  long  as  the  global  market  allows  producing  countries  to  extract 
substantial  economic  rent.  At  the  same  time,  we  know  from  experience  that  revenues  may  vary 
sharply from year to year. As a result of the high level of earnings and fluctuations in these revenues, 
the  most  important  contribution  fiscal  policy  can  make  to  stabilising  the  Norwegian  economy  is  to 
provide a sound, long-term strategy for the use of petroleum revenues. Attempts to use the central 
government budget to fine-tune economic activity may have a destabilising effect if these attempts are 
perceived  as  a  breach  in  the  long-term  strategy  for  the  phasing  in  of  petroleum  revenues.  It  is 
necessary to show that fiscal policy is applied symmetrically in periods of economic expansion and 
contraction. 
From the mid-1980s, during and after the credit bubble, it was recognised that a substantial revision of 
economic  policy  would  be  necessary  and  that  the  problems  created  by  inflation  had  to  be  taken 
seriously. The exchange rate was chosen as the nominal anchor. Deteriorating competitiveness due to 
high wage growth would no longer be remedied by means of devaluations. Substantial emphasis was

placed  on  the  importance  of  wage  formation  for  developments  in  employment.  Only  when  wage 
growth  dropped  below  the  level  of  our  trading  partners  did  unemployment  begin  to  fall  and  the 
manufacturing  sector  began  to  pick  up.  Thus,  the  fixed  exchange  rate  policy  was  not  introduced  in 
order to strengthen the internationally exposed business sector in the short term. On the contrary, it 
was a breach in the approach whereby monetary policy and “exchange rate policy” had been oriented 
towards safeguarding these sectors. A fixed exchange rate was an intermediate target for achieving 
low and stable inflation. 
The alternative of inflation targeting was not developed in 1986, and adhering to the fixed exchange 
rate regime was probably the best available option. The report from the publicly appointed Steigum 
Commission, submitted in 1988, contains a very thorough discussion of the need for a credible long-
term policy, but also of the challenges involved in providing the economy with a nominal anchor after 
such a long period of high inflation:8
“Such a consistent exchange rate policy can yield better results in the long run than a strategy that is 
based  on  frequent  devaluations  or  downward  adjustments  of  the  krone.  This  applies  even  if  a 
devaluation, in isolation, has a favourable short-term impact on the real economy. The disadvantage is 
that devaluations tend to fuel expectations of further devaluations, which makes it difficult to break with 
this form of policy. As a result, inflation will be higher than in other countries while neither employment 
nor  economic  growth  will  be  systematically  higher.  On  the  contrary,  higher  inflation  will  most  likely 
have considerable negative effects on the real economy, partly because this will amplify the adverse 
effects of the tax regime. 
However, there may be considerable real economic costs associated with the transition to a consistent 
fixed exchange rate regime. It may take time for devaluation expectations to fade and for wage, price 
and interest rate developments to adapt fully to the exchange rate regime. The less credible a fixed 
exchange rate policy is at the outset, the longer it takes for devaluation expectations to fade, and the 
greater the transitional costs will be in connection with a regime change to a consistent fixed exchange 
rate policy.” 
This  analysis  shows  that  at  the  time  there  was  a  realistic  understanding  of  the  transitional  costs 
associated with bringing down inflation. 
Inflation fell gradually, down to 2-3 per cent in 1991-1992. If inflation targeting had been an available 
option in 1986, we might indeed have chosen to aim for just such a gradual fall in inflation. 
Economic policy had to be anchored more firmly after 15 years of short-term fine-tuning. We had not 
established  a  sufficiently  clear  institutional  framework  for  a  more  discretionary  monetary  policy.  We 
could not then assume that a floating krone exchange rate regime and the exercise of our professional 
judgment when setting interest rates would inspire confidence. 
We had to abandon the fixed exchange rate policy in 1992. An important reason was the weakness 
inherent  in  the  fixed  exchange  rate  regime  in  a  world  with  free  capital  flows  and  deep  financial 
markets.9 When the fixed exchange rate policy was formally abolished, the Norwegian economy again 
risked losing its nominal anchor. But the krone exchange rate showed little change to begin with and 
rapidly found a new range.

 The  exchange  rate  remained  stable  up  to  autumn  1996,  partly  because  wage  growth  was  low  and 
overall demand did not generate pressures in the economy. Gradually, the krone began to show wider 
fluctuations. The experience of the last half of the 1990s demonstrated that monetary policy cannot 
fine-tune the exchange rate. Developments in international financial markets led to more pronounced 
fluctuations.  And  more  fundamentally,  exchange  rate  developments  no  longer  provided  signals  to 
wage formation and fiscal policy when labour market pressures mounted and incomes policy failed. 
High  petroleum  revenues,  fiscal slippage  and  expectations  of  increased  use  of  petroleum  revenues 
contributed to this. Hence, the exchange rate was no longer appropriate as a nominal anchor. 
Norges Bank therefore placed increasing emphasis on low and stable inflation. A formal inflation target 
for monetary policy was introduced in the spring of 2001. The mandate for the conduct of monetary 
policy  is  provided  for  in  the  Regulation  on  Monetary  Policy,  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  on 
29 March 2001. The operational target of monetary policy as defined by the Government is inflation of 
close to 2.5 per cent over time. The idea of an inflation target for monetary policy was not new. This 
alternative for Norway was discussed in 1997 at the initiative of Norges Bank.10 Many countries had 
already gained many years’ experience in operating such a system. New Zealand was the first in line 
towards the end of the 1980s. Canada followed shortly thereafter. 
In New Zealand, the switch to inflation targeting was one component of a comprehensive public sector 
reform aimed at addressing incentive problems associated with economic policy. 
Canada, which is one of the industrial countries with the most experience of floating exchange rates, 
had been seeking a nominal anchor for some time. Towards the end of the 1980s, the central bank’s 
communication  increasingly  emphasised  price  stability  as  a  monetary  policy  objective.  An  inflation 
target was officially introduced at the initiative of the finance ministry and in a joint statement issued by 
the central bank and the finance ministry.11
Sweden introduced an inflation target in December 1992, inspired to some extent by the experience of 
Canada and New Zealand. After the deep economic crisis at the beginning of the 1990s, reverting to a 
fixed exchange rate policy was no longer deemed realistic. In this context, it must be added that the 
central bank of Sweden, when it was seeking to motivate and firmly establish inflation targeting during 
the 1990s, was able to draw on its own experience from the 1930s. Admittedly, Sweden did not have 
an  inflation  target  but  a  price  target  for  monetary  policy  in  the  period  1931-1937.  At  that  time,  the

concept  was  inspired  by  the  work  of  Knut  Wicksell  30  years  earlier.  As  early  as  in  1898,  Wicksell 
argued that price stability should be the central bank’s objective.12
After the collapse of the ERM in 1992, a gradual shift towards today’s system began in the UK, which 
translated into Chancellor Gordon Brown’s decision to transfer the authority to set interest rates from 
the Chancellor to a monetary policy committee at the Bank of England in 1997. 
Inflation  targeting  is  now  the  norm  in  small  and  medium-sized  open  economies.  Denmark  is  an 
important exception. Since the mid-1980s, Denmark has conducted a very disciplined fiscal and wage 
policy.  Combined  with  ERM  II  membership,  this  has  enabled  Denmark  to  maintain  a  credible  and 
successful fixed exchange rate regime. 
The new monetary policy system that has gained international support has essentially been developed 
in concert by finance ministries and central banks, and through experience and practical application. 
Inflation targeting is not a static system, but a system that is challenged by both reality and academia. 
Subsequent economic literature has followed up where Knut Wicksell left off, and partly supports and 
partly questions central bank policy. 
More recent monetary policy theory is frequently based on a loss function, or a preference function, 
which  includes  explicit  targets  for  both  inflation  and  output.  Stabilising  output  is  taken  into account, 
thus recognising that monetary policy has an impact on the real economy in the short to medium term. 
It  is  the  central  bank’s  task  to  choose  an  interest  rate  path  that  strikes  the  best  possible  balance 
between low and stable inflation and stable developments in the real economy over time. 
Ragnar Frisch was pursuing a similar line of thinking. Frisch wanted to construct a quantitative form of 
a  preference  function  that  could  be  applied  in  practical  policy.  Frisch  delved  into  the  matter.  For 
example, he devoted considerable time to interviewing politicians to identify the “true” welfare function. 
His approach involved three phases. As to the first phase, Frisch stated:13
“...the econometrician uses his general knowledge of the political atmosphere in the country ... He will 
then be able to form a temporary perception of the quantitative form of the preference function”. 
In the next phase, the preferences are identified by means of a system for interviewing politicians: 
“This interview system must be designed so that the results, without the politicians necessarily having 
to  understand  this,  can  draw  certain  conclusions  as  to  the  numerical  nature  of  the  preference 
function.” 
In the third and last phase, the information derived from the interviews is combined with the data on 
the structure of the economy and the formulated preference function. 
“This will yield a solution in the form of an optimal path for economic and social development.” 
Professor Lars Svensson, one of the most prominent contemporary academics in the field of monetary 
policy, expresses thoughts similar to those of Frisch. Svensson recommends the following:14
“...inflation targeting central banks should announce (an) explicit loss function with numerical weights 
on output-gap stabilization... Simple voting procedures for forming the Monetary Policy Committee’s 
aggregate loss function... are suggested.” 
A practical approach, which is probably pursued by most central banks, is to produce projections for 
the  economy  based  on  different,  possible  interest  rate  paths.  Decision-makers  can  then  strike  a 
balance between the various considerations and make decisions based on these projections.15

Both  the  formulation  of  a  precise  inflation  target  and  the  aim  of  striking  a  balance  between  the 
objectives of stable output and inflation could invite a repeat of earlier attempts at fine-tuning. But here 
it is important to adhere to the lessons drawn from the 1970s and 1980s. The uncertainty underlying 
the decisions taken must not be underestimated. There is uncertainty as to the current state of the 
economy,  the  underlying  driving  forces  and  the  economy’s  functioning,  including  expectations 
formation and the impact of monetary policy. 
Economic models are tools that help us address some of this uncertainty. Inflation targeting places 
new  demands  on  our  models  and  our  use  of  models.  In  an  uncertain  world,  risk  analysis  is  a  very 
important  part  of  the  work.  The  aim  is  as  much  to  understand  the  economics  of  the  forecast  as  to 
produce quantitative estimates. In central banks, dramatic developments in macroeconomic modelling 
have  taken  place  over  the  past  10  years.  At  Norges  Bank,  we  have  started  work  on  developing 
modelling tools for inflation targeting. We are inspired by and work closely with other central banks and 
the IMF and draw on our long experience of model building in Norway. We are working on several 
different  models  and  we  are  assessing  other  building  blocks  that  we  need  to  support  our  work  in 
setting interest rates under an inflation targeting regime. 
Part of the work involves developing a fairly small model that can serve as a reference and a basis for 
discussions  and  deliberations  within  the  Bank  and  the  Executive  Board.  The  thinking  behind  this  is 
that  this  model  will  contribute  to  disciplining  and  structuring  discussions  and  to  consistent 
argumentation across issues and over time. Moreover, this model could serve as an aid in our external 
communication on monetary policy and our view of the functioning of the economy. The model must 
satisfy the following requirements: 
The model must have a well defined equilibrium 
1. 
The model must be predicated on the experience gained in the 1970s and 1980s, which showed that 
we cannot increase employment in the long run by accepting higher inflation. In the long run, inflation 
is a monetary phenomenon. 
Inflation expectations must be modelled explicitly 
2. 
We must have a line of reasoning and a model that takes account of the forward-looking behaviour of 
economic agents when making decisions. Agents take account not only of today’s economy policy, but 
their expectations as to future economic policy. As mentioned, it may be difficult to form a perception 
of  how  expectations  are  formed.  An  advantage  of  modelling  expectations  explicitly  is  that  we  can 
analyse the effects of different views on how they are formed. 
Monetary policy must have a defined role in the model 
3. 
The model must address monetary policy’s main task: providing a nominal anchor. 
The model must be transparent and manageable 
4. 
Norges  Bank’s  administration,  management  and  Executive  Board  must  be  able  to  interpret  and 
understand the model. It must not be perceived as a black box. It must have a theoretical structure so 
that we can easily examine the effects of alternative views of the economy’s functioning. 
The model must reflect the Bank’s view 
5. 
As a result of the modelling work, the Bank’s views on relationships in the economy will evolve. At the 
same time, we are developing a model with relationships that we have confidence in. 
Models will never provide us with a definitive answer. A model will always represent a simplification of 
reality. We must be pragmatic and exercise a good measure of judgement in addition. In my view, the 
most  important  role  of  models  is  to  provide  a  framework  and  structure  for  the  decision-making 
process, and to ensure that we do not change our views on the functioning of the economy without 
thorough reflection.

The use of models must also be seen in connection with the uncertainty associated with the actual 
state  of  the  economy  and  the  driving  forces  that  dominate  at  a  given  point  in  time.  It  can  be  a 
demanding task in itself to find the balance between incorporating new information on the one hand 
and making abstraction of pure noise on the other. Allow me to illustrate.

 The  chart shows  quarterly  changes  in mainland  GDP,  adjusted  for  seasonal  variations.  The  figures 
show wide quarterly variations. It is uncertain whether this reflects fundamental conditions or statistical 
noise.  Norway  is  a  small  economy,  and  extraordinary  events  can  have  a  substantial  impact  on 
aggregate figures.

These figures nonetheless fluctuate considerably less for Sweden and the UK. I will not comment on 
whether the differences are real or merely statistical. Let us now contrast these quarterly figures with 
our  output-gap  estimates  using  annualised  figures.16  This  estimation  may  provide  a  basis  for 
assessing the contours of cyclical developments.

 We must not and cannot fine-tune economic developments. We must therefore exercise caution in our 
use of short-term statistics and quarterly figures. Changes in these figures may represent more noise 
than news. The challenge facing us is to identify the contours of cyclical developments.

Allow me to conclude. 
Today’s monetary policy is based on the experience gained by Norway and other countries, over the 
past  30  years  in  particular,  and  on  the  results  of  extensive  macroeconomic  research.  Important 
lessons are: 
– 
Inflation is a monetary phenomenon. A country with a national currency can choose the level 
of  its  own  inflation.  Inflation  in  a country  is  not something  that  drifts  in  with  the  wind  from 
abroad. 
If monetary policy is to function effectively, an institutional framework is required to reinforce 
confidence that overriding weight is assigned to long-term objectives. 
 The institutional framework and guidelines for monetary policy in Norway reflect developments in other 
countries. This is of particular importance for a small country because of the considerable influence 
international operators have on developments in our country. Rules can anchor expectations, but they 
must be credible and robust to disturbances to international and domestic economic developments. 
Inflation  targeting  is  in  practice  a  flexible  rule  that  can  stabilise  expectations  and  at  the  same  time 
provide room for adapting to the abrupt shifts our economy is exposed to. 
Thank you for your attention.
