Jean-Pierre Roth: Rising oil prices – a challenge for monetary policy? 
Speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Swiss  National  Bank, 
Déjeuners de la Finance, Geneva, 2 November 2005. 
The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 Despite  oil  prices  being  at  a  historically  high  level,  inflation  has  increased  only  slightly  in  recent 
quarters and growth appears to be robust. Are we to assume, therefore, that oil no longer plays an 
important role in today’s economic environment? What challenges does the current situation pose for 
monetary policy?  
For the first time, the steady rise in energy prices is not the result of a political boycott by oil-producing 
countries,  but  of  an  increase  in  energy  demand,  coming  in  particular  from  the  newly  industrialised 
countries in Asia. In other words, the rise in crude oil prices this time can be attributed to the strong 
growth in global economic activity.  
This does not mean, however, that the role of monetary policy has changed. Although core inflation 
currently  appears  to  be  under  control  in  most  countries,  a  persistent  and  continuous  rise  in  energy 
costs  could  have  an  effect  on  all  prices  and  wages  in  the  long  run,  thereby  jeopardising  monetary 
stability. Notwithstanding the low level of inflation (excluding energy prices), it is vital that the monetary 
authorities maintain a forward-looking stance so as not to put their credibility on the line and to ensure 
long-term price stability.
