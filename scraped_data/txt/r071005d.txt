Barbro Wickman-Parak: The Riksbank and monetary policy – 
perspectives on interest rate forecasts  
Speech  by  Ms  Barbro  Wickman-Parak,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  a 
Statistics Sweden seminar, Stockholm, 3 October 2007. 
 Thank  you  for  inviting me  to  this seminar.  Economic  forecasts  have  long  been  my  special 
field and this of course plays an important role in my job at the Riksbank. But as you know, 
the Riksbank’s communication policy means that we do not usually send any signals on how 
we intend to act with regard to changes in the policy rate at the next meeting. This limits the 
possibilities for me to actively participate in a discussion of the most recent yield of statistics, 
which is the theme of this meeting. So the view of the economic situation I intend to present 
in brief today applies to my assessment at the time of the monetary policy meeting held in 
September. I shall instead take the opportunity to say a few words about our experiences so 
far of the Riksbank’s publication of its own forecast for the repo rate. What lessons can we 
learn? 
The monetary policy decision on 6 September 
In September we Executive Board members decided to raise the repo rate from 3.50 to 3.75 
per cent. I supported both the raise in the interest rate and the assessment that the repo rate 
should  be  raised  further  at  around  the  pace  we  presented  in  June.  My  motives  for  the 
decision are expressed in more detail in the minutes from the meeting, so I shall not say very 
much on this point. 
The  statistics  received  regarding  developments  in  Sweden  during  the  second  quarter 
showed a slightly tighter labour market than we expected in June and unemployment was 
slightly lower than we were predicting (Figure 1). The hiring plans according to the National 
Institute  of  Economic  Research’s  business  tendency  survey  for  July  also  indicated  that 
employment would continue to rise during the third quarter. 
At the same time, labour shortages in the business sector had continued to increase (Figure 
2).  I  therefore  repeated  by  view  from  June,  namely  that  companies  could  be  forced  to 
increase their remunerations to obtain skilled labour. This could push up wage increases. If 
companies  instead  choose  to  lower  their  requirements  regarding  qualifications  this  could 
have  an  effect  on  productivity  growth  which  would  then  risk  being  weaker  than  the 
development we envisaged. In both cases cost and inflationary pressures rise. 
According to the preliminary National Accounts, which were published in August, productivity 
showed much weaker development during the second quarter than we had predicted in June 
(Figure  3).  But  even  if  there  was  reason  to  believe  that  it  would  be  short-lived,  there  is 
nevertheless considerable uncertainty regarding how productivity will develop in the future. 
And inflation, what has happened there? It had only been slightly higher than the forecast in 
June  (Figure  4).  However,  companies’  costs  had  increased  more  rapidly  than  expected 
(Figure  5).  We  also  saw  that  commodity  prices  had  risen,  as  had  food  prices  (Figure  6). 
Business tendency data from the National Institute of Economic Research also indicated that 
food  prices  would  continue  to  rise.  Inflation  expectations,  which  normally  fluctuate  fairly 
substantially, had also shown a weak trend increase since summer 2005 and were at around 
2.5  per  cent  for  households  in  August,  according  to  the  National  Institute  of  Economic 
Research’s survey (Figure 7). 
House prices had also continued to rise over the summer, while household borrowing had 
continued to increase at roughly the same rate as during the first quarter.

To summarise, there were in my view strong domestic reasons for raising the repo rate to 
3.75 per cent in September. This could in itself also have justified a slightly higher forecast 
for  the  repo  rate.  But  there  was  a  counteracting  effect  from  developments  in  the  United 
States and the unrest on the financial markets. My conclusion was therefore that the repo 
rate forecast from June provided a fairly good picture of the most likely path for the repo rate 
over the coming years. If it were the case that the US economy suffered a deep recession 
with severe contagion effects, the Riksbank would have reason to reconsider its views. 
Advantages of an own interest rate forecast 
This leads me on to our experiences so far of the Riksbank’s publishing its own forecast for 
the  repo  rate.  Since  the  inflation  target  was  introduced,  the  Riksbank  has  tried  in  different 
ways to become ever more open and clear with regard to how monetary policy is conducted. 
More and more information on the bases for the decisions has been published, not least the 
forecasts for inflation and the economy as a whole. I think that the decision to publish our 
own forecast for the repo rate was a natural continuation of this process. 
One should also bear in mind that the Riksbank must in any case make an assumption about 
the interest rate as a basis for its forecasts regarding growth and inflation. To begin with, an 
unchanged policy rate was used in the forecasts. This method had the advantage of making 
it  easy  to  explain  that  the  interest  rate  needed  to  be  raised  or  cut,  but  it  also  involved  an 
unrealistic forecast. The interest rate does not normally remain unchanged during a forecast 
period of a couple of years. 
After  this  the  Riksbank  changed  over  to  using  implied  forward  rates  as  a  base  for  its 
forecasts. One problem is that these interest rates do not unambiguously reflect expectations 
of  the  repo  rate,  as  they  also  contain  risk  premiums  that  may  vary  over  time.  Although 
adjustments were made for this, there was another type of problem with using forward rates. 
If  market  agents’  expectations  differ  from  the  Riksbank’s  view,  it  is  problematic  if  forward 
rates are nevertheless used as a base for the forecasts. Using one’s own forecast is much 
more transparent and direct. 
In February the Riksbank introduced a new system which means that we publish a forecast 
for the repo rate together with a probability distribution. Previously the interest rate path has 
only  been  published  in  connection  with  the  Monetary  Policy  Reports  issued  three  times  a 
year. But in September the Executive Board took the decision that the interest rate path and 
forecasts for certain key variables should also be published at the monetary policy meetings 
where no report was published. 
There are several advantages to the Riksbank publishing its own interest rate forecast. We 
can then explain more clearly to the general public and market agents how we view future 
interest  rate  developments,  which  makes  it  easier  to  evaluate  monetary  policy.  Clearer 
communication should also mean that monetary policy becomes more efficient. Through the 
influence  on  interest  rate  expectations  the  Riksbank  can  to  a  greater  degree  influence 
interest rate setting in the economy. 
Another  advantage  of  having  our  own  interest  rate  forecast  is  that  it  becomes  simpler  to 
explain  how  we  view  the  driving  forces  behind  economic  developments  and  also  the 
objective  and  effects  of  monetary  policy.  At  the  same  time,  it  should  contribute  to  giving 
greater depth to the analyses and discussions of monetary policy conducted both within and 
outside of the Riksbank. 
Up to February this year, when I myself still worked as an analyst, I like many others tried to 
interpret the Riksbank’s communication and what it might mean for future interest rates. The 
combination of the Riksbank now publishing its own interest rate forecast and at the same 
time continuing to report how we think has the potential to change the discussion outside of 
the  Bank.  It  could  to  a  greater  extent  concern  how  new  information  should  affect 
2 
 BIS Review 111/2007
expectations of interest rate developments rather than exactly what formulations are used in 
for example speeches and press releases.  
Interest rates are by definition always uncertain 
Let me take up some issues that are important to keep in mind when formulating forecasts 
for the repo rate. 
Firstly, the interest rate path we present is a forecast and forecasts are, as we know, very 
uncertain.  To  illustrate  this,  the  Riksbank  publishes  uncertainty  intervals,  known  as  fan 
charts, around its interest rate forecasts and also its inflation and GDP forecasts (Figure 8). 
As  you  see,  the  uncertainty  interval  increases  considerably  in  relation  to  the  length  of  the 
time horizon. Put simply, the probability of unexpected shocks arising in the economy that 
would lead to developments deviating from the forecasts increases when the time horizon is 
longer. 
In other words, it is not easy to make accurate forecasts of the development of the interest 
rate in the longer term. One means of illustrating this is to see how the implied forward rates 
have changed over time. Figure 9 shows implied forward rates measured on a quarterly rate. 
Expectations of the development of the repo rate have varied substantially over time when 
measured in this way. During the years the interest rate has gradually been cut, expectations 
according to implied forward rates have substantially overestimated the level of the repo rate. 
After  the  interest  rate  raises  began  one  and  a  half  years  ago,  there  has  rather  been  a 
tendency for the repo rate path to be slightly underestimated. 
As  the  economy  is  constantly  exposed  to  unexpected  shocks,  it  is  not  at  all  strange  that 
forecasters revise their assessments. This applies to the major banks, the National Institute 
of  Economic  Research,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  also  to  us  at  the  Riksbank  and  our 
interest  rate  forecasts.  The  major  uncertainty  means  that  we  forecasters  should  be  very 
cautious  when  making  statements  about  the  future,  but  this  should  not  restrain  us  from 
saying how we think the future will look. 
Secondly, it is difficult to determine what will be a normal level for the interest rate a couple of 
years ahead, that is, the interest rate that prevails in a normal phase of the business cycle. 
As we can see in the diagram, the paths for forward rates have flattened out and the view of 
what  is  a  normal  rate  has  gradually  been  revised  downwards  over  time  (Figure  9).  The 
Riksbank  has  stated  that  a  normal  level  for  the  repo  rate  is  probably  somewhere  in  the 
interval  3.5  to  5  per  cent.  But  experiences  show  that  the  repo  rate  can  lie  outside  of  this 
rather broad range for fairly long periods of time. 
Lively discussions after publication of the interest rate path 
There have been lively discussions on both occasions when the Riksbank has published an 
interest rate path. It is good that our forecasts and assessments are discussed. The fact that 
the Riksbank gives its view of the interest rate over a longer time span encourages this – the 
longer the time perspective, the greater the scope for differences in assessments. But the 
discussion  that  has  arisen  has  often  not  taken  this  direction;  instead  it  has  focussed  on 
market agents having been taken by surprise by the Riksbank. 
This is, of course, not the desired effect. The Riksbank aims to be predictable and from this 
aspect the experiences so far of publishing our own interest rate forecast have been not only 
positive. My view is that we are at the beginning of a joint learning process. It is unusual for 
the Riksbank to communicate its own interest rate path and it is unusual for market agents to 
relate to it. This is something that both parties will become better at as our experience in this 
field  increases.  We  can  also  make  some  comparisons  with  when  the  Riksbank  began  to 
publish its inflation forecast. When the forecast was changed this sometimes led to a debate. 
BIS Review 111/2007

But after a time, everyone became used to the idea that the inflation path would be revised, 
and it will probably be the same case with the interest rate path. 
Was the adjustment of the interest rate path in June extreme? 
Here  I  intend  to  focus  primarily  on  the  reactions  in  the  financial  markets  following  the 
monetary policy meeting in June. As you will remember, the Riksbank at that time presented 
a new forecast for the repo rate. The forecast was on average 50 points above the earlier 
forecast  that  we  published  in  our  February  report.  We  were  then  criticised  because  our 
revision of the repo rate forecast was greater than one would normally expect during such a 
short period of time. 
One observation is that while the revision was large, it was not in any way extreme. If one 
analyses how the implied forward rates are revised, one can see that the probability of these 
being  revised  to  a  greater  degree  than  the  Riksbank's  revision  of  the  repo  rate  forecast 
between the February and June reports is approximately 20-25 per cent. This means that on 
every  fourth  or  fifth  occasion  the  market  expectations  have  been  revised  more  than  the 
Riksbank’s revision in June. 
What had the market agents expected? 
Another  question  is  how  the  market  agents’  expectations  of  interest  rate  developments 
changed after we had published our forecast in June. 
Figure 10 shows the expectations of monetary policy that can be understood from the implied 
forward rates. The day prior to the decision the implied forward rates indicated that market 
agents had prices a level for the repo rate of 4.0 per cent during the first quarter of 2008, that 
is, around the same as the main scenario later published by the Riksbank. In the longer term 
the Riksbank’s main scenario and implied forward rates differed. With effect from the middle 
of 2008 onwards, implied forward rates were above the new interest rate path published by 
the Riksbank. The market information the commercial banks sent to their customers showed 
a similar picture. One can not, therefore, say that the Riksbank’s June forecast on the whole 
contained abnormally large interest rate increases. 
Why were the market reactions so strong? 
Both the market information and pricing in the market thus indicated that analysts if anything 
were counting on a higher repo rate in the longer term than the forecast later published by 
the  Riksbank.  Nevertheless,  the  yield  curve  for  implied  forward  rates  rose  by  around  15 
points  over  the  entire  period  following  the  interest  rate  announcement  on  20  June  (see 
Figure 10). 
Why were the market reactions so strong? Firstly, international interest rates rose that day, 
which probably reinforced the rise in Sweden. Secondly, there are many signs that market 
agents had expected the Riksbank to publish an interest rate path that was lower than the 
path  it  actually  published.  So  despite  the  market  analysts’  own  interest  rate  expectations 
being in line with the Riksbank’s published interest rate path for the coming six months and 
higher further ahead, they were surprised by the Riksbank’s upward revision of the interest 
rate path. 
One might ask why market agents’ expectations of the Riksbank’s interest rate path differed 
from their own forecasts for the repo rate. One interpretation is that they believed they had 
weighed together information on inflationary pressures in the economy in a different way than 
the Riksbank. This is nothing strange in itself. Assessing economic developments is not an 
exact science and different forecasters may very well draw different conclusions regarding 
the  underlying  inflationary  pressure  in  the  economy.  But  what  surprises  me,  if  this  is  the 
4 
 BIS Review 111/2007
correct interpretation, is that the market nevertheless reacted so strongly to the assessment 
we made in June. 
Another  interpretation  might  be  that  some  analysts  thought  the  Riksbank’s  assessment  of 
inflation  prospects  and  interest  rate  development  did  not  differ  significantly  from  their  own 
assessments, but that the Riksbank did not want to revise the interest rate forecast made in 
February by that much, for reasons of prestige. I do not know whether this could have been 
part of the explanation, but I believe and hope that it was not. We Executive Board members 
have always been careful to point out that the interest rate path we publish is a forecast, and 
like  other  forecasts  is  reconsidered  each  time  we  make  a  decision.  If  our  analysis  of  the 
prospects for production and inflation shows that our repo rate path needs to be revised in a 
particular way so that monetary policy is well balanced, then we will do this. 
What lessons can we learn? 
So far we have only limited experience of the new system and it is difficult to draw any far-
reaching conclusions. But perhaps we can learn some lessons for the future already at this 
stage. To begin with, it is important to note that, apart from the differences between different 
market  agents’  expectations,  there  may  also  be  differences  between  market  agents’  own 
forecasts  for  the  repo  rate  and  their  forecasts  for  the  interest  rate  path  the  Riksbank  will 
publish. It will be important for us to analyse what these differences are due to and how they 
should be interpreted in order to be able to predict the reactions at the times of the interest 
rate decisions. It is also important that we should constantly strive to become clearer in our 
communication to avoid it being interpreted in a way we did not intend. The decision to begin 
publishing interest rate forecasts in connection with each monetary policy meeting should be 
regarded in this context. 
There are some indications that certain market analysts interpreted a couple of speeches by 
Executive Board members during the spring in a way that was not intended. They appear to 
have  drawn  the  conclusion  that  the  interest  rate  path  would  be  revised  upwards  less  than 
had  been  assumed  previously.  The  reasons  for  this  could  be  a  combination  of  unclear 
communication on our part and a willingness among some market agents to read too much 
into  what  was  actually  said.  The  more  our  new  policy  of  not  signalling  between  monetary 
policy meetings becomes established, the better the communication will work. We Executive 
Board members will of course assess new information continuously and have instantaneous 
opinions on where we are heading. All those who make forecasts know that one’s opinion of 
how the future will look like varies over time. But one day one must put one's foot down. It is 
mainly the result of this sometimes convoluted process that is the interesting factor, although 
the  journey  also  has  some  information  value.  For  us  Executive  Board  members  each 
monetary policy meeting is the final point of one such process and it is not until then that we 
make our collective assessment. 
Thank you!
