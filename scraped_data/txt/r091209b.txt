Njuguna Ndung’u: The African economic picture and the Kenyan 
economy after the crisis 
Notes by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, at an address to 
the Emerging Market Traders’ Association, Nairobi, 20 November 2009. 
 General Africa’s macroeconomic overview 
After a decade of strong performance in Africa’s economies, the global economic crisis has 
dented its growth path  
• 
Economic  growth  in  SSA  has  fallen  from  an  average  of  6.5%  in  the  2005–2007 
period to 1.1% in 2009 (from a projected growth of 6.2%)  
Exports have fallen from an average of 37.7% of GDP in 2005–2007 period to 31% 
in 2009 with reduced demand 
The economic crisis has dampened the expectations on commodity futures markets 
thereby inducing falling prices and demand for most commodities 
Falling export demand/declining commodity prices spread the impact of the crisis to 
far  more  SSA  countries;  suppressing  economic  activity  and  causing  fiscal  and 
external balances to deteriorate significantly 
Africa’s  oil  exporters  and  middle  income  countries  have  been  hard  hit  when 
compared  to  their  low-income  counterparts  while  the  fall  in  copper  and  diamond 
prices has resulted in a significant drop of export receipts for Zambia and Botswana, 
respectively 
Most of these countries had extensively built some fiscal space before the crisis – 
this has suffered severely 
Current  account  balance  has  worsened  with  a  significant  drop  in  exports  as 
compared to imports 
Economic effects of the crisis on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) 
• 
What  emerged  about  16  months  ago  as  a  global  financial  crisis  turned  into  the 
sharpest global economic contraction in modern times. Its negative effects on Sub-
Saharan Africa are still unfolding 
The crisis initially hit African countries with stronger financial linkages to international 
capital markets; significant trade relations with the Western world and  rich natural 
resource countries 
The  initial  phase  of  the  crisis  manifested  itself  through  weakening  of  local 
currencies, declining foreign reserves and bubble busts in capital markets  
Declining foreign reserves 
–  Decline in demand leading to significant drop in commodity prices and worsening 
terms of trade in general 
–  Non-resident outflows from equity and bond markets (“flight to safety”) 
–  The market-determined or flexible exchange rate acted as an automatic stabilizer 
during  this  crisis  in  most  African  economies  and  accumulated  reserves  were 
drawn down to cushion the economies 
BIS Review 159/2009

          Weakening of stock markets as a result of 
–  Outflow of non-residents’ funds – dumped stocks 
–  Unfavorable investor sentiments: concerns about global recession and negative 
impact on domestic economies 
Impact of the crisis differs across countries and regions – growth

How has Africa responded to the crisis? 
• 
• 
reserves  holdings  allowed 
Foreign exchange rates allowed to depreciate freely to absorb the dollar pressure 
Foreign  exchange 
depreciation pressure  
Most  central  banks  have  reduced  policy  rates  to  signal  easing  monetary  policy. 
Increased  liquidity  is  expected  to  ensure  availability  of  funds  to  finance  economic 
activities 
Fiscal stimuli: most countries have used countercyclical budget policies to jump-start 
economic activities 
to  decline  absorbing  dollar 
What is happening on the ground in Africa? 
• 
• 
Slow economic recovery 
Unemployment still rising (youth unemployment – social strife in some African cities) 
as companies in real sector still shedding jobs 
Entering international capital markets via sovereign bonds has been postponed to a 
later  date  when  economic  performance  at  the  global  level  improves  –  postponed 
infrastructure projects 
Inflationary  pressures  have  eased  in  most  SSA  economies  but  the  challenge  is 
being compounded by weather conditions that have seen a rise in food prices 
Excess capacity exists in export industries across sectors 
Drop in immigrant remittances which has become a key source of finance 
Penetration  of  China  and  India  to  African  region  at  a  period  when  the  western 
countries  are  at  their  weak  economic  position  –  changing  trade  and  FDI  flows 
(China has pledged US$10 billion in economic cooperation with Africa) 
Key banks in the business of lending, which fuels investment and job creation, are 
not yet lending at pre-crisis levels, as such hurting the economy as a whole 
Banks  remain  reluctant  to  lend,  and  tight  credit  especially  for  small  businesses, 
stands in the way of the strong recovery we need – but more driven by slowdown of 
economic activity 
Government borrowing has increased and it will be important that this crowds-in the 
private sector with the amounts borrowed going to production activities – the best as 
we have seen are the infrastructure bonds 
Ongoing  efforts 
convergence criteria – ESF 
level  or  regional 
foreign  reserves 
to  pre-crisis 
to  re-build

Prospects for Africa in the post crisis period 
• 
Africa’s  prospects  in  the  post-crisis  period  is  contingent  on  the  behavior  of 
policymakers both in Treasury and central banks 
The  first  issue  at  the  moment  in  most  countries  is  to  do  as  much  as  possible  to 
support economic recovery through job creation and protect the wage good 
Fiscal policy in post-crisis Africa  
–  Sustaining domestic demand in the post-crisis period critical  
–  Countercyclical  fiscal  policy  to  sustain  demand  through  supporting  jobs  is 
important at the initial recovery period 
–  In  the  medium  term,  fiscal  policy  should  be  directed  firmly  towards  growth  and 
long term development objectives  
–  Adequate  capital  spending  should  be  a  top  priority  to  address  large  deficits  in 
infrastructure and human capital 
Central banking in post-crisis Africa 
–  Inflation  in  most  countries  has  reverted  to  single  digits,  and  the  likelihood  of  a 
significant liquidity overhang is minimal  
–  In many countries exchange rates have also been strengthening towards the pre-
crisis level. Re-correction after the crisis 
–  All  these  factors  point  towards  retaining  the  current  supportive  monetary  policy 
stance in most countries and for central banks to avoid conventional wisdom to 
raise interest rates soon 
–  Central banks should be in no hurry to tighten their policy rates when underlying 
inflation is below target. They need to continue with the same monetary stance 
until  the  expected  inflationary  pressure  threatens  instability  in  the  economic 
environment 
What the Central Bank of Kenya has done during the crisis 
• 
The  Central  Bank  of  Kenya  –  has  pursued  an  accommodative  monetary  policy 
stance to help cushion the economy from the negative effects of the global financial 
crisis 
Measures taken so far 
–  Reduction of cash reserve ratio from 6% to 4.5% (100 basis points in December 
2008  and  50  basis  points  in  July  2009)  –  thus  releasing  an  equivalent  of 
Ksh.12.5 billion for lending to the economy 
–  Consecutive reduction of the Central Bank Rate from 8.75% to 7.75% to signal to 
banks to lower lending rates 
–  Allowing a reduction in foreign exchange reserves to less than 3 months to take 
pressure  off  the  depreciation  pressure  of  the  Kenya  shilling  vis-à-vis  the  hard 
currencies (Had the CBK not allowed this, the inflationary effect of the shilling’s 
depreciation would have been worse – in terms of intermediate imports, oil prices 
etc)

 Kenya’s fiscal policy attempts to spur economic activity during economic downturn  
The 2009/10 Finance Bill took recovery head on – six solutions: 
• 
• 
Commitment from Treasury to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment 
Creating  fiscal  space  through  expenditure  rationalization  from  non-productive 
sectors/activities to productive sectors 
Reducing the cost of doing business 
Developing  key  infrastructure  facilities  and  public  works  to  stimulate  growth, 
employment and poverty reduction  
Fiscal stimulus through measures that expand economic opportunities in rural areas 
for employment creation 
  Global outlook 
• 
Policies 
The fear of the “Second Great Depression” has subsided 
–  Impact of the crisis on output has been ameliorated by coordinated Government 
 However, significant downside risks remain to the positive outlook 
–  Global recovery could yet prove more anaemic than currently projected 
–  Evidence still unclear as to whether the slowdown has hit bottom in SSA 
Going forward 
• 
flows 
Diversification of trade relations 
–  China and India are gaining entry to African region – perhaps change trade & FDI 
   –  Regional  integration  to  promote  trade  relations.  The  crisis  has  awakened  the 
need for regional integration 
Financial sector development 
–  Put more effort to developing capital markets including bonds and stock markets 
to widen options for saving and investment financing 
–  World  Economic  Outlook  Financial  Development  Index  covers  only  three  SSA 
countries. Development of such index to capture more SSA countries is crucial in 
monitoring progress in the development of the sector 
–  Develop  financial  sector  strategies  to  accommodate  innovative  policy  designs 
and financial innovations 
Partnership 
–  AfDB, IMF and WB have done well so far 
–  They  have  both  short-term  rescue  packages  and  enhanced  development 
assistance 
Mobilization of adequate resources to finance growth 
–  Put  in  place  innovative  avenues  for  investment  and  saving  with  adequate 
financial sector development 
–  Boost development budgets to sustain infrastructure development

 Stay the path of reforms – do not sacrifice long-run growth 
–  But remain within attainable targets – credibility of reforms  
Regulation of the financial sector 
–  An emergence of regulatory arbitrage – Domestic regulators should talk to each 
other 
–  But  we  should  be  careful  not  to  call  for  “more”  regulation  rather  than  “better” 
regulation 
–  “Better” regulation: A regime that can readily identify emerging vulnerabilities; that 
can  properly  price  risks;  and  that  strengthens  incentives  for  prudent  behaviour 
(Andrew Crockett, FD Supplement September 2009)  
Foreign reserves have served countries in Africa well: 
–  In  theory,  in  a  floating  exchange  rate  regime,  there  is  no  need  to  hold  foreign 
exchange reserves or to use them 
–  But  developing  and  emerging  economies  accumulated 
reserves to very high levels – it served them well in the crisis 
foreign  exchange 
–  The future of dollar denominated reserves requires close observation
