Philipp Hildebrand: In the focus of the Swiss National Bank - economic 
outlook and monetary policy 
Summary of a speech by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National 
Bank, at the WGZ-Bank, Luxemburg, 9 September 2005. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 The world economy expands at a robust pace but the growth rates of the important economic blocs 
diverge  considerably.  In  spite  of  the  accommodative  monetary  policy  in  most  industrial  countries, 
inflation and inflation expectations remain well contained which may, among other things, be due to 
the  process  of  globalisation  and  the  credibility  of  central  banks.  Switzerland,  small  and  extremely 
open,  benefits  from  a  recovering  global  economy.  The  conditions  for  returning  to  a  path  of  modest 
expansion look favourable. However, there are certain risks that may affect the global and the Swiss 
economy  negatively.  Most  importantly,  high  oil  prices  and  the  devastating  effect  of  the  hurricane 
„Katrina”,  as  well  as  the  possibility  of  increasing  long-term  interest  rates  have  to  be  mentioned.  A 
persistently high price of oil could act as a brake to demand dynamics and growth prospects could 
also be threatened by soaring long-term interest rates, an effect that could be amplified through the 
housing  channel.  In  the  foreign  exchange  markets,  structural  and  cyclical  factors  continue  to 
determine the value of the US-dollar.
