Paul M W Tucker: Monetary policy, stability and structural change 
Speech by Mr Paul M W Tucker, Executive Director and Member of the Monetary Policy Committee of 
the Bank of England, at the Confederation of British Industry, Guildford, 1 March 2005. 
 MONETARY POLICY, STABILITY AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE1 
Judging  by  the  macroeconomic  data,  either  there  have  been  some  fairly  profound  changes  in  our 
economy or we have been blessed by extraordinary good luck over the past decade or so.  GDP has 
grown without interruption for 50 quarters.  Unemployment has fallen from around 10½ % in 1992 to 
6½  %  in  1997,  and  just  over  4½  %  on  the  latest  reading.    Inflation  fell  through  the  first  half  of  the 
1990s, and since 1997 has, on average, been close to the Government’s target.  All that is, of course, 
well known.   
But  it  may  be  less  familiar  that  quarter-to-quarter  changes  in  output  growth  and  inflation  have  over 
recent  years  exhibited  a  strikingly  different  pattern  from  those  of  previous  decades.    Both  output 
growth and inflation have been less variable (Chart 1; Table 1).  Inflation also seems to have become 
less  persistent.    By  that,  I  mean  that,  whereas  in  the  past  rises  or  falls  in  inflation  tended  to  be 
protracted, more recent fluctuations in inflation have been short lived.  Work undertaken by Bank of 
England  economists,2  summarised  in  Table  2,  suggests  that  –  at  least  statistically  –  this  apparent 
change occurred around the time of the UK’s introduction of inflation targeting in 1992.   
The policy debate – inside and outside the Bank – has recently refocused on the possibility of some 
other changes in the way our economy functions.  Less than 18 months ago, the Bank’s interest rate 
was just 3.5%, essentially because the MPC wanted to stimulate private sector domestic spending to 
offset the effects on aggregate demand of weak net trade, given adverse developments in the world 
economy.  As global conditions recovered, and with a pick up in public sector spending, we were able 
gradually  to  withdraw  much  of  that  stimulus  during  2004  in  a  series  of  steps  which  were  widely 
anticipated and understood across the financial and real economy (Chart 2).   With the slack in the 
economy  being  absorbed,  attention  shifted  to  gauging  the  degree  of  demand  pressures  and  their 
implications for the inflation outlook.  In particular, on the basis of some simple statistical relationships, 
a  question  has  been  posed  about  whether  there  has  been  some  change  in  the  extent  to  which 
demand  pressures  feed  through  into  wages  and  prices.    Most  notably,  as  discussed  in  the  Bank’s 
February  Inflation  Report,  the  steady  falls  in  unemployment  over  recent  years  have  not  been 
accompanied by a rising rate of earnings growth (Chart 3).  These issues obtained some prominence 
towards the end of last year when, despite apparently buoyant demand, inflation on the CPI measure 
fell to 1.1%. 
Lower  variability  in  output  growth  and  inflation,  lower  inflation  persistence,  apparently  weaker  pass 
through of demand pressures – all told, this points to the importance of identifying and understanding 
the complex combination of structural changes affecting our economy.  Today, I plan to give a broad 
overview of some of them, as they confront policymakers.       
Our  standard  tools  of  economic  analysis  –  in  particular,  statistical  modelling  –  are  not  especially 
well-suited  to  real-time  detection  or  quantification  of  the  underlying  forces  of  change.    They  can, 
though, alert us to puzzles when the data persistently deviate from past patterns.  Business managers, 
by  contrast,  are  exposed  to  the  reality  of  change  day  by  day.    Unable  to  shield  yourselves  from 
change,  businesses  can  indeed  succeed  by  embracing  it  –  shaping  your  environment  as  well  as 
responding to it.  That underlines the value of the Bank’s dialogue with business, facilitated and led by 
our regional Agents across the UK.  Colloquially, you enrich our grasp of what is ‘going on out there’.

Economic analysis  then  helps us  to match  your  various real-world  stories  to  puzzles  we  see  in  the 
data. 
Inflation and firms’ price-setting behaviour 
In the medium-to-long run, the average rate of inflation is determined by the rate of nominal expansion 
permitted by the monetary authority.  But over shorter horizons, decisions taken by businesses – in 
particular,  about  wages  and  prices  –  affect  quarter-to-quarter  fluctuations  in  inflation  and,  more 
generally, how demand pressures feed through to inflation.   
Economic  policymakers  draw  on  a  number  of  ways  of  thinking  about  those  influences  on  inflation 
dynamics.  There is no model that can, uniquely, capture the richness of the real world.  But surprising 
though it may be to some, one of the ways in which we think about firms’ price-setting behaviour would 
be familiar to anyone running a business.  Namely, that firms charge a mark up, or profit margin, over 
the marginal costs of their various inputs – labour, capital, raw and intermediate materials, etc – with 
both the mark up and costs varying according to current and prospective demand conditions.  This is 
represented schematically, indeed crudely, in Diagram 1.  The key feature is that when demand rises 
and firms utilise their capacity more fully and add to their labour force, their costs and prices tend to 
rise.    That  might  involve  old-fashioned  ‘cost-push’  inflation,  with  firms  raising  prices  to  maintain 
margins in the face of increased (marginal) costs.  Or firms might initially be able temporarily to raise 
margins, with labour and other costs later ‘catching up’.  In either case, firms and wage bargainers will 
be influenced by what they think is going to happen to inflation in the future.  Again simplifying, two 
features are added to the diagram to bridge from firms’ so-called ‘output’ – or wholesale – prices to the 
retail prices which the Bank targets.  First, as well as being an input to producing firms, some imports 
are directly consumed by households.  Second, distributors – including, most obviously, retailers – add 
another  mark  up,  reflecting  their  own  costs  and  desired  profit  margins.    Changes  in  the  economy 
affecting  any  of  the  links  in  this  (stylised)  chain  will  have  a  bearing  on  inflation  dynamics.    The 
challenge is to separate out cyclical, or temporary, factors from the more structural influences that over 
some periods alter firms’ costs and margins.  That is important for policymakers, as to form a view on 
the  medium-term  outlook  for  inflation  we  need  to  distinguish  between  short-lived  and  persistent 
influences. 
Monetary regime change 
The monetary framework is one such structural influence. 
One of the most encouraging features of the post-1997 landscape has been that, as well as inflation 
tracking the target fairly well, expectations of inflation have been well anchored to the target (Chart 4).  
Uncertainty  about  future  inflation  has  also  fallen3  (Chart  5  ).    It  was  different  in  the  past.    A 
characteristic shared by the various monetary regimes tried out by UK governments during the 1970s 
and  1980s  was  that  no  one  could  easily  judge  what  rate  of  inflation  the  authorities  were  trying  to 
achieve – or, therefore, have much idea about the outlook for inflation.  As feared by one distinguished 
economist  of  an  earlier  generation,  “every  business  venture  [risks  being]  transformed  into  a 
speculation  on  monetary  policy”.4    In  those  circumstances,  it  may  well  have  seemed  reasonable  to 
assume that recent inflation outturns were a good basis for guessing the near-term path of inflation.  
And  given  the  evidence,  firms  and  households  could  also  have  been  forgiven  for  acting  on  an 
assumption  that  the  authorities  would  be  slow  to  respond  to  excess  demand  and  so  to  upward 
pressures on inflation.   
By contrast, the current regime seems, so far at least, to enjoy high credibility.  In consequence, when 
setting prices, firms might well place more weight on policy delivering inflation in line with the target 
than  on  recent  inflation  outturns.    If  so,  that  might  be  part  of  the  explanation  for  the  much  lower 
persistence  in  inflation  I  described  earlier.    In  other  words,  when  shocks  to  the  economy  cause 
inflation  to  deviate  from  target,  firms  may  nevertheless  set  prices  on  the  basis  that  it  will  return  to 
target fairly quickly – which would, of course, itself help to bring inflation back to target.  In a similar

vein, firms and households might now expect the Bank to tweak policy fairly promptly in response to 
shifts in demand.  In which case, the influence of such demand shocks on wage and price setting, and 
so on inflation, would plausibly be somewhat weaker than in the past. 
But sound monetary policy is not the only important change in the economic environment.  That much 
is apparent from even a brief examination of real-economy influences on firms’ costs and prices.  I 
shall discuss just three:  the labour market, financing markets, and competitive conditions in product 
markets. 
Labour market 
For most businesses, their workforce accounts for the major part of their input costs (Chart 6).  Firms 
in  general  –  and  the  economy  in  aggregate  –  have  therefore  been  profoundly  affected  by  the 
transformation in the UK’s labour market over the past quarter century.  The key influences have been 
well  documented.5      In  particular,  industrial  relations  legislation  altered  the  way  in  which  unions 
operate, and union membership has fallen (Chart 7).  Unemployment and social security benefits have 
been progressively reformed, increasing incentives to work.  Use of part-time workers has increased 
(Chart 8), in part due to the expansion of the services sector, and perhaps also more flexible ideas 
about working patterns.  The mechanisms via which employers and employees find each other – job 
search – have improved, helped by investment in employment exchanges and perhaps recently by the 
internet.   
In  combination,  these  developments  provided  the conditions  for unemployment  to  fall  over  the  past 
decade  without  adding  to  inflationary  pressure.    During  the  transition,  the  supply  capacity  of  the 
economy  accordingly  increased  by  more  than  would  otherwise  have  been achieved;  and any  given 
increase in real aggregate demand would have put less pressure than otherwise on supply, and so 
would have had a weaker effect on firms’ costs and prices.   That does not mean, however, that the 
feed through of demand pressures into inflation will be permanently weaker.  Instead, the apparently 
flat relationship, illustrated in Chart 3, between unemployment and wage inflation is, at least in part, 
most probably a symptom of the sustainable level of unemployment having gradually fallen.  That is 
effectively what the MPC has assumed in making judgments about the outlook for inflation.  We can 
be reasonably confident about the direction of change, but not about its size.   
That can be illustrated by the current conjuncture.  Over the past few years, there have been at least 
two other influences at work.  First, for some years we enjoyed an improvement in our ‘terms of trade’.  
That meant, simply put, that the aggregate price of the goods and services we produce and export 
rose  relative  to  the  aggregate  prices  of  our  imports.    This  increased  the  purchasing  power  of 
households’  incomes  (Chart  9),  and so  may  have dampened wage  pressures  as  the  labour  market 
tightened.    To  the  extent  that  this  explanation  should  be  given  any  weight,  it  would  tend  to  be  a 
temporary factor, pointing to an upside risk to earnings growth looking ahead. 
A second apparent feature of our environment works the other way round.  Anecdotally, the role of 
migrant labour has increased in various sectors – partly associated with the enlargement of the EU’s 
single labour market.   If that continued, with new residents continuing to help to meet particular skill 
shortages, the labour supply available to UK businesses would increase, implying that the economy 
could potentially accommodate stronger aggregate demand than otherwise.  However, the available 
data do not really enable us to get beyond anecdote and speculation. 
Financing 
Another important input for firms is finance – for working capital and investment.  Here too, there seem 
to have been changes – in the range and terms of the sources of finance available to both firms and 
households – that could potentially influence the extent of cyclical fluctuations in output and inflation.   
One  characterisation  of  the  past  would  be  that  firms  and  households  depended  on  bank  loans  for 
external finance; and that banks loosened or tightened credit conditions sharply in the different phases

Economic Policy, Vol. 6(4), pages 26-35.

of  a  business  cycle,  reining  back  when  the  economy  suffered  a  downturn  and  arrears  and  losses 
mounted.  For the UK, this is well documented for small-firm finance during the early-90s recession.6 
Although the stability of output growth over the recent past happily deprives us of a proper test, there 
are  reasons  to  think  that  cyclical  swings  in  the  availability  of  finance  may  now  be  somewhat  less 
marked than in the past.  In the first place, the greater stability brought by the new monetary regime 
may make a difference.  Compared with the past, there should be less risk of the monetary authority 
delaying  a  response  to  incipient  inflation  until  the  point  that  it  is  forced  to  slam  on  the  brakes, 
effectively  engineering  recession  to  quell  inflation  expectations  and  in  the  process  contributing  to  a 
sharp spike in unemployment, loan defaults and bank losses. 
A more stable macroeconomic environment may also, by reducing the risks for new entrants, be one 
amongst  a  number  of  influences  fostering  competition.    There  is  perhaps  some  circumstantial 
evidence of that in, for example, the decline in margins on personal loans (Chart 10).   That would tend 
to reduce the credit constraints facing households.  As does the increased availability of loan products 
that enable homeowners to borrow against the free equity in their houses.   
Broadly similar changes have been underway in business finance, where competition also comes from 
outside the banking sector through firms’ access to richer capital markets.  The proportion of UK non-
financial  firms’  debt  accounted  for  by  bonds  has  risen  from  around  15%  in  1990  to  over  30%  now 
(Chart  11).    Our  largest  firms  have  access  to  the  international  commercial  paper,  bond  and 
asset-backed markets; and to derivative markets for managing their financial risks.  For smaller firms, 
compared with a decade or so ago, there seems to have been an expansion in asset-based financing 
options enabling them to utilise collateral more effectively.7 
Taken  together,  a  richer  supply  menu  may  leave  firms  and  households  somewhat  less  exposed  to 
being severely credit rationed in an economic downturn; and may enhance their ability to cope with 
cyclical  economic  fluctuations.    If  that  helped  to  dampen  the  effect  of  shocks,  output  growth  and 
inflation  may  vary  a  little  less  than  otherwise,  and  monetary  policy  may  need  to  respond  less 
aggressively than in the past to keep the economy on a stable path. 
But, again, it can be difficult to disentangle cyclical from more durable changes.  A topical example is 
the risk premium priced into financial instruments.  To pick just one indicator, corporate credit spreads 
have been falling for a few years, to levels that last prevailed in the mid-90s (Chart 12).  In degree, that 
seems likely to reflect a relatively benign global macroeconomic environment together with balance-
-sheet  strengthening  in  the  corporate  sectors  of  a  number  of  major  industrialised  countries.    But, 
conceivably, it also reflects better diversification of risk – facilitated, for example, by the rapid growth of 
new instruments such as credit derivatives and by greater cross-border investment of savings.  If so – 
if risk premia were systemically lowered – that would tend to reduce firms’ cost of capital and increase 
households’ financial wealth.  Alternatively, the price of risk may just be temporarily low, possibly too 
low.8    The  upshot  is  that  we  cannot  yet  be  confident  about  the  durability  and  macroeconomic 
implications of the changes seen in the financial environment. 
Mark ups 
It is a commonplace that competition has intensified.   
This is associated with ‘globalisation’.  The facts are familiar.  World trade has grown relative to world 
output  (Chart  13).    A  wide  range  of  emerging-market  economies,  notably  in  Asia,  have  become 
material  participants  in  the  world  economy.    Some  UK  businesses  have  relocated  part  of  their 
production, or outsourced to firms operating in markets with cheaper labour costs.  Partly reflecting 
these  developments,  although  also  increased  specialisation,  the  share  of  imports  in  UK  business 
investment and in consumption has steadily risen (Chart 14).

These  developments  make  markets  more  contestable.    As  does  effective  competition  policy.    An 
example  in  recent  years  was  the  car  market,  where  prices  converged  with  those  prevailing  on 
continental Europe. 
The internet, or e-commerce, also brings greater contestability, by making it a lot easier for businesses 
to  check  the  prices  of  competing  suppliers,  and  for  consumers  to  compare  prices  across  different 
retailers (Table 3).  
Over time, these forces would be expected to reduce firms’ margins – at least in sectors that were not 
previously  especially  competitive.      So  long  as  that  process  of  adjustment  was  underway,  inflation 
would tend to be lower than would otherwise be implied by any given set of demand conditions.   In 
addition, if and when their margins became thinner, firms might become more aggressive in controlling 
costs in the face of fluctuating demand, which might weaken the pass through of demand shocks into 
inflation.  
The new monetary framework might reinforce some of those effects.  Over recent years, more than a 
handful of business managers have commented that, when inflation was both high and highly variable, 
it used to be easier to implement – or ‘get away with’ – price increases.  In a low inflation environment, 
it should be easier for business customers and consumers to distinguish relative price changes from 
increases  in  the  general  price  level.    That  too  should  foster  greater  flexibility  and  efficiency  in  our 
economy; and is one of the contributions that low and stable inflation can potentially make to broader 
economic welfare.  
One  striking  example  is  the  distribution  sector.    Anecdotally,  competition  in  UK  retailing  has  been 
intense.  This seems to manifest itself in the aggregate data in two phases.  As documented recently 
by my MPC colleague Steve Nickell,9 retailers’ margins were compressed in the years around the turn 
of the century.  Since then, they seem to have crushed their costs through measures delivering rapid 
productivity  growth.    In  part,  that  appears  to  have  been  achieved  by  disintermediating  wholesale 
distributors, whose margins have continued to fall (Chart 15).   At a macro level, the effect was, for a 
period, to open up a gap between producer output price inflation and retail goods price inflation (Chart 
16).  In other words, for a while some structural changes in the distribution sector reduced the feed 
through  of  demand  pressures  into  retail  price  inflation.    Looking  ahead,  one  downside  risk  to  the 
MPC’s central projection is that we cannot rule out that this process has further to go.   
The current conjuncture and policy  
Monetary  regime  change,  labour  market  reform,  financial  innovation,  the  technological  revolution, 
globalisation – it is a heady combination, which unavoidably adds to the challenge of discriminating 
between cyclical and structural influences when forming a view on the macroeconomic outlook.  But it 
is equally unavoidable that policymakers must try to do just that. 
That brings me to the current conjuncture and so to policy. 
My own take at present is as follows.  In my judgment, there is, on balance, most likely a degree of 
excess demand in the economy.  Surveys suggest above-average capacity utilisation.  And there is 
some corroborative evidence in the rise in output price inflation relative to costs, and in anecdote of 
some firms being able to pass on cost increases (Chart 17).   
Given a tight labour market, how does that fit with earnings inflation having been relatively subdued?  
One  possibility  is  that  as  aggregate  demand  has  picked  up,  firms  have  in  the  first  place  increased 
output by making greater use of their existing workforce and capital.  That would be consistent with 
anecdotal  evidence  of  firms  having  held  on  to  labour  during  the  earlier  slowdown  in  aggregate 
demand;  and with the pick up in private sector productivity growth over the past year or so (Chart 18).  
Looking ahead, it would also suggest a degree of upwards pressure on earnings growth. 
As reflected in the Inflation Report published a couple of weeks ago, conditions of excess demand, 
combined with the likelihood of stronger import prices, point to inflation gradually rising back towards 
and through the 2% target over the next two years or so.   There are many risks around that central 
outlook but, taken together, compared with November I judge them to be slightly less to the downside 
over the medium term.  The recent rise in CPI inflation suggests, for example, that we were not stuck

materially below the inflation target.  And, as I discussed earlier, the puzzle about the apparent weak 
feed  through  from  demand  to  inflation  is  reduced  somewhat  by  the  Committee’s  judgment  that  the 
performance  of  the  labour  market  improved  over  recent  years.    That  leaves  continuing  demand 
pressures likely to feed through to inflation, looking ahead.  With monetary policy needing to be set on 
a medium-term view, overall I concluded at the MPC’s latest meeting that our interest rate should be 
increased by 25 basis points – a small tweak to reflect the outlook.   
But, as my remarks today have emphasised, there are considerable uncertainties.  Two final thoughts 
about them. 
The first concerns the precision with which any monetary authority can achieve its objective.  In the 
bad old days, it should probably have been clear when the economy was experiencing unsustainable 
excess  demand.    In  today’s  world,  when  we  discuss  excess  or  deficient  demand  we  are  generally 
addressing  much  smaller  deviations  from  trend  than  in  the  past,  as  Chart  19  suggests.    In 
consequence, our debates about cyclical conditions lie well within the margin of error of any sensible 
estimate of underlying trends – especially given uncertainty about the structural changes affecting the 
economy.    In  a  similar  vein,  we  –  and  commentators  –  need  to  keep  some  perspective  about 
deviations from the inflation target.  In November, the year-on-year measure of CPI inflation was 1.1%.  
By January it was 1.6%.   
Secondly,  when  inflationary  problems  loomed  in  the  past,  inflation  expectations  –  amongst 
businesses, households and in financial markets – increased, both signalling and bringing about the 
incipient rise in inflation.  Today, we appear to enjoy well-anchored inflation expectations, which will 
affect  price-setting  behaviour  in  the ways  I  have  touched  on.    Indeed, modern  economic models of 
various kinds – inside and outside the Bank – tend to assume policy credibility, anchoring medium-
term expectations.  If that were so, the medium-term outlook for inflation would be assured.  In fact, 
credibility  is  not  something  that  can  just  be  assumed.    It  has  to  be  achieved,  and  continually 
reachieved, by policymakers – through our actions, and reasoned explanations of them.   
For that reason alone, policy inevitably remains a judgmental process – not one mechanically tied to a 
particular model, but one that draws on a wide range of inputs, including the insights of our business 
contacts.  Learning is, accordingly, inherent in our mission.  Over the next few years, if the economy 
escapes  being  buffeted  by  shocks,  we  will  learn  quite  a  lot.    In  the  meantime,  notwithstanding  the 
uncertainties, we have to make judgments and explain them.
