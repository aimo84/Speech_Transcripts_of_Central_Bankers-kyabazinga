Ignazio  Visco:  Fact-finding  with  regard  to  the  decree  law  containing 
urgent measures for growth, equity and the consolidation of the public 
finances 
Testimony  of  Mr  Ignazio  Visco,  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Italy,  at  the  Joint  Session  of  the 
Fifth Committees of the Italian Senate and Chamber of Deputies, Rome, 9 December 2011. 
 The sovereign debt crises in the euro area call for robust, rapid and courageous responses 
at  the  national,  European  and  global  levels.  In  Italy  tensions  have  worsened  since  the 
summer,  with  alarming  repercussions  on  the  spread  between  Italian  and  German 
government bonds. The Government’s decree law which supplements the measures passed 
in July and August, is a necessary and urgent step to re-establish the creditworthiness of the 
Italian state and avoid extremely serious and lasting consequences for the real economy.  
The measures, which aim to achieve budgetary balance in 2013, determine an adjustment 
on the order of €20 billion annually for each of the next three years. Taking the measures 
adopted in the summer into account, the adjustment in 2013 is equal to €76 billion. About two 
thirds of the new measures are on the revenue side, pushing the ratio of taxes and social 
security contributions to GDP up to around 45 per cent. The procedures for implementing the 
safeguard clause linked to the enabling law for tax and welfare reform are defined. 
The measures on government spending mostly affect pensions, completing the long process 
of  reform  serving  to  bring  our  system  into  line  with  the  changed  socio-demographic  and 
economic  growth  prospects.  Partly  as  a  result  of  the  adjustments  made  in  the  summer, 
primary  spending  falls  in  nominal  terms.  The  only  way  to  increase  its  efficiency  is  by 
systematically evaluating individual spending items. 
Firm  action  against  tax  evasion  remains  a  priority.  The  tax  base  brought  to  light  and  the 
resources released following the rationalization of spending, will make it possible to achieve 
the  reduction  in  the  tax  burden  needed  to  give  greater  stimulus  to  enterprise  and 
employment. 
The budgetary provisions contained in the decree will cause GDP to decline by an estimated 
half a percentage point in the next two years. The impact could be largely offset if the fall in 
the yield on Italian 10-year bonds seen in the days immediately following the promulgation of 
the decree were to be confirmed and extend across the entire range of maturities. 
The  effort

competitiveness and the creation of more jobs must be intensified, by rapidly implementing 
effective measures supplementing those already defined in the Government decree, in an all-
embracing  framework  to  provide  lasting  reassurance  to  those  who  have  invested  and  are

The decree law of 6 December 2011 
1. 
The  decree  law  reduces  net  borrowing  by  €20.2  billion  in  2012,  €21.3  billion  in  2013  and 
€21.4 billion in 2014.  In relation to GDP, the adjustment is equal to 1.3 percentage points in 
each year. The measures are in addition to those approved during the summer and those 
introduced by the 2012 Stability Law, which provided for a reduction in the budget deficit of 
€28.6 billion in 2012, €54.4 billion in 2013 and €59.9 billion in 2014. In total, the measures

should reduce net borrowing by about 3 percentage points of GDP in 2012 and by more than 
4.5 points on average in the two years 2013–14.1  
A large part of the correction involves revenue, with effects that decline over the three-year 
period  (from  €17.9  billion  in  2012  to  €12.1  billion  in  2014).  On  the  spending  side  the 
adjustment, which rises from €2.3 billion in 2012 to €9.3 billion in 2014, is mainly due to the 
measures relating to pensions. 
Over  the  three  years,  the  measures  generate  resources  totaling  €32.3  billion  in  2012, 
€35.1 billion in 2013 and €37.1 billion in 2014. In part these amounts are used for tax relief 
(€3.6,  €7.3  and  €8.4  billion  respectively),  for  extra  expenditure  (€4.6  billion  in  2012  and 
€3.6 billion  in  2013  and  2014)  and  to  reduce  the  resources  to  be  raised  with  the 
implementation  of  the  enabling  law  on  tax  and  welfare  reform  (€4.0  billion  in  2012, 
€2.9 billion in 2013 and €3.6 billion in 2014). 
In  particular,  the  decree  eliminates  the  doubts  about  the  effects  of  the  enabling  law 
(€4.0 billion  in  2012,  €16  billion  in  2013  and  €20  billion  in  2014)  and  the  procedures  for 
implementing  the  relative  safeguard  clause.  Part  of  the  resources  in  relation  to  2012 
(€3.3 billion of the aforementioned €4.0 billion) derives from the increase of two percentage 
points in the reduced and standard VAT rates (to 12 per cent and 23 per cent respectively) 
from  next  October.  The  safeguard  clause  has  been  redefined:  the  previously  mentioned 
increase in VAT rates will become permanent and will be followed by a further increase in the 
rates of half a percentage point in 2014 if provisions have not come into force by September 
2012 to implement the enabling law or if modifications are not made to the tax exemption and 
subsidy  systems  producing  €13.1  billion  of  additional  revenue  in  2013  and  €16.4  billion  in 
2014. 
With  the  aim  of  encouraging  competition,  the  decree  law  also  provides  for  liberalization 
measures in some sectors (retail outlets, pharmacies and transport), measures to increase 
the  powers  of  the  Antitrust  Authority  (AGCM),  and  others  to  simplify  the  procedures  and 
reduce the time taken to build infrastructure. 
An overall evaluation 
2. 
The sharp deterioration in growth prospects in recent months and the drastic worsening of 
state funding conditions mean that last summer’s corrective measures, although important, 
are  now  insufficient  to  respect  the  commitment  made  at  European  level  to  achieve  a 
balanced  budget  in  2013.  There  was  a  further  increase  in  the  spread  between  Italian  and 
German 10-year bonds which, in the second week of November, peaked at 575 basis points. 
Additional  measures  were  therefore  urgently  needed  to  consolidate  the  budget  and  even 
more resolute action to address the structural problems of Italy’s economy.  
The packages passed in July, August and December show Italy’s determination to achieve a 
permanent adjustment of its public finances; they make it possible to achieve the objectives 
announced: a balanced budget in 2013 remains the fixed objective for fiscal policy.  
The  size  of  the  austerity  package  presented  on  6  December  is  intended  to  reassure  the 
markets; it is larger than what would have been necessary in the less troubled times of a few 
months  ago.  The  measures  have  effects  which  are  permanent  and,  in  particular  with 
reference  to  pensions,  increasing  over  time.  The  contribution  of  one-off  measures  to  the 
adjustment is small. 
Pension  reform,  by  setting  more  stringent  requirements  for  retirement,  immediately 
strengthens the financial sustainability of the pension system. The measures, whose costs in

terms  of  reducing  spending  power  and  frustrating  individual  expectations  cannot  be 
concealed, virtually complete the long phase of adjusting the system to the changed socio-
demographic situation and economic growth prospects. The extension of the contributions-
based  system  to  all  workers  reduces  disparity  in  treatment  and  links  the  benefits received 
more closely to the contributions paid in, thereby reducing distortions in the supply of labour. 
The challenge now is to provide older workers with satisfactory job opportunities and offer 
younger ones regular careers that produce sufficient cumulative pension contributions. It is 
essential,  therefore,  to  adapt  the  labour  market  rules,  revise  unemployment  and  welfare 
benefits, and reinforce private pension funds. 
Given the need to lower net borrowing very quickly, the correction relies largely on revenue 
increases.  This  will  result  in  a  further  rise  in  total  taxes  and  social  contributions  to  about 
45 per cent of GDP, very high by both historical and international standards. 
The composition of tax revenue has been somewhat modified in order to sustain economic 
activity and enhance competitiveness. Some tax relief is granted to firms for the purpose of 
strengthening  their  capital  bases  and  reducing  labour  costs,  thus  helping  to  boost 
employment. 
Above all, levies on assets and consumption are increased. The stepped-up taxation of real 
estate  is  consistent  with  government  decentralization,  because  it  tightens  the  direct  link 
between taxes paid and public services. Instituting ordinary forms of taxation of total wealth, 
as in other countries and also with a view to reducing income tax, requires the preparation of 
adequate means of acquiring information. 
A contribution to achieving the public finance targets is to come from a strict curb on primary 
expenditure,  which  should  be  €4  billion  less  in  2013  than  in  2010,  requiring  a  significant 
reduction in real terms. Only if appropriate mechanisms for detailed, item-by-item analysis of 
spending  and  accurate  indicators  of  the  efficiency  of  public  structures  (offices,  schools, 
hospitals and courts) are put in place can the adequacy of the appropriation for each item be 
assessed independently of the amount of past spending. Resolute action along these lines 
while proceeding with cost containment and reduction for public agencies and governmental 
institutions can help in the medium run to free resources for reducing the tax burden. 
On  30  November  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  approved  on  first  reading  a  constitutional 
amendment requiring a balanced general government budget. A rule of this sort can help to 
maintain the budgetary balance set to be reached in 2013. In the past, the accomplishments 
of sharp fiscal adjustments have been eroded in the years that followed. 
Some measures are designed for more effective action against tax evasion, which is Italy’s 
most serious obstacle to the fair sharing of the fiscal burden. It is essential to continue along 
these  lines,  in  particular  by  enhancing  the  effectiveness  of  administrative  action.  Among 
other things, shrinking the area of tax evasion facilitates the design of programmes for low-
income  citizens,  for  which  it  is  essential  to  have  reliable  information  on  the  real  economic 
situation of households. Looking ahead, this could make it possible to ease the concentration 
of the tax burden and step up incentives for labour and enterprise. The tax wedge on labour 
income in Italy is 5.5 percentage points higher than the euro-area average. The official tax 
rate on corporate income, even excluding the regional tax on productive activity, is more than 
4 points higher. 
In the medium term significant tax cuts must be accompanied by curbs on spending. If gains 
on this front were made more rapidly, there could be an attenuation of the rise in VAT rates 
provided for in case of failure to implement the tax and welfare enabling act, in particular the 
projected rise on items currently subject to the reduced rate of 10 per cent, which would have 
the most strongly regressive effect on income distribution. 
With  a  view  to  stimulating  a  return  to  faster  economic  growth,  the  structural  measures 
contained  in  the  decree  remove  some  constraints  and  restrictions  on  competition  and 
business activity and will simplify and accelerate the realization of infrastructure projects.

The  liberalization  of  pharmacies,  retailing  and  transport  resumes  the  reform  processes 
initiated  in  the  second  half  of  the  last  decade.  Powers  of  regulation  and  monitoring  are 
assigned to independent authorities (which will incorporate today’s existing agencies) in the 
sectors of water management and postal services. This is a course already given significant 
impulse  by  the  measures  taken  during  the  summer  concerning  professional  services  and 
local  public  services;  it  must  be  resolutely  pursued  with  effective  implementation  of  the 
measures already enacted. 
Further  reforms  will  be  needed  to  make  the  set  of  structural  actions  consistent  and 
comprehensive, with priorities being established and account taken of Italy’s standing in the 
most  common  international  rankings,  in  order  to  improve  the  perception  of  the  country 
system by foreign investors as well. 
The Government’s decision not to intervene immediately, in the decree, on issues involving 
employment relations and unemployment and welfare benefits will make it possible to hear 
the  views  of  labour  and  employer  organizations.  Nevertheless,  action  on  these  matters  is 
urgent, in particular to provide for easier and more secure access to the job market for young 
people  and  ensure  that  they  can  achieve  economic  advancement  that  is  not  ephemeral. 
Welfare  reform  should  form  part  of  an  overall  vision  of  social  protection  guided  by  the 
principle  of  universality.  This  means,  among  other  things,  combining  the  income  support 
programmes  for  workers  who  lose  their  jobs  with  active  policies  of  retraining  and 
occupational reintegration. 
The outlook 
3. 
Over the past few months the outlook for growth in the euro area has deteriorated steadily. 
Cyclical indicators point to a further slackening of economic activity in the fourth quarter from 
the  already  low  rates  of  growth  registered  in  the  central  part  of  the  year.  The  Eurosystem 
projections  released  yesterday,  which  are  basically  in  line  with  the  latest  estimates  of  the 
main international organizations and leading private forecasters, are for modest GDP growth 
in  2012,  held  back  on  the  one  hand  by  the  slowdown  in  world  trade  and  less  expansive 
budgetary  policies  and on  the  other  by  the  sovereign  debt strains  and the  heightened  risk 
aversion of economic agents. 
Against  this  backdrop,  economic  activity  in  Italy  is  subject  to  additional  factors  of  fragility, 
connected above all with the large public debt; these will be reflected in a contraction of GDP 
in  2012  and  very  slow  growth  in  2013.  The  worsening  of  the  growth  outlook  since  last 
summer’s forecasts reflects the measures for the adjustment of the public finances enacted 
in recent months and the exceptional widening of the spread vis-à-vis German government 
bonds,  which  is  being  passed  through  to  the  cost  of  finance  to  the  private  sector  and  the 
spending  plans  of  households  and  firms,  thereby  diminishing  the  domestic  component  of 
aggregate demand. A further tightening of credit supply terms could follow if banks continue 
to encounter funding difficulties on wholesale markets. 
The  macroeconomic  picture  for  the  next  few  quarters  is  marked  by  extraordinarily  great 
uncertainty,  provoked  mainly  by  the  euro-area  public  debt  crisis.  If  the  yield  spreads  on 
government bonds were to remain very wide for a long time, this would further undermine the 
outlook  for  growth  and  constitute  an  obstacle  to  the  planned  adjustment  of  the  public 
finances. Restoring confidence is essential to sustain growth. 
Other  things  being  equal,  the  budget  measures  contained  in  the  decree,  which  are 
indispensable  to  avert  still  worse  scenarios,  will  inevitably  have  a  negative  impact  on 
economic activity. Going by the historical pattern, the impact of the additional measures on 
GDP  can  be  estimated  as  amounting  to  about  half  a  percentage  point  over  the  next  two 
years. 
However,  this  restrictive  effect  may  be  countered  by  the  positive  effects  of  increased 
confidence  in  Italy’s  ability  to  honour  its  debt  and  improving  medium-term  prospects  for 
4

economic growth. A reduction in the cost of finance to the public sector and to households 
and  firms  could  favour  growth  in  the  immediate.  The  initial  impact  of  the  Government’s 
measures is indicative: the day after the announcement of the package the yield on ten-year 
bonds came down by 80 basis points. A reduction of that amount, if it were permanent and 
extended to the entire yield curve, would largely compensate for the restrictive effects of the 
budget package. 
The Government has also introduced measures to sustain economic growth, such as a tax 
allowance  for  corporate  equity,  the  deductibility  of  the  portion  of  IRAP  relating  to  labour 
costs,  provisions  to  foster  competition  and  measures  for  infrastructure  investment.  Action 
must proceed with wide-ranging measures that gradually bring the economy up to a higher 
and better balanced growth path. 
It is crucial to establish a clear and credible comprehensive framework within which to place 
individual  measures.  This  programme  must  comprise  both  the  measures  already  specified 
and  those  to  be  designed  starting  today.  It  must  apply  both  to  the  measures  that  can  be 
taken in the short term and to those that will require more time. A comprehensive approach 
to  the  design  of  pro-growth  measures  can  bolster  confidence  in  the  prospects  for  our 
economy, with beneficial effects on investment and the cost of the public debt. 
The measures – as we know – must aim to reduce administrative costs and the length of 
judicial proceedings; improve the efficacy of regulation and stimulate competition; raise the 
quality  of  public  services  and  obtain  better  terms  for  infrastructure  projects,  including  by 
means  of  resolute  action  on  the  legality  front;  they  must  also  remove  the  obstacles  to  the 
growth  of  firms’  size,  enhance  the  formation  of  human  capital,  facilitate  innovation  and 
improve the working of the labour market.

Summary of the decree law’s main provisions 
Appendix:  
Measures that increase revenue 
A.1 
The decree produces increased revenue of €25.5 billion in 2012, €24.6 billion in 2013 and 
€24.1 billion in 2014. Most of the increase comes from the taxation of real estate and excise 
duties.  Other  measures  increase  the  taxation  of  assets  other  than  real  estate.  Further 
provisions are designed to strengthen the fight against tax evasion. 
Taxation  of  real  estate.  –  The  decree  brings  forward  the  entry  into  force  of  the  own 
municipal tax (IMP), instituted by the legislative decree on municipal federalism, from 2014 to 
2012 and modifies the related tax base significantly. The latter now includes first homes and 
is  calculated  by  applying  higher  adjustment  factors  to  upwardly  revised  cadastral  income 
than those previously in force for the municipal property tax (ICI), especially for residential 
buildings. 
As  already  provided  by  the  March  legislative  decree  for  the  implementation  of  municipal 
federalism, the new tax supersedes ICI and personal income tax (plus the related surtaxes) 
on  imputed  income  from  non-leased  property  (second  homes).  The  basic  IMP  rate  is 
confirmed at 0.76 per cent, except for first homes and rural buildings for instrumental use, to 
which reduced rates of respectively 0.4 and 0.2 per cent apply. For first homes there is a tax 
credit of €200. Municipalities may raise or lower the basic rate by 0.3 percentage points and 
the rate on first homes by 0.2 points. They may also raise the tax credit up to the amount of 
the tax due, but in this case they may not increase the ordinary rate for houses available for 
use by the owner. 
The central government is reserved half of the receipts from buildings other than first homes 
and rural buildings for instrumental use, determined by applying the basic rate; that share is 
officially  estimated  at  €9  billion.  The  increase  in  municipal  revenues  deriving  from  the 
introduction of IMP (€2 billion according to the official estimates) is offset by a reduction in 
central government transfers to municipalities. 
Going  forward,  the  revision  of  cadastral  values  needs  to  be  accelerated.  According  to  the 
Revenue Agency’s latest estimates, the overall market value of the stock of housing is much 
higher  than  its  taxable  value;  the  discrepancy  increases  with  the  real-estate  wealth  of  the 
owners; it also varies greatly according to the exact urban location and age of the building. 
Updating  cadastral  values  would  permit  a  rebalancing  of  these  distributive  aspects  while 
keeping receipts unchanged. 
Regional  personal  income  surtax.  –  The  decree  law  has  raised  the  basic  rate  of  the 
regional  personal  income  surtax  from  0.93  to  1.23  per  cent  with  effect  from  the  2011  tax 
year. According to the official estimates, this will produce additional revenue of €2.2 billion 
from  2012  onwards,  offset  in  regional  budgets  by  the  reduction  in  central  government 
transfers to finance health care. 
Excise  duties.  –  The  decree  provides  for  an  immediate  increase  in  the  excise  duties  on 
petrol, diesel oil, LPG and methane for use as fuels, with the additional revenue estimated at 
€5.9 billion per year (including the secondary effects on value-added tax); the receipts from 
the above excise duties are put at more than €30 billion. The impact of these increases on 
consumer price inflation in 2012 will be on the order of 0.2 percentage points. 
Taxation  of  assets  other  than  real  estate.  –  The  decree  law  rationalizes  the  measure 
introduced with the first budget correction during the summer regarding the stamp duty on 
securities accounts by extending the tax to apply to financial products not held in securities 
accounts, except for pension funds and health funds. The tax levied as a fixed amount for 
different securities value brackets is replaced by a proportional levy of 0.1 per cent in 2012 
6 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches
and 0.15 per cent thereafter. A minimum of €34.20 and maximum of €1,200 are set for the 
amount of tax payable. Lastly, where possible the securities are to be calculated at market 
rather than face value. According to the official estimates, the additional revenue with respect 
to  the  stamp  duty  enacted  during  the  summer  should  be  €1  billion  a  year  in  the  next  two 
years and €0.5 billion a year thereafter. 
The decree also establishes a one-off 1.5 per cent levy on assets repatriated or disclosed 
under  the  favourable  tax  measures  introduced  in  2001  and  2009,  with  the  proceeds 
estimated at €1.1 billion in 2012 and in 2013. 
A series of provisions increase the taxes on the ownership and use of luxury goods such as 
large cars, boats and airplanes. They will yield additional revenue of €0.4 billion. 
Measures against tax evasion. – The decree attacks tax evasion by reducing the ceiling for 
cash transactions from €2,500 to €1,000. A further reduction would be desirable and should 
be accompanied by a reduction in the costs of using electronic money. In addition, to foster 
the  emergence  of  tax  bases,  some  benefits  are  introduced  from  2013  onwards  for  natural 
persons, partnerships and taxpayers subject to sector studies adopting transparent courses 
of conduct in tax matters. 
Checks conducted by the Revenue Agency and the Finance Police on the basis of specific 
analyses  of  the  risk  of  evasion  are  to  be  strengthened.  Accordingly,  from  2012  onwards 
banks  and  other  financial  intermediaries  will  be  required  to  transmit  the  data  on  financial 
movements  on  customers’  accounts  to  the  authorities  for  the  purpose  of  tax  audits.  By 
significantly  expanding  the  database  available  to  the  tax  authorities,  the  measure  will 
facilitate  the  exercise  of  other  powers  such  as  the  use  of  presumptive  income  tables  and 
audits  of  persons  not  in  conformity  with  sector  studies.  Further,  INPS  will  be  required  to 
inform  the  tax  authorities  of  the  social  and  welfare  services  and  benefits  provided  to 
taxpayers, thereby making it easier to check the accuracy of declared incomes. 
To foster the modernization and efficiency of payment instruments and reduce the financial 
and administrative costs deriving from cash management, payments by general government 
in  amounts  greater  than  €500  are  to  be  made  by  means  of  electronic  instruments  and 
cashless procedures. 
Tax reductions 
A.2 
The austerity package entails revenue decreases of €7.6 billion in 2012, €10.2 billion in 2013 
and €12.0 billion in 2014. Apart from the safeguard clause, the main measures introduce tax 
reliefs in favour of firms.  
Deductibility of the return on new equity. – Among the measures for growth, the decree 
law introduces an “aid to economic growth” modelled on the allowance for corporate equity, 
i.e.  in  the  form  of  the  deductibility  of  the  normal  return  on  equity,  estimated  by  applying  a 
notional return to new issues of equity. This mechanism makes for greater tax neutrality in 
the  choices  of  corporate  financing,  fostering  a  reinforcement  of  Italian  businesses’  capital 
structure.  
The facilitation applies to increases in equity capital with respect to the level at the end of the 
financial year in course on 31 December 2010. Given its incremental nature, the measure 
can couple moderate losses of revenue with powerful incentive effects and enable firms to 
undertake  more  innovative  and  potentially  more  productive  and  remunerative  investment 
projects. Consequently it can foster the growth in size of Italian firms and impart impetus to 
new initiatives. 
The expected reduction in receipts amounts to €1.0 billion next year, €1.4 billion in 2013 and 
€2.9 billion in 2014. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

Deductibility  of  IRAP  and  reduction  in  labour  costs.  –  The  staff  costs  subject  to  the 
regional tax on productive activities (IRAP) are to be totally deductible from corporate income 
tax and personal income tax from 2012 onwards, with an estimated decrease in revenue of 
€1.5 billion in 2012, €1.9 billion in 2013 and €2.0 billion in 2014. Furthermore, the deduction 
from  the  IRAP  tax  base  that  firms  can  claim  for  each  new  female  employee  or  each  new 
employee under age 35 hired on a permanent contract is increased by €6,000. By reducing 
labour costs, these measures could have positive effects on firms’ competitiveness and the 
labour market participation of women and young people. 
In the case of an employee with gross earnings equal to the national accounts average for 
2010,  the  new  deductions  for  workers  under  35  and  for  women  constitute  a  benefit 
equivalent to 0.5 per cent of the cost of labour. 
Measures affecting expenditure 
A.3 
Expenditure will be reduced mainly through intervention on pensions and transfers to local 
government. Measures will also be taken to contain the running costs of public agencies and 
institutional bodies. 
Pensions. – The decree law completely overhauls the rules on pensions.  
From  2012  the  contributions-based  method  of  calculating  pensions  will  also  apply  on  a 
pro-rata basis to people with over 18 years of contributions in 1995: this will reduce, albeit to 
a limited degree, the unequal treatment favouring this category (in fact, for everyone else the 
new method has been in use since 1995). 
From 2018 the adjustment of qualifying age and contribution requirements to life expectancy 
and the recalculation of the coefficients for converting the total amount of contributions into 
income will take place every two years, instead of every three. 
As  far  as  old-age  pensions  are  concerned,  the  alignment  of  the  qualifying  age  for  female 
workers in the private sector to that of other workers will be brought forward. The qualifying 
age will be 66 for everyone starting in 2018 (barring any increments due to changes in life 
expectancy). 
The quota system for long-service pensions is abolished. In order to claim such benefits the 
following requirements must be met: in 2012, 42 years and 1 month of contributions for men 
and 41 years and 1 month of contributions for women. If retirement is taken before the age of 
62, a penalty is levied amounting to 2 per cent for each year up to that age. In addition, the 
qualifying age of 62 years and the qualifying contribution period are henceforth anchored to 
future changes in life expectancy. 
The  system  of  “claim  windows”  is  abolished  and  the  qualifying  age  and  contribution 
requirements are increased accordingly. This change does not alter the full retirement age, 
but it does simplify the regulations. 
For workers paying into the contribution system alone, i.e. those who entered the workplace 
on or after 1 January 1996, an element of flexibility is offered: they may claim their pension if 
they  fulfil  the  following  requirements:  63  years  of  age,  20  years  of  contributions,  and  a 
pension equal to at least 2.8 times the minimum state pension. In practice, it will be a long 
time before this rule is applied on a large scale. The qualifying age of 63 years will also take 
account of changes in life expectancy. 
The  contribution  rate  for  self-employed  workers  is  increased  (by  0.3  percentage  points  a 
year, to a maximum of 22 per cent). A solidarity contribution is introduced from 2012 to 2017, 
to be levied on contributions paid into and pensions paid out by the airline workers’ pension 
fund  and  other  pension  funds  incorporated  into  the  INPS  employee  workers’  pension  fund 
(only if those pensions are more than five times the minimum).

Last,  the  indexation  of  pensions  amounting  to  more  than  twice  the  minimum  (€937)  is 
suspended in 2012 and 2013, thereby reducing net borrowing by €2.9 billion and €4.9 billion. 
This measure replaces the one included in the summer reform package. There is no change 
in the solidarity contribution applying to pensions of over €90,000 (equal to 5 per cent of the 
part from €90,000 to €150,000 and 10 per cent of the amount exceeding €150,000). 
Transfers to local government. – The austerity package includes a reduction of €2.8 billion 
in local government transfers starting in 2012: €0.9 billion less to the special-statute regions, 
€0.4 billion less to the provinces and €1.5 billion less to the municipalities. For the special-
statute regions the spending cuts are enacted through ad hoc coordination procedures and 
for  the  provinces  and  municipalities  through  reductions  in  transfers  to  the  experimental 
“re-balancing”  funds  (for  the  redistribution  of  property  taxes)  and  to  the  fiscal  revenue 
equalization funds (as well as in fiscal transfers to such bodies in Sicily and Sardinia).  
Operating  costs  of  some  public  agencies  and  institutional  bodies.  –  Measures  are 
introduced  to  reduce  the  operating  costs  of  some  public  agencies.  A  few  of  the  latter  are 
abolished and their functions, and permanent staff, transferred to other bodies. 
The  functions  of  INPDAP  (National  Pension  Institute  for  General  Government  Employees) 
and ENPALS (National Pension and Healthcare Institute for the Entertainment Industry) are 
transferred to INPS. This measure is estimated to produce a saving of at least €20 million in 
2012, €50 million in 2013 and €100 million from 2014, which will be devolved to the sinking 
fund for the redemption of government securities. 
The decree envisages a reduction in the number of independent administrative authorities.  
If  the  committee  instituted  under  the  July  package  with  the  objective  of  bringing  the 
compensation of Italian elected offices into line with European averages has not completed 
its mandate by the end of 2011, the Government will introduce a measure of its own. 
The  functioning  of  the  provinces  is  to  be  overhauled  by  taking  action  on  three  levels: 
transferring functions to municipalities and regions (except for municipal policy guidance and 
coordination),  reducing  the  number  of  councillors  to  a  maximum  of  ten  (appointed  by  the 
elected municipal bodies within the province), and eliminating the board of councillors, with 
the  exception  of  the  chairman.  The  measures  should  be  finalized  by  30  April  2012.  More 
drastic measures to eliminate and reorganize local authorities may be introduced by laws of 
constitutional force. 
Economies of scale are exploited by adopting centralized management systems for calls to 
tender  issued  by  municipalities  with  up  to  5,000  inhabitants.  Moreover,  elected  offices  of 
local authorities not envisaged in the Constitution will not receive any compensation. 
Increases  in  expenditure.  –  The  austerity  package  includes  some  measures  that  raise 
expenditure; the increase in spending is estimated at €4.6 billion in 2012 and €3.6 billion in 
2013  and  2014.  The  budget  funds  for  development  and  local  transport  are  increased  (by 
€1.8 billion each  year  for  the  next  three  years).  In  addition,  peace  missions  are  to  receive 
new  funding  (€0.8  billion  in  2012)  and  spending  on  road  transport  is  expected  to  rise  (by 
€1.1 billion each year) to offset the increase in costs resulting from higher fuel taxes. 
Other measures 
A.4 
The impact on the budget of some of the measures included in the package is not quantified 
for reasons of caution. Above all, these are measures that regulate the allocation of part of 
the revenue from the sale of CO2 emission quotas to the sinking fund for the redemption of 
government securities. 
The  fund  is  also  allocated  any  revenue  from  projects  envisaged  under  the  package  to 
enhance public real-estate assets at local level by setting up companies, consortiums or local 
property funds. Such projects are promoted by the State Property Office, which works with 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

the public management agencies and can join the company or other body as partner, as well 
as  select  potential  private  sector  participants.  These  measures  are  in  line  with  the 
commitments entered into by the previous government. 
The austerity package also provides for lira coins, notes and banknotes still in circulation to 
lapse and for their value to be assigned to the sinking fund for the redemption of government 
securities.  At  the  beginning  of  December,  lira  banknotes  in  circulation  amounted  to 
€1,272 million;  after  the  adoption  of  the  euro,  the  Treasury  was  assigned  €837  million,  of 
which €662 million represented an advance on the lire that would lapse on 28 February 2012 
and €175 million represented lira banknotes lapsing in the interval; the remaining sum to be 
assigned to the Treasury should therefore be on the order of €600 million. 
Structural measures for growth 
A.5 
Liberalizations. – The decree law provides for the liberalization of shop opening hours and 
days, extending the trial measures adopted in tourist locations and cities of art and culture, 
and introduces the principle of freedom of opening hours, excluding restrictions of any kind 
except for those safeguarding workers’ health and the environment.  
In  order  to  promote  competition  in  the  pharmacy  sector  and  lower  the  prices  paid  by 
consumers  for  pharmaceutical  products,  the  decree  proposes  to  expand  the  distribution 
channels of several kinds of drug (included in the “Fascia C” category) in municipalities with 
more than 15,000 inhabitants, and to allow discounts to be applied freely to the prices of all 
products  sold  in  pharmacies  and  approved  retail  outlets.  These  measures  go  some  way 
towards increasing competition in the system. The sector’s liberalization could be advanced 
by the adoption of measures allowing the number of pharmacies in Italy to be increased. 
In  the  rail,  air  and  sea  transport  sector,  which  remains  among  those  least  exposed  to 
competition, provision is made for the adoption of a set of measures, to be implemented via 
governmental regulations, designed to achieve full liberalization. A key element of the new 
sector regulations is the creation of an independent authority, whose proposed functions and 
powers respond to the need to ensure it can regulate the sector effectively.   
The  liberalization  measures  should  be  extended  to  other  sectors  that  are  only  moderately 
exposed to competition, such as urban mobility and postal services.  
Additional measures to foster competition. – The decree establishes important principles 
regarding  the  freedom  of  economic  initiative  and  the  limits  and  procedures  of  state 
regulation. Moreover, it abrogates, with immediate effect, a series of restrictions on engaging 
in economic activities. 
The  abolition  of  the  regulatory  agency  for  postal  services  and  the  national  agency  that 
regulates  and  supervises  water  services,  and  the  transfer  of  their  functions  to  existing 
authorities, goes some way towards achieving more effective sector regulation insofar as it 
ensures greater independence of the regulator. 
Measures  for  industrial  development.  –  The  decree  contains  measures  to  support 
innovation and bolster policies facilitating firms’ access to credit. On the innovation side, it 
expands  the  range  of  investments  that  qualify  for  support  under  the  Revolving  Fund  to 
Support Enterprises and Research Investment; in particular, it provides for the inclusion of 
industrial innovation projects, an area where Italy’s shortcomings are especially marked by 
European  standards.  Regarding  access  to  credit,  the  Guarantee  Fund  for  Small-  and 
Medium-sized  Enterprises  is  strengthened,  first  by  being  refinanced,  and  second,  by 
modifying  how  it  works,  thereby  attenuating  the  risks  associated  with  the  tighter  lending 
standards  businesses  and  banks  anticipate  in  the  coming  months,  and  lessening  the 
operational  difficulties  the  Fund  is  experiencing  owing  to  the  large  number  of  requests  for 
guarantees  received  in  recent  years.  These  measures  confirm  the  central  role  which  this 
instrument has played in facilitating access to credit from the onset of the crisis.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
The implementation of infrastructure projects. – The decree contains several measures 
aimed  at  simplifying  and  speeding  up  the  implementation  of  infrastructure  projects.  In 
particular, by strengthening the powers of the Ministry for Infrastructure and Transport, the 
criteria  and  procedures  for  identifying  strategic  works  are  rationalized  and  simplified,  the 
approval  procedure  streamlined,  and  powers  to  verify  the  progress  of  works  introduced. 
There  are  plans  to  encourage  greater  involvement  by  private  capital  in  the  realization  of 
public  works  and  to  increase  recourse  to  public-private  partnerships.  Measures  are 
introduced to make tender procedures more efficient by centralizing orders and to facilitate 
the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises.  
Overall, the measures are consistent with the objectives of speeding up the procedures and 
achieving  greater  involvement  of  private  capital  in  the  implementation  of  infrastructure. 
However, the proper use of public-private partnerships requires safeguards to guarantee the 
clear  and  efficient  allocation  of  risks  and  careful  monitoring  of  projects’  day-to-day 
management.  It  is  also  important  to  ensure  there  are  adequate  technical  skills  at  local 
government level to guarantee pursuit of the public interest. 
Interventions  in  the  banking  system.  –  The  decree  law  includes  measures  to  ease 
tensions  in  the  banking  system  stemming  from  the  sovereign  debt  crisis.  Under  one 
provision,  Italian  banks  can  benefit  from  a  state  guarantee  for  their  liabilities  at  least  until 
June 2012. The Italian government must intervene to enable banks to raise the funds needed 
to  finance  loans  to  firms  and  households.  The  procedures  for  benefiting  from  state 
guarantees are set out in accordance with the European Commission recommendations on 
the application of the rules on state aid to measures supporting banks in the context of the 
financial  crisis.  The  measure  has  no  effect  on  net  borrowing  or,  until  such  time  as  the 
guarantee is executed, general government debt. To qualify, banks must meet requirements 
drawn  up  in  a  way  that  ensures  the  guarantee  is  provided  only  to  financially  sound 
intermediaries experiencing temporary liquidity problems. The decree specifies the liabilities 
that are covered by the guarantee, to prevent it from being extended to the entire stock of 
bank liabilities.

(1) Based on official estimates. – (2) The decree provides for an increase of 2 percentage points in the standard 
and reduced VAT rates with effect from October 2012. If implementing the delegated powers for tax and social 
security reform or the related safeguard clause does not produce €13.1 billion of additional revenue in 2013 and 
€16.4 billion in 2014, the increase in the two VAT rates will become permanent and there will be a further increase 
of half a percentage point in both.
