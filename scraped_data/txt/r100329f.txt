Philip  Lowe:  Recent  developments 
economies 
Speech by Mr Philip Lowe, Assistant Governor (Economic) of the Reserve Bank of Australia, 
at the Australian Industry Group 10th Annual Economic Forum, Sydney, 25 March 2010. 
in  the  global  and  Australian 
 Thank you for the invitation to speak this morning. I am very pleased to be able to continue 
the  long-standing  relationship  between  the  Reserve  Bank  of  Australia  and  the  Australian 
Industry Group. Over the years, we have found this relationship very valuable and I hope and 
trust that this will continue. 
This morning, I would like to talk about some of the recent developments in both the world 
and Australian economies and the implications of these developments for the outlook for the 
Australian economy.  
The world economy  
The world economy is gradually recovering from the worst downturn since World War II. This 
recovery though is occurring on two different tracks (Graph 1). As a group, the G7 countries 
are experiencing only relatively weak growth, especially when viewed against the very large 
contraction  in  output  that  occurred.  In  contrast,  the  picture  in  Asia  is  quite  different,  with 
many of the economies in the region having had near V-shaped recoveries. There has also 
been  a  reasonably  solid  bounce  back  in  some  other  parts  of  the  world  with,  for  example, 
Brazil growing quite strongly over the past year.

This two-speed world is evident not just in the GDP data but also in the unemployment and 
inflation data. 
Unemployment rates in both the United States and the euro area are around 10 per cent and 
a sustained reduction still looks some time off (Graph 2).  In contrast, unemployment rates 
are now clearly falling in Asia and are much lower than in the major advanced economies.

 In  terms  of  inflation,  in  both  the  United  States  and  the  euro  area,  core  measures  are  still 
trending down, and they are likely to continue doing so for some time yet (Graph 3). Again, in 
contrast, core rates have clearly bottomed in Asia and now look to be rising in a number of 
countries in the region.

 Rather  than  run  through  more  of  the  recent  economic  data,  I  would  like  to  touch on  three 
broad issues that are likely to play a major role in shaping how the world economy evolves 
over  the  next  few  years.  The  first  of  these  is  the  need  for  the  advanced  economies  to 
consolidate their public finances. The second is the realignment of capital flows, given the 
likelihood of an extended period of low interest rates in the advanced economies. And the 
third is the challenge of increasing domestic demand in Asia. 
Public finances 
(i) 
Of  these  three  issues,  the  one  that  has  attracted  the  most  attention  recently  is  public 
finances. This is partly the result of what has been going on in Greece but, more broadly, it 
reflects  the  difficult  fiscal  positions  in  which  many  advanced  economies  currently  find 
themselves. In the United States, the federal budget deficit for 2009 was around 10 per cent 
2 
 BIS Review 37/2010
of GDP. In Japan, the deficit was almost as large, and for the euro area as a whole it was 
around  6 per  cent,  with  some  euro  area  countries  having  much  larger  deficits  than  this 
average. Furthermore, these large deficits come after three decades over which the ratio of 
public debt to GDP for the G7 economies as a whole trended higher (Graph 4). They also 
come  at  a  time  when  there  will  be  significant  medium-term  budget  pressures  due  to  the 
ageing of the population.

Over  coming  years,  many  governments  will  need  to  take  significant steps  to  improve  their 
public finances. The flexibility that they have to determine the timing and size of these steps 
is limited by the fact that they went into the current downturn with already high levels of debt. 
As a result of the poor starting points, many are now treading a fairly narrow path. On the 
one hand, tightening fiscal policy in the very near term risks derailing the recovery, while not 
doing so risks a damaging loss of confidence. 
How  these  risks  are  managed  is  likely  to  have  a  major  effect  on  how  the  world  economy 
evolves over the next few years. Presumably, what is required is for the affected countries to 
have credible medium-term fiscal consolidation strategies. While this is easier to say than to 
do, ensuring the confidence of investors is an important ingredient if the recovery is to be 
sustained. 
Capital flows 
(ii) 
This brings me to the second, but related, issue – that of capital flows. 
Most of the advanced economies are currently operating well below full capacity and, given 
the subdued nature of the recovery, it is likely to be some time before this excess capacity is 
wound back. One consequence is that, provided inflation expectations remain well anchored, 
official interest rates in these economies – which are currently at historically low levels – are 
likely  to  remain  below  average  for  a  considerable  period  of  time  (Graph 5).  In  contrast, 
elsewhere, including in Asia and Australia where growth is stronger, interest rates are likely 
to be relatively higher. This interest differential is likely to lead to a flow of capital from the 
major advanced economies to Asia and other better-performing areas of the world.

 In  Asia,  concerns  are  already  emerging  about  the  implications  of  this.  In  particular,  some 
countries are worried about the potential for volatile capital flows to be destabilising for their 
economies.  The  concern  is  that  capital  inflows  in  the  near  term  will  later  turn  into  capital 
outflows when interest rates in the advanced economies do eventually normalise, and that 
this  could  be  disruptive.  As  a  way  of  insuring  themselves  against  this  risk,  some  central 
banks continue to accumulate foreign reserves. A number of countries in the region are also 
concerned about the effects of capital inflows on their domestic banking systems, with some 
having taken steps to rein in bank lending growth, particularly in cases where property prices 
are increasing strongly. 
A related consideration is the effect of these capital flows on exchange rates in the region. In 
general, there is considerably less tolerance for large movements in exchange rates in many 
of these countries than there is in Australia. In our own case, movements in the value of the 
Australian dollar are largely seen to be a stabilising force for the economy. There is also a 
general acceptance of the view that, over the next few years, our real exchange rate is likely 
to be higher than the average over the past decade or so. In contrast, in much of Asia, where 
international trade shares are considerably higher than in Australia, movements in exchange 
rates tend to be viewed with more concern, particularly when they are seen to be driven by 
speculative capital flows. 
One  other  related  consideration  is  the  impact  on  asset  markets  around  the  world  of  an 
extended  period  of  low  official  interest  rates  in  the  major  advanced  economies.  When  the 
global economy was in this situation around five years ago things did not work out well. While 
the  current  environment  is  very  different  from  that  in  the  middle  of  the  2000s,  this  earlier 
experience  suggests  that  we  need  to  watch  the  financial  side  of  the  global  economy  very 
carefully, particularly when interest rates are unusually low. 
Domestic demand in Asia 
(iii) 
The third issue I would like to touch on is the growth of domestic demand in Asia. 
For some decades, many countries in Asia have had a growth strategy focused on exports. 
Given  the  strong  growth  in  consumption  in  the  major  western  economies,  this  strategy 
worked. However, many of the countries in Asia recognise that given the subdued outlook for 
the  advanced  economies,  there  will  now  need  to  be  a  stronger  emphasis  on  growth  in 
domestic demand than has been the case in the past.  
China provides a good example here. Over the past two decades, the share of household 
consumption in Chinese GDP has declined from just under 50 per cent to 35 per cent – a 
4 
 BIS Review 37/2010
very low level by international standards. This decline reflects two broad developments. The 
first is a reduction in the share of national income going to households; in the early 1990s, 
this share stood at nearly 70 per cent, but by late 2008, it had fallen to less than 60 per cent 
(Graph 6). The second factor is an increase in the household saving rate; in the early 1990s, 
around 30 per cent of household income was saved, while today this share is close to 40 per 
cent.

In  China,  as  in  many  parts  of  Asia,  there  is  now  a  recognition  that  policies  to  promote 
consumption  are  likely  to  play  a  more  important  role  than  was  previously  the  case.  In  the 
past,  strong  consumption  growth  was  often  seen  as  something  that  would  follow  strong 
exports, rather than be a driver of the economy itself. This view is gradually changing and 
this is leading to an increased focus on structural reforms to increase the share of national 
income  going  to  the  household  sector  and  to  reduce  the  household  saving  rate.  While 
reforms in these areas can be difficult, they are important if Asia, as a whole, is to continue to 
grow strongly in the face of subdued demand for exports from the region. 
How  things  play  out  in  each  of  these  three  areas  –  public-sector  debt,  capital  flows  and 
structural policies in Asia – will have a significant impact on the global environment in which 
the Australian economy finds itself over the year ahead. As the Reserve Bank has spelt out a 
number of times recently, our central scenario is a relatively positive one. The economies in 
Asia are expected to continue growing reasonably solidly, while the advanced economies are 
expected  to  have  only  a  subdued  recovery,  weighed  down  by  the  need  to  consolidate 
balance sheets in both the household and public sectors. Around this central scenario there 
are,  however,  clearly  risks,  particularly  associated  with  the  three  issues  that  I  have  just 
touched on.  
Given these risks, one question is how should policy be set? The Reserve Bank’s general 
approach  has  been  to  proceed  on  the  basis  of  the  central  scenario,  but  be  prepared  to 
respond if things turn out differently, as we did in late 2008 when the global outlook took a 
marked turn for the worse. The alternative of waiting to see how the myriad of risks evolves 
before  adjusting  policy  runs  the  significant  downside  of  moving  too  late,  particularly  given 
that the economy is starting this upswing with less spare capacity than in previous upswings. 
Fortunately, in Australia we have had the policy flexibility to respond to changing events as 
they have occurred and this has served us well.

The Australian economy  
I would now like to turn more specifically to the Australian economy, where the run of data 
over the past few months has tended to be on the firm side. Employment growth has been 
robust, business and consumer confidence is above average, the housing market has been 
strong,  and  there  are  signs  that  the  period  of  business  deleveraging  is  coming  to  an  end 
(Graph 7). Collectively, these outcomes provide us with some confidence that the economy 
is now in a reasonably solid upswing.

 Over  the  course  of  this  year,  the  nature  of  this  upswing  is,  however,  likely  to  change 
somewhat. Recently, the overall level of spending in Australia has been supported by strong 
growth in public-sector demand. This has occurred at a time when growth in private-sector 
demand has been relatively weak (Graph 8). As we move into the second half of 2010, this 
configuration is likely to change. Public-sector investment is projected to decline, particularly 
as spending on the Federal Government’s school building program tails off. But moving in 
the  other  direction,  private-sector  business  investment  is  expected  to  strengthen  further, 
particularly in the resources sector.

This expected rise in business investment is underpinned by the strong outlook for the terms 
of  trade.  Recently,  the  spot  prices  of  iron  ore  and  coal  have  risen,  and  the  prices  that 
exporters  will  receive  over  the  next  year  look  likely  to  be  substantially  higher  than  those 
received over the past year (Graph 9). As a result, a significant rise in the terms of trade is 
expected over the year ahead. While movements in the terms of trade do not get the same 
high-frequency attention as many of the monthly economic indicators, history suggests that 
they have a large influence on how the overall economy performs. Among other things, they 
can  affect  the  investment  climate,  the  government’s  budget  position,  asset  values,  overall 
confidence in the economy and the growth of domestic incomes.

 In  contrast  to  the  terms  of  trade,  one  area  that  does  get  high-frequency  attention  is  the 
property market. Over recent times, most indicators of conditions in the established housing 
market  have  been  very  buoyant.  Auction  clearance  rates  have  been  high  and  nationwide 
measures of housing prices have been increasing by around 1 per cent a month, with prices 
in Melbourne rising at an even faster pace (Graph 10). The rental market also remains quite 
tight, with rents having risen firmly and vacancy rates low.

 There are, however, a few contrary signs to this generally strong picture. Total housing loan 
approvals declined in October, November, December and January, with the declines broader 
than just for first-home buyers following the scaling back of the additional grants (Graph 11). 
Some  lenders  have  also  tightened  terms  and  conditions,  including  by  further  reducing 
maximum  loan-to-valuation  ratios  (LVRs).  And  in  the  lower-priced  suburbs  of  the  capital 
cities,  housing  prices  have  broadly  moved  sideways  since  October,  after  earlier  significant 
rises.

Looking forward, it is too early to tell whether these contrary signs indicate that some cooling 
in  the  property  market  is  in  prospect.  It  is,  however,  clearly  desirable  to  avoid  significant 
imbalances developing in the housing market, both in terms of the supply-demand situation 
and the price and financing dynamics. The pick-up in dwelling construction that is occurring 
will be helpful here, although further increases are likely to be needed over the medium term. 
On  the  financing  side, we  are  currently  not  seeing  the  type  of  financial  developments  that 
caused concern in 2002 and 2003 when maximum LVRs were being raised, loan servicing 
requirements were being eased, new types of mortgage products were being introduced, and 
risk spreads were being compressed. This is good news, as it would obviously be unhelpful if 
8 
 BIS Review 37/2010
a speculative cycle were to emerge on the back of the recent strength in housing prices. This 
is an area that lenders and current and prospective home owners will need to watch carefully 
over the months ahead. 
The final topic that I would like to touch on briefly is inflation. 
Here  things  have  proceeded  pretty  much  as  expected.  In  underlying  terms,  inflation  has 
moderated significantly, and the year-ended rate is expected to decline from its current rate 
of around 3¼ per cent to around 2½ per cent over the course of 2010. This decline is being 
underpinned by the sharp slowing in wage growth in the private sector that we saw over the 
past year and the appreciation of the exchange rate. In addition, the Reserve Bank’s liaison 
with  retailers  suggests  that  there  has  been  significant  discounting  recently,  and  business 
surveys point to below average price increases. 
As we move forward, we need to ensure that inflation pressures remain contained and that 
inflation expectations remain well anchored. Expansion of the supply side of the economy is 
obviously important here. So too is addressing potential bottlenecks and ensuring that our 
labour  and  capital  markets  are  sufficiently  flexible  so  that  resources  are  able  to  move  to 
where they are most productive. In addition, as the Bank has noted a number of times, with 
the economy having relatively limited spare capacity, it is likely that interest rates will need to 
continue their gradual move towards more normal levels. 
Conclusion  
In  summary  then,  our  central  scenario  is  for  the  world  economy  to  grow  at  around  an 
average  pace  over  the  next  couple  of  years,  with  strong  growth  in  a  number  of  our  major 
trading partners in Asia. However, around this central scenario there are significant risks as 
the flow-on effects of the events of the past 18 months continue to reverberate around the 
global  economy.  While  we  need  to  watch  these  flow-on  effects  carefully,  the  outlook  for 
Australia appears to be considerably brighter than that for most other advanced economies.  
Thank you.
