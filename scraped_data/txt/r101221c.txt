1. 
World economy 
Although the underlying recovery of the world economy is still on track, there seems little sign 
of  any  narrowing  of  the  gap  between  the  advanced  countries  and  the  newly  emerging 
countries in what has been termed the two-speed global recovery1. 
 
(USA)  The  macroeconomic  policy  stance  of  pump  priming  activity  has  been 
maintained for example by means of QE2, and the scale of the increase in facilities 
investment has widened because of the upturn in firms’ profitability. 
–  We  are  unlikely,  however,  to  see  any  great  strengthening  of  the  recovery 
momentum as a recovery in the labor and housing markets is yet to be seen 
while improvements in the saving rate continues. 
  
(China) Shrugging-off the mildness of the recovery in the advanced countries, the 
Chinese economy has maintained its strong growth trend on the basis for domestic 
demand  in  line  with  the  large  scale  of  the  rise  in  incomes  and  the  measures2  to 
promote consumption.

2  Payments to assist in the purchase of white goods are expected to be made up until January 2013 and, in 
accordance  with  the  new  economic  plan  for  2011–2015,  social  security  expenditures  are  likely  to  e  greatly 
increased to safeguard public welfare.

 Consumer prices and asset prices seem set to show unstable movements as 
the increase in liquidity by way of foreign capital inflows comes on top of the 
demand pressures from the high growth rates. 
  
The major economic forecasting institutes are predicting that the rate of growth of 
the world economy will be a little above 4% in 2011 and around 4 1/2% in 2012. 
Global financial markets 
Globally, credit conditions are forecast to continue their improving trends owing mainly to the 
accommodative monetary policy stance of the major advanced countries. 
 
For  the  US  and  the  eurozone,  bank  lending  has  shifted  to  an  increase  since  this 
September. 
The other side of the coin is that global financial market uncertainty is on the rise because of 
euro area’s debt problems and additional quantitative easing.

 BIS Review 172/2010
  (Euro area debt problems) Despite the funding support from the EU and the IMF, 
the  sovereign  debt  problems  of  certain  EU  member  states  are  likely  to  act  as  a 
factor making for market unrest for a considerable time to come. 
– 
If  eurozone  debt  problems  do  worsen,  there  is  the  possibility  that  the  credit 
risk  of  newly  emerging  market  countries  would  also  increase  owing  to  a 
strengthened preference for safe haven assets. 
(QE2)  The  global  financial  markets  are  likely  to  react  extremely  sensitively  to  the 
direction  of  the  US  Fed’s  monetary  policy  ahead  of  the  expiry  of  the  second 
quantitative easing at the end of next June. 
– 
Market  attention  may  well  focus  on  whether  or  not  there  will  be  further 
quantitative easing (QE3).3 
 Commodity markets 
International oil prices are forecast to maintain their upward trend in line with the continued 
recovery of the world economy and the increase in global liquidity. 
 
Next year demand for crude is likely to surpass supply albeit only by a small margin, 
led by the emerging market countries (+500,000bpd). 
– 
The fact that the OECD countries’ oil inventories are now at their highest level 
since 2005 will act as a factor limiting the scale of upward movement in the oil 
price. 
Global  liquidity,  which  has  expanded  greatly  in  line  with  QE2,  could  put  upward 
pressure on oil prices if it feeds through into commodity markets.

In  the  announcement  of  the  Federal  Reserve’s  FOMC  for  November,  mention  is  made  of  the  possibility  of 
additional steps in accordance with future economic activity.

 Domestic conditions 
2. 
Fiscal spending 
Budgetary expenditures next year will be increased 6.0% over this year (260 trillion won) to 
276 trillion won while for the year 2012 there will be a 4.0% increase to 287 trillion won. 
 
The extent of the front-loading of fiscal spending during the first half of 2011 will be 
gradually scaled back so that around 2012 it will be back to its pre-crisis level.4 
The ratio of the fiscal deficit to GDP will decline from 1.9% this year to 1.6% in 2011 as tax 
revenues increase5. 
 
The sovereign debt ratio will decline from 36.1% this year to 35.1% next year. 
                                                  
4  For the years 2004–07, the front loading of expenditures during the  first half averaged 53.7%. 
5  The government intends to achieve a balanced budget by 2013 or 2014.

 BIS Review 172/2010
Household consumption 
Household purchasing power is forecast to expand thanks to higher incomes resulting from 
the continued economic upswing. 
 
Households are also expected to become more consumption-minded.  
– 
Share  prices,  which  form  a  leading  indicator  of  consumer  sentiment,  have 
risen strongly since this September.6 
Having  said  this,  the  worsening  of  the  terms  of  trade,  could  act  as  a  factor  limiting  the 
increase in consumption. 
 Corporate investment 
Even in 2011, conditions for corporate investment are expected to present a comparatively 
favorable  picture  as  growth  trends  are  maintained  in  major  branches  of  industry  while 
capacity utilization rates run at high levels. 
 
World  demand  for  IT  products  and  cars  is  increasing  continually  while  domestic 
demand is also buoyant owing to the effect of new products such as smartphones. 
Construction investment, though, is likely to remain sluggish. 
 
In the housing market, although there is some likelihood of private sector housing 
construction  picking  up  as  it  shows  signs  of  shaking  off  its  long  time  torpor,  the 
public sector, for its part, is predicted to present a subdued picture in line with this 
year’s large-scale reduction in permits issued.

It is estimated that the rise in share prices during the first three quarters of this year added some 44 trillion 
won to the stock of financial assets.

Main assumptions & economic outlook 
Main assumptions of the forecasts 
1. 
The growth of the world economy next year is set at 4.0%, reflecting the economic conditions 
in major countries (4.3% in 2012). 
The rate of the expansion of world trade is assumed to be 6.7% (7.3%in 2012). 
The price of a barrel of crude oil (annualized average) is set at USD 87 per barrel (USD 90 in 
2012).

Economic outlook 
2. 
Growth 
The GDP growth rate in 2011 is forecast to register 4.5%.  
 
In terms of each half year, it is expected to accelerate over the course of the year, 
running at 3.8% in the first half and 5.0% in the latter half. 
For 2012, it is forecast to rise to 4.7%. 
 
Let us now look at the details of growth next year by sectors of expenditure. 
 
Private consumption is predicted to increase constantly in line with the expansion in 
household purchasing power (4.1% in 2011 and 4.3% in 2012). 
Facilities  investment,  similarly,  should  mark  a  solidly-based  upward  trend,  but  the 
scale of its increase is expected to narrow owing to the completion this year of the 
majority  of  investment  projects  held  over  because  of  the  financial  crisis  (6.5%  in 
2011 and 6.3% 2012). 
Construction investment is expected to stage no more than a slight increase (1.4% 
in 2011 and 1.3% in 2012). 
Exports  are  forecast  to  continue  on  their  strongly  upward  track,  boosted  by  the 
advanced  countries’  sustained  recovery  mode  and  the  strong  growth  being 
registered in the newly emerging countries (9.6% in 2011 and 12.5% in 2012). 
   Outlook for economic growth 
 Employment 
The number of persons in employment is forecast to rise by 260,000 in 2011 and by 280,000 
in 2012. 
 
 
The unemployment rate should drop from 3.8% this year to around 3.5% next year. 
BIS Review 172/2010

Prices 
Consumer  price  inflation  is  seen  to  accelerate  to  3.5%  in  2011  and  to  rise  about  3.2%  in 
2012. 
 
The rate of core inflation, similarly, will edge up above 3% from next year. 
 Current account 
The current account surplus for 2011 is expected to narrow in scale from this year's 29 billion 
dollars to 18 billion dollars. 
 
For 2012 it is forecast to be around 16 billion dollars.

Overall assessment & policy tasks 
III.  
Overall assessment 
1. 
 
Next year’s GDP growth rate of 4.5% will be at the trend level7. 
The  trend  of  an  increase  in  economic  activity  should  continue  as  next  year’s  Q4 
growth (year-on-year) is projected at 5.6%, well above this year’s 4.8%. 
  In terms of expenditure sectors, domestic demand and exports are likely to act as 
twin  sources  of  growth  owing  to  the  strengthening  of  private  consumption  and 
facilities investment. 
– 
The  net  growth  contribution  of  domestic  demand8  will  be  2.5%  and  that  of 
exports 2.0%. 
o 
The  government’s  net  growth  contribution  will  be  at  the  level  of 
0.7 percentage  point, 
year 
(2001~07 average: 0.7%p).  
in  an  average 
same  as 
the 
                                                 
7  This year’s 6.1% figure was greatly influenced by the base-period effect during the course of overcoming the 
global financial crisis. 
8  The figures are calculated first by computing the scale of imports induced by domestic demand and exports 
using the import generation coefficient of the industrial input-output tables by sectors. The scale of imports is 
then subtracted from the relevant sector. 
 BIS Review 172/2010 
 9
 The  perceived  level  of  economic  activity  is  expected  to  improve  further  as  the 
growth  contribution  of  domestic  demand  increases,  but  it  is  likely  to  be  difficult  to 
narrow significantly its differential from the actual level of economic activity. 
– 
The rate of increase of gross domestic income (GDI) will trail that of economic 
growth because of the worsening of the terms of trade. 
 
In the labor market, the trend of improvement will be maintained with a private-sector-
2. 
led increase in the number of persons employed and a fall in the unemployment rate. 
 
Having  said  that,  the  degree  of  improvement  in  qualitative  terms  will  be  checked 
somewhat by the feebleness of large businesses in the creation of what are seen as 
“decent jobs”9. 
Consumer prices are expected to stay on a rising track for quite some time, carrying 
3. 
over from the 3 1/2% level for this quarter. 
                                                 
9  Even as the number of persons employed in the private sector increased by a total of 382,000 running up to 
October of this year, that of large corporations decreased by 49,000. 
 10 
 BIS Review 172/2010
   Demand  pressures  are  being  built up  from  the  sustained  rise  in  economic  activity 
and international commodity prices, wages and rental charges are all on the rise. 
The accelerated upward trend of Chinese wages and prices may also act as a cost 
push factor for domestic prices by way of higher import prices. 
Expected inflation, which has been on the rise since the beginning of this year, will 
affect prices after some time lag. 
The  current  account  will  retain  its  underlying  surplus  but  the  scale  of  this  surplus  is 
4. 
seen  to  shrink  owing  to  the  expansion  of  imports  drawn  in  by  the  strengthened  recovery 
momentum of domestic demand. 
 
The ratio of the current account surplus to GDP will drop from this year’s 3% level to 
below 2.0% but above 1.5% in 2011. 
  
5. 
These  economic  forecasts  for  2011  are  attended  by  a  considerable  degree  of 
uncertainty. Domestically, there are the geopolitical risks following the North Korean attack 
on Yeonpyeongdo. Externally, the unknowns include the sovereign debt problems of the euro 
area, price instability in China, and the direction of the US Fed’s monetary policy post-QE2. 
BIS Review 172/2010

Policy tasks 
1.  While the Korean economy will stay on a solid growth track in 2011, political initiatives 
should  be  directed  toward  raising  the  living  conditions  of  the  public  at  large  including  the 
boosting of purchasing power by way of price stability and the creation of “decent jobs”, given 
the persistent gap between public perceptions of the level of economic activity and the actual 
numbers. 
2.  Great  care must  be  taken  to  avoid an  enfeebling  influence  on  the  domestic  financial 
and  foreign  exchange  markets  and  on  real  economic  activity  from  the  eurozone  debt 
problems, Chinese inflation and the Fed’s monetary policy course post-QE2. 
3. 
In  order  to  respond  to  an  increase  in  the  level  of  uncertainty  of  the  external 
environment,  a  policy  mix  should  be  devised  that  emphasizes  the  twin  growth  pillars  of 
domestic demand and exports.
