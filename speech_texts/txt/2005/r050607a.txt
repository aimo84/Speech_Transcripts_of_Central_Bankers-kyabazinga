Jean-Pierre Roth: More growth a must 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Swiss 
National Bank, at the Swiss Economic Forum, Thun, 27 May 2005. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 Since the mid-1970s now, economic growth in Switzerland has been significantly lower than that of 
other industrialised nations. In terms of per capita GDP among OECD countries, Switzerland lost its 
leading position during this time, falling back into the main field. Economic growth is vital, however, for 
the  sustainability  of  our  social  security  institutions.  Demographic  shifts  will  cause  the  ratio  of 
pensioners to contributors to double in the next 30 years, with the result that tomorrow’s generation 
will be faced with a heavy burden – one that could be considerably lightened by higher growth rates. 
The  soft  growth  in  Switzerland  is  primarily  attributable  to  the  lack  of  competition  in  the  domestic 
market.  There  are  numerous  known  ways  to  boost  growth  which  have  proven  successful  in  many 
other  countries.  So  far,  however,  Switzerland  unfortunately  has  neither  grasped  the  importance  of 
implementing these measures, nor does it have the political will to do so. Stronger economic growth 
can only be achieved by opening our domestic market to competition, contributing to the attractiveness 
of Switzerland as a business centre and strengthening our human capital. The necessary reforms will 
call  for  short-term  sacrifices  from  all  walks  of  life,  such  as  the  relinquishment  of  protection  and 
privileges. However, the long-term gains in wealth for the country at large will more than compensate 
for these short-term difficulties.
