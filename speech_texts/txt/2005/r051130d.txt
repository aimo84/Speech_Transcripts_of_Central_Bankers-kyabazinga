 The hedge fund industry has grown rapidly over the past few years and it has become an important 
segment of global financial markets. The possibility to use leverage and a high degree of flexibility are 
key elements of a broad range of investment strategies which have made the hedge funds industry 
very  profitable.  Hedge  funds  have  been  an  important  source  of  innovation  in  the  traditional  asset 
management industry and they have rendered financial markets more liquid, more efficient and more 
flexible. Nonetheless, the rapid growth of the industry and the excessive use of leverage may result in 
potential systemic risks which are relevant to central banks, unlike prudential matters. Overall, industry 
leverage is difficult to measure. However, several studies suggest that it is lower than at the time of 
the near collapse of LTCM in 1998. Even so, temporary excessive levels of leverage with single hedge 
funds can not be ruled out completely. A crisis in the hedge fund industry might therefore spill over to 
their primary trading partners, the major investment banks. Hence, regulation and supervision in order 
to  minimize  systemic  risk  should  concentrate  on  the  leading  global  investment  banks  to  make sure 
that adequate counterparty and liquidity risk management systems and processes are implemented. 
Against the backdrop of scarce resources, we should refrain from opening new regulatory fields which 
are not relevant for systemic risks.
