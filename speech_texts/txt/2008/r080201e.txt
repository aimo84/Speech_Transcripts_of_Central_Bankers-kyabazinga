Thomas Jordan: Monetary policy and financial markets – what may we 
expect in 2008? 
Summary of a speech by Mr Thomas Jordan, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss 
National Bank, at the Messe Fonds 2008, Zurich, 31 January 2008. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 The  problems  linked  to  the  US  housing  and  mortgage  market  dominated  international 
financial markets in 2007. Despite the difficulties on the financial markets in the second half 
of  the  year,  the  global  economy  was  robust  last  year.  For  2008,  the  outlook  for  global 
economic growth has deteriorated and become more uncertain. 
The  turbulence  in  the  financial  sector  led  to  a  considerable  increase  in  risk  premiums  in 
2007. In the past few years, these premiums had been very low, and even after the recent 
increase  they  remain  modest  by  historic  standards.  Due  to  the  higher  level  of  economic 
uncertainty  in  2008,  the  process  of  adjustment  in  risk  premiums  looks  set  to  continue  in 
various markets.  
From the current standpoint, the Swiss National Bank anticipates a somewhat slower pace of 
growth for Switzerland in 2008, although the economy should remain robust. However, the 
risks  have  increased  in  the  recent  period.  As  a  result  of  the  oil  price  hikes,  inflation  in 
Switzerland is likely to rise above 2% in the first half of 2008. Despite raised stock exchange 
volatility, the SNB does not judge that any additional actions are necessary at present. The 
quarterly assessment in mid-March 2008 will provide the opportunity to assess the inflation 
and economic outlook on the basis of new data.
