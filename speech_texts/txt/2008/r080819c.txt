Ewart S Williams: The impact of global events on the Caribbean 
economies 
Address by Mr Ewart S Williams, Governor of the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, at 
the ICATT 26th Annual Caribbean Conference, Port-of-Spain, 27 June 2008. 
 Thanks for inviting me to participate in this very timely discussion focusing on the growing 
complexity  of  the  economic  and  business  environment  and  the  implications  for  the 
economies in the Caribbean.  
I  often  hear  accountants  refer  to  the  challenges  posed  by  the  new  benchmarks  in  their 
profession,  like  the  IFRS,  for  example.  These  challenges  have  forced  them  to  continue 
upgrading your skills and, to be constantly in search of ways of adapting these standards to 
our local situation. 
Economists and policymakers are facing similar challenges as we realize that, in the current 
global environment, the traditional analyses no longer fit as well as before and the traditional 
policy prescriptions don’t seem to work as well as they once did. 
Several months ago the IMF called the financial turmoil in international markets one of the 
largest financial shocks experienced since the second World War and they forecasted 
that the crisis would reverberate globally. Almost nine months later, however, there has been 
little or almost no contagion to regional financial markets; regional economies have not been 
seriously  affected  by  any  financing  constraint  and  regional  economic  growth  remains 
relatively robust. 
A few years ago if I told you that the price of oil would rise to US$140 per barrel without dire 
worldwide  economic  consequences  you  would  have  thought  me  mad.  Yet,  the  global 
economy saw the price of a barrel of oil rise from just under US$25 at the start of this decade 
to  almost  US$100  as  at  the  end  of  2007  (Chart  1)  and  in  this  same  period  developing 
countries registered the highest growth rates in decades.  Growth  in  Latin  America  for 
instance averaged 6 per cent in the period 2002-2006, the highest for any five year period 
since the 1970s; in the same period growth in the Caribbean averaged around 5 per cent, an 
equally impressive economic performance, by historical standards (Chart 2). 
An  Economic  Review  for  the  first  quarter  published  by  the  Central  Bank  of  Barbados 
suggests  that  notwithstanding  the  rapid  increase  in  international  oil  prices  and  the  US 
slowdown,  tourism  arrivals  have  continued  to  be  strong  (in  fact  10  per  cent  up  from  last 
year). Other countries in the Caribbean, including Jamaica, report similar trends.  
Trinidad and Tobago is expected to continue to record robust growth, in part because of its 
economic structure that is heavily dependent on energy. However, projections for 2008 are 
for only a modest slowdown in the rest of the region. (Charts 3 and 4)  
Of  course,  in  most  economies,  both  developed  and  developing,  the  rapid  increase  in 
international food and other commodity prices is being reflected in an unwelcomed return 
to a high inflation environment. In the Caribbean, for instance, inflation has moved from an 
average of around 5 per cent in 2002-2006, to 6.8 per cent in 2007, and is expected to reach 
close to double digits in 2008 (Charts 5 and 6). 
Some countries are doing worse than others (on the inflation front). In Jamaica, for instance, 
headline inflation for the 12-month period ended March 2008 was 20 per cent; here at home, 
our  latest  data  show  headline  inflation  at  10  per  cent  and  an  IMF  mission  that  just  left 
Barbados projected a rise in inflation to 9 per cent this year from 4 per cent last year. Inflation 
in  the  ECCU  which  generally  hovered  at  around  2-3  percent  is  now  around  6.1  per  cent 
(Chart 6).

Against  this  background  (and  allowing  for  the  inflation  surge),  the  question  that  I 
would like to pose is, why are the global economic conditions not putting a greater 
damper on the region?  
I can point to three main factors: 
• 
The first, is the on-going shift to a multi-polar world with the reduced reliance 
on  the  United  States  as  the  engine  of  the  global  economy.  In  fact,  there  is  an 
interesting paradox here... and it is that the US downturn would be a lot steeper 
but  for  the  resilience  of  some  of  the  emerging  market  and  developing 
countries.  It  is  the  export  sector  and  the  depreciation  of  the  US  dollar  that  is 
maintaining some momentum in the US economy. 
The  multi-polar  world  is  relevant  to  the  resilience  of  the  regional  economies  in 
several ways: 
1. 
2. 
As you know, many countries in the Caribbean are heavily dependent on 
tourism… what has happened in the region over the past few years is that 
there has been a geographical diversification in the source of tourist 
arrivals – with the US share declining and that of Europe increasing, due in 
part to the strengthening of the British pound and the Euro, (Charts 7 and 
8). The statistics also suggest that tourism from Trinidad and Tobago to the 
rest  of  the  region  has  increased  markedly,  helping  to  offset  any  global 
slowdown. 
Because of the strength of the export sector in the US, this recession or this 
slowdown  (however  you  call  it)  has  not  been  as  costly  in  terms  of 
employment  (at  least  not  yet)  as  in  previous  recessions.  And  because  of 
this, there has not been a sharp decline in emigrants remittances as 
was previously expected. (These remittances are an important source of 
domestic  demand  and  foreign  exchange  earnings  for  many  Caribbean 
countries.  I  think  in  Jamaica  remittances  are  the  major  source  of  foreign 
exchange earnings). 
(So this is the global re-balancing effect.) 
  2 
 A  second  factor  that  has  contributed  to  the  insulation  of  the  region  from  greater 
contagion has been the improved strength of the regional financial sector. It is 
now  certain  that  banks  in  the  region  have  not  been  directly  affected  by  the  sub-
prime  crisis,  because  they  have  not  held  any  of  these  assets  and  because  their 
lending  operations  have  been  based  on  the  growth  of  deposits  rather  than  on 
borrowing from foreign banks. (The credit crunch partly resulted from the fact that 
banks were no longer willing to lend to each other because they were worried about 
the extent of possible losses from US sub-prime mortgage backed securities. (This 
has not been an issue in the region.) 
More fundamentally however, since the Jamaican financial crisis of the late 1990’s, 
the  regional  banking  system  has  gone  through  a  period  of  consolidation  and 
strengthening,  reflected  in  the  increase  in  capital  and  a  sharp  reduction  in  non-
performing  loans  (Chart  9).  This  meant  that  banks  were  in  a  position  to  continue 
lending  and  supporting  domestic  activity  even  in  an  environment  of  tight  global 
liquidity (Chart 10). 
Another  important  financial  plus  for  the  region  is  this.  Previously,  when  global 
liquidity dried up, Caribbean countries were shut off from international funding and 
this impacted productive investment and sometimes forced cutbacks in government 
expenditure.  What  has  changed  is  that,  now  the  regional  governments  as  well  as 
regional corporations that have been shut out of the global markets have turned to 
BIS Review 99/2008
 the Trinidad and Tobago capital market for financing and in that way, have been 
able to maintain investment spending (Chart 11). 
A third factor that explains the better resilience of the regional economies is the fact 
(perhaps  not  sufficiently  recognized)  that  macro-economic  management  has 
improved  markedly  in  regional  economies  over  the  last  several  years.  This  is 
reflected  in  some  of  the  main  economic  parameters.  Fiscal  deficits  have  been 
reduced; public debt has declined; and net international reserves have risen sharply. 
All  these  factors  have  increased  the  resilience  of  regional  economies.  (Charts  12 
and 13) 
Let me stress that while the direct spillovers from the global financial turmoil to the regional 
economies appear to have been contained so far, I am by no means suggesting that the 
region will not feel greater effects as time goes by. Borrowing from the new jargon, I do 
not  believe  that  the  region  (as  indeed,  most  developing  countries)  has  de-coupled  or  will 
continue to be relatively un-affected by the global turmoil. 
As I noted earlier, growth in the regional economies will be slower than the average for the 
past few years, largely because of the financial turmoil and some related factors such as the 
soaring international oil prices. Moreover, policy makers throughout the region will concede 
that their economies are facing increased uncertainties and major risks. There is no doubt 
that a protracted and deep US downturn combined with a slowdown in the EU,  will surely 
affect  tourism  and  remittances  and  other  regional  exports.  The  impact  of  this  could  be 
compounded  by  monetary  tightening  to  address  inflationary  pressures.  In  turn,  a  sharp 
regional growth slowdown could threaten the stability of the financial system. So we are not 
out of the woods. 
What  does  all  this  mean  for  us  in  terms  of  economic  management?  Because  of  the 
uncertainty, countries in the region should: 
(i) 
Further  consolidate  their  fiscal  positions.  Given  Trinidad  and  Tobago’s  fortunate 
reserve endowment there is a strong case for increasing national savings. 
Continue to reduce their public debt, particularly foreign debt. Our external debt is 
pretty low and we should try to keep it that way; and 
Continue to improve its regulatory standards and adopt international best practices 
in all areas – in accounting, auditing, transparency etc. 
(ii) 
(iii) 
As I said, we are not yet out of the woods.
