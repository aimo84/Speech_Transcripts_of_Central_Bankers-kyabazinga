 Financial Stability Report No.14 (2)/2017 
Liviu Voinea, Deputy Governor 
Press conference, Bucharest, 4 December 2017 
 Your Excellences, 
Dear colleagues, 
Dear guests, 
 Thank  you  for  your  presence  at  the  launch  of  the  December  2017  issue  of  the  Financial 
Stability Report, No. 14(2)/2017. Right beside me are three NBR directors who are ready to 
answer your questions: Mr Eugen Rădulescu, director of the Financial Stability Department, 
which  prepared  the  Report  –  I  wish  to  thank  all  the  colleagues  involved;  Mr  Emil  Vonvea, 
director  of  the  Bank  Resolution  Department  –  an  area  having  the  role  to  strengthen 
confidence in the banking sector – the Report also includes a section dedicated to resolution 
strategies; and Mr Tudor Grosu, director of the Macroeconomic Modelling and Forecasting 
Department, as part of the analyses in the Report are based on scenarios and econometric 
models to the development of which his department also contributed. I would like to thank 
the other departments which cooperated in the preparation of the  Report, particularly the 
Economic Studies Department for the translation.  
This is the 14th financial stability report launched by the National Bank of Romania. I would 
like to point out that the Report we are releasing today has been discussed in two meetings 
of  the  NBR  Board  and  was  unanimously  approved  by  the  NBR  Board  in  its  meeting  of  27 
November 2017.   
The  Report  presents  the  risks  to  financial  stability,  in  close  correlation  with  domestic  and 
international  economic  developments.  Financial  stability  is  a  public  good  which  refers  not 
only  to banks,  but  also to  the economy  as  a  whole.  Financial  stability is  influenced  by the 
quality of the public policy mix.  
Since the previous Report (May 2017), financial stability has remained robust, yet we notice 
that certain vulnerabilities are still manifest or have been building up, especially with regard 
to  upward  pressures  on  the  risk  premium  for  emerging  economies,  tensions  surrounding 
domestic  macroeconomic  equilibria  stemming  from  slippages  and  uncertainty  in  the 
budgetary and fiscal policy and higher household indebtedness, the risks being compounded 
by the correlation between these factors.  
1 
 Looking at macroeconomic fundamentals, several favourable indicators are noteworthy:  
  Romania’s  major  advantage  is  the  low  public  debt  stock  (37.4  percent  of  GDP), 
together  with  the  drop  in  the  refinancing  risk,  due  mainly  to  the  extension  in  the 
maturity  of  public  debt (Figures  1  and  2).  Public  debt  spans  mostly  the medium  or 
long  term  (94  percent  of  total,  on  the  domestic  and  external  markets  alike  –  with 
domestic debt accounting for 48 percent of total or 17 percent of GDP) (Figure 3). 
  Another  advantage  for  Romania  consists  in  the  sizeable  international  reserves 
(Figure  4).  Yet,  international  reserves  play  a  preventive  role  and  they  cannot  make 
up for the structural worsening of some indicators.  
  The Romanian economy posted a high growth rate in the first nine months of 2017 
(7  percent  in  the  first  three  quarters  of  2017  versus  the  same  year-earlier  period) 
(Figure 5). 
  Unemployment rate stayed on a downward track and employment rate was stuck 
to the uptrend (Figure 6). 
Nevertheless, these developments should be read considering the widening of the structural 
government  deficit  and  the  increase  in  the  trade  deficit,  whereas  inflation  rate  returned 
quickly into the upper half of the variation band of the target and the exchange rate of the 
leu against the euro depreciated slightly since the beginning of the year. At the same time, 
the  interbank  market  rate  rose  at  an  accelerated  pace  in  September,  and  stabilised 
thereafter, amid the pick-up in annual inflation rate and the consolidation in expectations of 
an  adjustment  in  the  monetary  policy  stance,  coupled  with  the  decline  in  the  structural 
liquidity surplus under the simultaneous influence of the main autonomous liquidity factors, 
namely  operations  in  the  Treasury  account  and  non-residents’  transactions  on  the  local 
financial market.  
As  for  the  banking  sector,  key  financial  and  prudential  indicators  have  further  posted  a 
robust performance. In the assessment conducted by the EBA, the indicators are in the low-
risk bucket in terms of capitalisation, coverage by provisions, profitability, and balance sheet 
structure;  in  the  medium-risk  bucket  in  terms  of  asset  quality  and  operational  efficiency; 
and in the high-risk bucket as regards restructuring measures (Figure 8).  
Solvency  indicators  continued  to  stand  at  adequate  levels  and  the  substantial  capital 
reserves relative to prudential requirements provide a good capacity to absorb unexpected 
losses and resources to ensure lending to the real sector (Figure 10). Stress test results for 
the  banking  sector  reveal  the  resilience  of  the  sector  as  a  whole  in  case  adverse 
macroeconomic scenarios materialise, yet the impact of the interest rate risk on the banking 
sector is notable, owing to the balance sheet structure featuring longer asset duration. The 
analysis  of  interest  rate-sensitive  assets  and  liabilities  shows  a  potential  loss  of  13.69 
percent  of  own  funds,  assuming  a  standardised/uniform  shock  of  200  basis  points  on  the 
term structure of interest rates (the analysis takes into account a parallel upward shift in the 
yield curve). The impact would result, ceteris paribus, in a potential decline in total capital 
ratio at system level by up to 2.6 percentage points (Figure 10). 
 2 
Liquidity  ratios  for  the  banking  sector  continue  to  post,  on  average,  significantly  higher 
levels  than  the  minimum  requirement.  The  average  liquidity  coverage  ratio  (LCR)  at 
aggregate  level  is  239  percent  (September  2017),  standing  above  the  EU-wide  average  of 
145.6  percent  (June  2017).  The  LCR  ratio  (Figure  11)  confirms  that  the  Romanian  banking 
sector holds a stock of quality liquid assets adequate to withstand a stress scenario for a 30-
day period. However, the immediate liquidity ratio calculated as the ratio of cash and bank 
deposits at net value and unpledged government securities to total liabilities – the minimum 
prudent level being 30 percent – fell marginally to 38 percent. 
Asset quality indicators improved (the non-performing loan ratio dropped below 8 percent, 
thereby  entering  the  EBA-defined  intermediate  bucket),  Romania  posting  the  fastest 
adjustment pace of NPL ratio in the past three years (Figure 13). The NPL decline occurred 
for  all  categories  of  debtors  and  the  NPL  coverage  by  provisions  has  remained  adequate 
(Figure  14).  Looking  at  the  asset  structure,  loans  to  the  real  sector  have  risen  slightly. 
Turning  to  the  liability  structure,  the  banking  sector  has  further  seen  an  uptrend  in 
household  deposits,  counterbalancing  the  drop  in  foreign  liabilities,  which  is  likely  to 
mitigate the contagion risk to external shocks (Figure 15). 
Banking sector profitability has strengthened against the background of a favourable local 
macroeconomic environment, the significant reduction in net impairment loss on financial 
assets,  the  protracted  low  level  of  funding  costs,  and  of  the  recovery  in  leu-denominated 
lending. Operational efficiency is in a better position compared to the EU-wide average, but 
there  is  still  room  for  improvement,  especially  for  small-  and  medium-sized  banks  (Figure 
16). The banking sector has continued to consolidate. 
The entry into force of the new international financial reporting standards (IFRS 9) in 2018 
implies  both  implementation  costs  and  increases  in  impairment  loss.  For  the  credit 
institutions in Romania, the impact would be low: (i) total capital ratio would decline by 24 
basis  points  and  the  Tier  1  capital  ratio  would  fall  by  25  basis  points;  (ii)  expected  losses 
would  rise  marginally  against  the  current  level  of  impairment  loss  (0.5  percent).  The 
portfolios for which the expected loss will be higher than current impairment loss are those 
of  loans  granted  to  the  retail  segment  and  regional  governments.  Heterogeneity  is  higher 
for  banks  at  individual  level,  but  is  not  likely  to  affect  their  stability  considering  the 
substantial surplus in solvency indicators (Figure 17). 
Starting with this issue of the Report, the NBR Board has decided to contain the number of 
presented risks to five at most, for two reasons: the opportunity to focus the analysis and 
draw  attention  to  the  most 
important  messages,  and  the  harmonisation  with 
international good practice of central banks that publish financial stability reports, the ECB 
in  particular.  A  full  comparison  with  the  risk  map  in  the  previous  reports  is  therefore 
unfeasible.   
 3 
No severe systemic risk has been identified, but a combination of the identified risks may 
induce a severe risk, amid unfavourable market conditions. 
The main risks to financial stability are set out in the table below. 
 The  risk  of  fast  deterioration in investor  sentiment  in  emerging  economies  is  high,  given 
that the uncertainties about the strengthening of global economic growth and international 
trade  are  still  significant,  amid  the  risks  arising  from  economic  and  monetary  policies,  the 
build-up  of  structural  imbalances  in  the  emerging  economies  and  heightening  geopolitical 
tensions. An abrupt adjustment of the risk premium attached to emerging economies may 
trigger sizeable negative consequences on the domestic environment. 
This is, in fact, the credit risk, or the risk of an increase in interest rate, stemming from the 
monetary policies of the advanced economies, the external uncertainties and the way the 
market  reacts  to  these.  Against  this  background,  credit  risk  refers  to  an  increase  in  the 
cost  of  foreign  funding  for  both  the  Romanian  government  (Figures  19  and  20)  and  the 
banking and corporate sectors. 
It  is  noted that,  in  recent  months,  this  risk  has  already  started  materialising.  The  Federal 
Reserve  initiated  the  monetary  policy  tightening  cycle.  The  Bank  of  England  decided  to 
increase the bank rate, which, in spite of keeping the real rate strongly negative, may act as 
a signal – especially amid growing uncertainties about Brexit. In one of the peer economies 
in  the  region,  the  Czech  National  Bank  raised  the  policy  rate  twice  –  under  special 
circumstances,  after  exiting  from  the  exchange  rate  commitment,  and  in  the  context  of  a 
rising inflation. The European Central Bank decided to taper the asset purchase programme, 
even though no date has been set as yet for ending this programme. Although at different 
speeds  and  with  notable  exceptions  (the  Bank  of  Japan,  for  instance),  it  becomes 
increasingly clear that the low interest rate era is drawing to a close.  Emerging economies 
are usually affected when interest rates go up in advanced economies and it is essential 
that such episodes find them in good order domestically. 
 4 
This is why the ongoing tensions surrounding macroeconomic equilibria in Romania since 
the  previous  Report  are  a  reason  for  concern.  The  chief  driver  of  economic  growth  was 
domestic consumption (Figure 21), while the external balance made a negative contribution 
because of the widening deficit on trade in goods (Figure 22). Investment did not contribute 
significantly to economic growth. Economic growth above potential is not always a cause for 
concern, particularly when it takes place after a recession, for instance. Moreover, there are 
a number of arguments that show that the economy’s growth potential can be  larger than 
that calculated at present for both technical reasons (the time series are not long enough 
and  were  influenced  by  the  2009-2010  recession)  and  fundamental  reasons,  which, 
however,  can  be  turned  to  good  account  only  by  structural  adjustments.  Thus,  full 
employment  is  a  textbook  requirement  for  fulfilling  the  economic  growth  potential: 
important  resources  come,  in  this  respect,  from  the  almost  3  million  Romanians  working 
abroad and circa 4 million inactive Romanians. Nor is the growth structure per se a systemic 
risk,  especially  if  part  of  the  pick-up  in  domestic  demand  is  accommodated  by  the  rise  in 
domestic supply. Nevertheless, the developments in the twin deficits (the fiscal deficit and 
the  current  account  deficit)  are  a  cause  for  concern,  as  they  signal  exactly  the  above-
potential  growth  of  economic  activity  at  present,  which  may  jeopardise  medium-term 
financial stability. The expansionary fiscal policy pursued starting with 2016, by applying 
the 2015 Tax Code, has carried on in 2017, causing the fiscal space gained in 2010-2015 to 
be  exhausted  (Figure  23).  The  current  account  deficit-to-GDP  ratio,  though  well  below  its 
pre-crisis  levels,  has  posted  divergent  developments from  those  in the other  EU  emerging 
economies (Figure 24). The structural deficit significantly exceeded the 1 percent medium-
term  objective  in  2016  and  is  estimated  to  stand  at  3.9  percent  in  2017  (Figure  25).  As  a 
matter  of  fact,  the  European  Commission  has  included  Romania  into  the  Significant 
Deviation Procedure from the medium-term objective. 
When  actual  GDP  growth  exceeds  potential  growth,  it  is recommended  to  make  savings 
for fiscal consolidation reasons. Additional income from above-potential economic growth 
allows for the financing of extra spending in the short run only. Yet, this expenditure is of a 
permanent nature, while income is temporary, as it will decline,  ceteris paribus, when the 
economy  returns  to  normal  (potential)  growth  rates.  Therefore,  above-potential  growth 
conceals  a  structural  deficit  larger  than  the  cash  deficit.  Today’s  structural  deficit  is, 
however, the cash deficit of tomorrow which will need to be financed under circumstances 
that may turn unfavourable for emerging economies.  
This mix between an expansionary budgetary and fiscal policy during a  period of above-
potential economic growth and the worsening global market sentiment towards emerging 
economies  in  general  can  enhance  volatility  and  affect  financial  stability  via  several 
channels: the interest rate, the exchange rate, the inflation rate.  
The  advance  in  household  indebtedness  can  cause  these  risks  to  pass  through  from  the 
macroeconomic  level  to  the  microeconomic  level  for  debtors.  Last  years’  environment 
 5 
marked  by  low  interest  rates  and  sustained  increase  in  new  loans  favours  the  build-up  of 
possible  vulnerabilities  concerning  the  sustainability  of  the  level  of  indebtedness  through 
both  banks  and  NBFIs  (Figure  26),  especially  for  lower-income  debtors.  The  fact  that  the 
great majority of the stock and flow of housing loans and corporate loans are variable-rate 
loans (Figure 27) is an aggravating factor for financial stability in the context of the start of 
a new interest rate hike cycle – for external reasons, domestic reasons or for a combination 
of reasons.  
The  fact  that  the  advance  in  household  indebtedness  occurs  concurrently  with  the  high 
economic growth rates indicates the problems of economic growth: it is unbalanced and it 
leads to deeper inequality between social groups. Debt service-to-income ratio for debtors 
earning  minimum  to  average  wage  economy-wide  stands  higher  than  that  for  debtors 
earning double the average wage, notably among borrowers with housing loans (Figure 28). 
At the same time, the debt service for new loans taken by households earning minimum to 
average  wage  economy-wide  went  up  by  2  percentage  points  over  the  last  12  months. 
Considering that almost 30 percent of the borrowers with housing loans earn minimum to 
average  wage  economy-wide,  a  significant  share  of  households  report  worrying 
indebtedness levels in the event of unfavourable developments.   
Moreover,  the  access  to  financing  is  much  more  reduced  for  individuals  in  the  lower 
quintiles:  only  1  percent  of  the  individuals  in  the  first  three  quintiles  took  a  housing  loan 
(Figure  29).  The  low  interest  rates  and  the  granting  of  loans  in  lei  improved  access  to 
financing, but the upward trend in property prices offset these developments.  
Housing  loans  show  a  higher  sensitivity  to  consumer  loans,  to  possible  shocks  on  the 
interest rate, the income or the exchange rate, given their maturity and the higher amounts 
taken. In the context of the historically low interest rates seen at present, the main medium-
term risk comes from the impact of future rises in the financing cost on the indebtedness 
level. The DSTI ratio for housing loans would witness the largest increase in the event of a 2 
percentage point interest rate hike (by 5.3 percentage points, Figure 30). By breakdown, the 
interest  rate  shock  would  generate  an  approximately  10  percentage  point  advance  in  the 
share of debtors with a DSTI ratio above 40 percent. Moreover, in June 2016-June 2017, the 
median  value  of  a  new  housing  loan  continued  to  rise,  standing  5  percent  above  that  of 
outstanding  housing  exposures.  This  causes  indebtedness  to  become  more  sensitive  to 
interest rate changes, amplifying debtors’ vulnerability. 
It  is  deemed  that  both  the  tensions  surrounding  macroeconomic  equilibria  and  the 
increase in household indebtedness are growing risks to the country’s financial stability, 
especially  in  the  context  of  the  changing  global  market  sentiment  towards  emerging 
economies,  as 
risk  premium.  These  developments  can  be 
counterbalanced  by  a  stable  and  predictable  domestic  environment,  but  can  also  be 
heightened  by  a  state  of  uncertainty  caused  by  major,  insufficiently  prepared  and 
explained changes in the public policy mix. Uncertainty delays investment and increases 
reflected  by 
the 
 6 
the preference for liquidity – and the price for the preference for liquidity is the interest 
rate. When the external environment is uncertainty-ridden and is facing a cycle reversal, it 
is  advisable  that  the  domestic  environment  should  not  add  to  these  uncertainties.  The 
pursuit  of  fulfilling  economic  policy  priorities  should  not  jeopardise  financial  stability, 
which is a public good. 
Another  identified  systemic  risk  is  the  weak  payment  discipline  economy-wide,  which 
reflects  in  soft  budget  constraints  in  the  private  sector  as  well.  This  contributes  to  the 
deepening of vulnerabilities that may affect financial stability through inefficient resource 
allocation,  the  rise  in  non-performing  loans,  the  distortion  of  market  signals  and  the 
creation of quasi-broad money with negative effects on inflation. The main risk factors to 
financial  stability  are:  (i)  the  undercapitalisation  of  a  large  number  of  companies  (276.4 
thousand firms with net worth below the required threshold, out of which 268.5 thousand 
firms with negative equity), induced particularly by losses (217.3 thousand firms with total 
losses of lei 33 billion in 2016), as well as the high indebtedness level in certain sectors, (ii) 
the increase in past due obligations to the government budget (up 5.9 percent in 2016), (iii) 
the low capacity to recover commercial claims, especially at the level of micro-enterprises, 
(iv) corroborated by the large number of firms in credit institutions’ portfolio which have not 
gone through a full business cycle, (v) the return of insolvency to an upward trend in terms 
of both the number of newly-insolvent firms (6.1 thousand firms in the first eight months of 
the  year)  and  the  volume  of  non-performing  loans  generated  in  the  banking  sector  (the 
volume  of  non-performing  loans  generated  by  the  companies  undergoing  insolvency 
proceedings  increased  by  about  one  third  to  lei  1  billion)  and  (vi)  the  rise  in  overdue 
payments  of  the  government  budget  to  the  real  sector  (up  9  percent  in  the  period  from 
September 2016 to September 2017 to lei 223.1 million). In a broader perspective, the weak 
payment  discipline  economy-wide  has  highlighted  structural  vulnerabilities  in  the  balance 
sheets of companies (Figures 31-34). 
It is worth noting that the poor payment discipline economy-wide is not a new risk, but a 
recurrent vulnerability in Romania’s economy. It was deemed necessary to be emphasised 
as  a  distinct  risk  that  is  on  the  rise  on  account  of  three  reasons  which  make  it  more 
dangerous today than previously: (i) the reduction in the vulnerabilities in banks’ balance 
sheets (through the clean-up of the non-performing loan portfolio) does not translate into a 
corresponding  decrease  in  the  vulnerabilities  in  firms’  balance  sheets,  which  reveals  the 
persistence  of  structural  issues  economy-wide;  (ii)  the  vulnerabilities  in  firms’  balance 
sheets have persisted even in an environment of above-potential economic growth; and 
(iii) after the conclusion of the arrangement with the International Monetary Fund and the 
European  Union,  part  of  the  reforms  carried  out  during  the  period  covered  by  the 
agreement  with  regard  to  strengthening  payment  discipline  in  the  economy  (cutting 
arrears, in particular) were reversed. 
 7 
In  fact,  the  reversal  of  structural  reforms  seems  to  have  started  shortly  after  the 
completion of the arrangement with the IMF and the EU, being manifest in the case of at 
least two of the highlighted risks: the tensions surrounding macroeconomic equilibria (as 
a  result  of  giving  up  fiscal  consolidation)  and  the  weakening  payment  discipline  in  the 
economy. 
A risk of lower magnitude, yet related to the increase in household indebtedness,  refers to 
property prices.  The  faster  increase  in  property  prices  further  poses  a  risk  to  the  banking 
sector,  as  credit  institutions’  exposures  to  the  real  estate  market  are  substantial.  House 
prices  posted  positive  dynamics,  albeit  significantly  slower  than  those  seen  in  many  EU 
countries  (Figures  35  and  36),  on  the  back  of  higher  household  income,  individuals’ 
improved  expectations  on  their  financial  standing  and  of  further  extremely  low  interest 
rates  (Figure  37).  Nevertheless,  only  a  small  part  of  real  estate  transactions  are  loan-
financed.  In  the  medium  run,  the  potential  risks  that  may  arise  from  mortgage-backed 
loans refer to the high interest rate sensitivity in the case of debtors having taken housing 
loans (Figure 38). 
The  five  risks  summarised  above  are  cyclical,  being  related  to  the  developments  in  the 
business  and  financial  cycles.  They  can  be  amplified,  in  the  future,  by  a  potential 
deceleration  of  GDP  dynamics,  which  will  also raise  the issue of the  next  growth  engine 
(after  the  engine  of  domestic  consumption  slows  down).  The  increase  in  financial 
intermediation  for  the  corporate  sector  could  be  this  alternative  driver,  but  only  in  the 
context of improving payment discipline, lower uncertainties and a reversal to a positive 
market sentiment. 
These five cyclical risks are compounded by a fundamental, structural problem specific not 
only  to  the  economy,  but  also  to  the  Romanian  society,  i.e.  the  demographic  problem. 
This is generated, on the one hand, by the natural decline in population, and, on the other 
hand, by emigration. Although the GDP hit a 25-year high, Romania continues to see further 
emigration  and  ageing  population.  The  negative  natural  population  growth  has  become 
significantly  more  pronounced  over  the  last  years,  Romania  reporting  one  of  the  highest 
values  in the  EU,  while  emigration  is  endemic. Furthermore,  emigration  also  affects high-
skilled  professions,  such  as  those  in  the  healthcare  sector.  Thus,  pressures  emerge  that 
contribute  to  increasing  tensions  on  macroeconomic  equilibria  and  contain  potential  GDP 
growth. 
In  order  to  mitigate  risks  to  financial  stability,  the  Report  highlights  a  number  of  possible 
measures to (i) reduce the risk of public debt refinancing, also with the help of measures to 
further  extend  the  maturity  of  debt  instruments,  (ii)  align  the  structural  deficit  with  the 
medium-term objective, (iii) enhance debtors’ capacity to withstand adverse developments, 
(iv) ensure the better targeting of the “First Home“ programme from a social perspective, 
(v) recapitalise the companies with net worth below the required threshold and review the 
market  entry  and  exit  conditions  for  firms,  (vi)  improve  employment,  lower  the  labour 
 8 
underutilisation  rate,  also  in  what  concerns  regional  disparities,  and  (vii)  increase  the 
legislative framework predictability. 
to  mitigate  the  risk  of  household  overindebtedness 
The National Bank of Romania monitors closely the evolution of risks to financial stability 
and  seeks 
through  the 
macroprudential  policies  it  has  adopted  or  prepares  to  adopt.  Moreover,  the  NBR 
considers that debtors would be better protected in the medium run if they requested, to 
a  larger  extent,  to  enter  fixed  interest  rate  credit  agreements.  Additionally,  within  the 
National Committee for Macroprudential Oversight, the NBR has underlined the financial 
stability risks deriving from soft budget constraints in the economy. In order to strengthen 
the  economy’s  resilience  to  external  shocks,  particularly  those  related  to  credit  risk,  it  is 
necessary to have in place a prudent and balanced mix of economic policies that should 
pursue  the  return  to  the  medium-term  objective  (structural  deficit  narrowing)  and  the 
improvement of payment discipline economy-wide.
