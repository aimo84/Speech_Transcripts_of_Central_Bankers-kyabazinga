 Svein Gjedrem: Inflation targeting 
Address by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the seminar on 
foreign  exchange  policy 
the  Association  of  Economists,  Gausdal, 
31 January 2003. 
The address is based on the assessments presented at Norges Bank’s press conference following the Executive 
Board’s monetary policy meeting on 22 January and on previous speeches. Please note that the text below may 
differ slightly from the actual presentation.

The  Norwegian  economy  exhibited  strong  growth  from  1993  until  1998.  This  recovery  brought  the 
economy out of recession into a period of high economic activity.

 Growth in the mainland economy in the 1990s averaged over 3 per cent. Inflation was low and stable 
at around 2½ per cent annually, while it was higher than 8 per cent in the 1980s.

 At the same time, total employment rose sharply. The unemployment rate, measured by the LFS, fell 
from close to 6 per cent in 1991 to almost 3 per cent in 1999. 
Later in the 1990s, unemployment declined as long as wage growth in Norway was lower than wage 
growth among our trading partners. This came to a halt in 1998. The rise in salaries for white-collar 
workers  accelerated  and  the  social  partners  rejected  a  policy  of  wage  moderation.  Unemployment 
stopped falling.

 At  the  beginning  of  the  1990s,  the  economy  was  in  a  deep  recession.  Production  was  well  below 
capacity.  When  growth  in  the  economy  picked  up,  capacity  utilisation  increased.  The  output  gap1, 
according to our methods of calculation, was closed around 1996. Thereafter, cost inflation and the 
rise  in  prices  for  goods  and  services  produced  for  the  domestic  market  accelerated.  The  upturn 
reached its peak in 1997, with GDP growth approaching 5 per cent.  
The pace of such a strong upturn could not be sustained. In 1997 and 1998 the economy shifted from 
an  upturn  with  high  growth  rates  to  an  expansion  with  lower  growth  but  low  unemployment,  labour 
shortages in many sectors and strong growth in labour costs.

 Many other countries also experienced a period of strong expansion in the 1990s. Economic growth in 
the  US  was  particularly  high.  New  technology  generated  optimism  and  laid  the  basis  for  strong 
investment growth. At the same time, wage growth and inflation remained low. Equity prices, however, 
rose  sharply  just  before  the  turn  of  the  millennium,  particularly  in  the  US,  but  also  in  many  other 
countries. 
                                                      
1   The output gap, which is a reflection of capacity utilisation in the economy, is measured by different methods: the trend GDP 
method  (the  HP method)  and  the  potential  GDP method  (the  production  function method). When  using  the  HP method, 
adjustments are made for the increase in vacation days in 2001 and 2002. This is also taken into account when applying the 
production  function  method.  The  output  gap  is  zero  if  aggregate  output  is  equivalent  to  the  level  of  activity  that  can  be 
achieved over time without generating a rise in price and cost inflation. A positive output gap indicates a level of activity that 
fuels pressures on economic resources and rising price and cost inflation. (See for example Frøyland and Nymoen (2000) 
and Olsen, Qvigstad and Røisland (2003) for more on the output gap.) 
  The optimism spread to Norway, where equity prices also rose. The level of activity was very high in 
the securities market, among corporate lawyers, consultancies and in the ICT industry.  
High  oil  prices  through  most  of  the  1990s  resulted  in  buoyant  investment  activity  and  growth  in 
operating expenses in the petroleum sector. With substantial government tax revenues, expectations 
concerning  the  use  of  petroleum  revenues  also  rose.  It  became  increasingly  challenging  to  keep 
pressures in the economy at bay by means of fiscal policy. 
The response to this challenge was the revision of economic policy in spring 2001. The most important 
policy change was the strategy for the phasing in of petroleum revenues – the so-called fiscal rule. An 
inflation  target  for  monetary  policy  was  introduced  at  the  same  time.  The  revision  came  after  four 
years of strong economic expansion and high growth in labour costs, pressures to spend petroleum 
revenues and high household credit growth. 
Implementation of monetary policy
• The interest rate is set so as to keep inflation at a low and stable level
• Higher interest rates will reduce inflation by curbing demand and strengthening 
the krone. An interest rate reduction has the opposite effect.
• The effects of interest rates on inflation may vary over time.
• The effects on the exchange rate may vary according to international conditions
- interest rates in other countries
- required rates of return and risk premiums in financial markets
SG Gausdal 31.01.03
 Norges  Bank  has  one  instrument:  the  interest  rate.  It  is  set  to  achieve  the  operational  target  for 
monetary  policy  -  an  inflation  rate  of  2½  per  cent  over  time.  An  increase  in  the  interest  rate  will 
normally  contribute  to  reducing  inflation  by  curbing  demand  for  goods  and  services  and  by 
strengthening the krone against other currencies. An interest rate reduction has the opposite effect.  
Inflation targeting means that monetary policy contributes to smoothing fluctuations in the economy. 
This implies that the interest rate is increased in response to pressures in the economy and a risk of 
higher inflation, and that the interest rate is reduced when growth is sluggish and the outlook points to 
lower inflation. This objective is also expressed in the Regulation on Monetary Policy.  
The  effect  of  the  interest  rate  on  inflation  is  uncertain  and  may  vary  over  time.  Its  impact  is  partly 
dependent on the debt rate in the private and public sectors, the situation in the labour market and the 
impact of a change in the interest rate on the exchange rate. The effect of interest rate changes on the 
exchange rate may vary according to external conditions, such as foreign interest rates, required rates 
of return and risk premiums in international financial markets. 
If interest rate changes are to have the intended effect, confidence in monetary policy among financial 
market participants is an important precondition. Without such confidence, it is not possible to predict 
the impact of monetary policy on the real economy or on inflation.  
The  difference  between  expected  short-term  rates  in  Norway  and  Germany  10  years  ahead  is  a 
measure  of  confidence  in  monetary  policy.  In  the  period  following  the  introduction  of  the  inflation 
target, long-term forward rates have largely been around 1 percentage point higher than in Germany. 
Between  ½  and  1  percentage  point  can  probably  be  ascribed  to  Norway’s  inflation  target,  which  is 
higher than the price stability objective for the euro area. The narrow differential between Norwegian 
and German forward rates indicates that there is confidence that the inflation target will be achieved. If 
this confidence did not exist, the forward rate differential would probably have been far wider.

 The  forward  rate  differential  against  Germany  has  narrowed  somewhat  recently  to  around 
½ percentage point. German forward rates have risen, while Norwegian forward rates have been more 
stable. The forward rate differential between the US and Germany is now close to zero. This may be 
related to greater uncertainty as to developments in the German economy.

 The mandate for monetary policy with an inflation target provides a sound basis for assessing Norges 
Bank's interest rate setting. 
According to the regulation, the direct effects on consumer prices resulting from changes in interest 
rates, taxes, excise duties and extraordinary temporary disturbances shall in general not be taken into 
account.  This  means  that  monetary  policy  must  be  oriented  towards  bringing  underlying  inflation, 
adjusted for the deviations mentioned above, close to 2½ per cent. An adjusted index such as this will 
be most relevant when assessing the orientation of monetary policy in retrospect.  
The  most  common  indicator  of  underlying  inflation  –  the  consumer  price  index  adjusted  for  tax 
changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) – has shown a year-on-year increase of between 
1.8  per  cent  and  2.7  per  cent  since  the  inflation  target  was  introduced.  In  December,  the  last 
observation to date, the year-on-year rise was 1.8 per cent.  
When we report on the implementation of monetary policy, as in our Annual Report sent to the Ministry 
of  Finance  for  submission  to  the  King  and  communication  to  the  Storting,  we  will  place  particular 
emphasis on analysing the reasons for deviations from the target that exceed +/- 1 percentage point.

 When the inflation target was introduced, the economy was marked by pressures in the labour market, 
high cost inflation, considerable optimism among households and enterprises and high expectations of 
increased use of petroleum revenues in the public sector. Norway introduced an inflation target almost 
two  years  ago.  Today’s  inflation  is  therefore  to  a  considerable  extent  influenced  by  the  policy  we 
pursued  following  the  revision  of  economic  policy  on  29  March  2001.  Developments  have  provided 
further evidence that monetary policy is an effective instrument against inflation. Inflation is low even 
though wage growth is unusually high. Monetary policy is working.

 The underlying rise in prices has slowed in recent months, down to 2.0 per cent in the fourth quarter of 
2002. The projection for the underlying rise in prices in that quarter was revised down in autumn 2001, 
from  2.5  per  cent  to  2.1  per  cent.  Since  then,  our  projections  have  varied  between  2.0  and 
2.2 per cent. The inflation projections for the fourth quarter of 2002 have been relatively stable since 
the end of 2000 and close to the actual level of inflation. The low level of inflation is closely related to 
specific economic developments that have taken place over the past two years. 
Three important disturbances have influenced the 22 months of inflation targeting that lie behind us: 
strong wage growth, the global downturn and a considerable appreciation of the krone. 
The wage settlement in 2002 resulted in the highest increase in real wages in a generation.  
After the  wage settlement last  year,  we projected annual  wage growth  in 2002 of between 5½  and 
6 per cent. Wage growth in 2002 was far higher than expected. Substantial pay increases were also 
agreed  on  for  2003.  The  various  groups  achieved  very  different  results,  increasing  the  risk  of 
wage-wage spirals. The outcome of last year’s wage settlement may be an indication that the social 
partners considered the labour market to be very tight this spring.

 There  is  little  new  information  about  wage  developments  since  the  wage  settlement  last  year. 
Agreements have been concluded awarding high pay increases to seamen and doctors. We may have 
underestimated  the  growth  in  salaries  for  white-collar  workers  last  year,  but  there  is  also  some 
anecdotal evidence to suggest that during the autumn large companies and law and consultancy firms 
tightened cost control.

 Since 1998, wage growth in Norway has been markedly higher than that of our trading partners. Until 
spring 2001, the monetary policy objective implied that, over time, wage growth had to be reduced to 
the level in Europe. The inflation target of 2½ per cent implies that wage growth over time can hover 
around  4½  per  cent.  This  takes  into  account  that  productivity  growth  in  Norway  has  been  around 
2 per cent  over  the  past  twenty  years.  If  wage  growth  is  higher  than  4½  per  cent,  monetary  policy 
generally  has  to  be  tight  in  order  to  counter  inflation.  This  will  normally  lead  to  deteriorating 
competitiveness  in  the  business  sector.  If  wage  growth  is  lower  than  4½  per  cent,  monetary  policy 
normally has to be eased to counter inflation that is too low. This can result in a weaker krone and an 
improvement in competitiveness in the business sector. 
The difference between current wage growth and the long-term equilibrium level of 4½ per cent can be 
referred to as the wage gap for the Norwegian economy.2 This wage gap also provides an indication of 
pressures in the real economy, not unlike the measures of the output gap shown earlier. As illustrated, 
                                                      
2   The wage gap is calculated as the difference between the rise in labour costs in manufacturing in Norway and 4.5 per cent. 
The wage gap is calculated as the difference between the rise in labour costs in Norway and trading partners in the years 
prior to 2001. 
  there tends to be a correlation between the wage gap and the output gap. The output gap can be an 
expression  of  our  assessment  of  pressures  in  the  economy.  The  wage  gap  can  be  a  more  direct 
indication of the social partners’ perception of the situation. This provides useful information in interest 
rate setting. Moreover, wage figures and wage growth estimates in real time are considerably more 
reliable than preliminary national accounts figures for output and demand that are used to estimate the 
output gap, which tend to be subject to substantial revision. The wage growth estimates drawn up by 
Norges  Bank  early  last  summer,  just  after  the  income  settlements,  underestimated  the  increase  by 
0.16 percentage point, with small deviations, on average for the period 1995-2001. On the other hand, 
the  wage  gap  is  a  lagging  indicator. Wage  growth  in  any  one  year  has  been  heavily  influenced  by 
economic developments in the preceding 12-18 months. When we look at future prospects, a good 
estimate for the output gap can therefore provide a better indication of the outlook for wage and price 
inflation.  Both  these  simple  measures  are  based  on  stylised  assumptions  concerning  productivity 
growth and must therefore be used with caution.

 The high level  of wage growth in 2002 implied a tight monetary policy. The interest rate differential 
against trading partners widened. The krone appreciated further.  
Relationships  in  the  foreign  exchange  market  are  unstable,  but  there  are  a  number  of fundamental 
forces that influence the krone. 
High oil prices and the phasing in of petroleum revenues into the Norwegian economy are part of the 
explanation,  but  the  predominant  factor  is  probably  the  cyclical  divergence  between  Norway  and 
abroad.

 The main explanation for the wide interest rate differential is not that interest rates are high in Norway, 
but that interest rates are at a historic low abroad. For example, interest rates have not been at such a 
  low level in the US since the 1960s. Foreign interest rates have been reduced markedly to counter a 
downturn, while Norway has featured labour shortages, high income and consumption growth and a 
more normal interest rate. Low volatility in foreign exchange markets has probably amplified the effect 
of a wide interest rate differential. Furthermore, equity prices have shown a pronounced decline over 
close to 2½ years and investors have been seeking alternative investment vehicles.  
The appreciation of the krone in the first half of last year gradually changed the inflation outlook. In 
isolation,  this  implied  a  reduction  in  interest  rates.  However,  the  Norwegian  economy  was  also 
exposed to high pay increases last spring, which had the opposite effect.  
In this situation, if monetary policy were to give priority to short-term inflation considerations, we could 
perhaps have reduced the interest rate last summer. But this would have led to fluctuations in output 
and  employment.  Household  and  enterprises  might  have  continued  to  increase  their  borrowing.  In 
addition, we might have been confronted with waning confidence in financial markets and a weaker 
krone. Once the effects of high wage growth had fed through to prices and pushed up inflation, the 
interest rate would have been raised irrespectively, perhaps to a higher level than has been the case. 
The end result of such a policy would have been wider fluctuations in aggregate demand, output and 
employment.  
As the inflation target gains confidence and credibility also among the social partners, the interest rate 
will  make  an  even  greater  contribution  to  stability  in  the  real  economy.  Overall  employment  is 
influenced by wage formation. Monetary policy cannot prevent an increase in unemployment that is 
caused by a wage-driven cost shock.

 In spite of last year’s high wage growth, the interest rate was only raised by 0.5 percentage point last 
summer.  Later  in  the  year,  the  interest  rate  was  reduced,  primarily  as  a  result  of  weak  external 
economic developments that led to a reduction in interest rates abroad, thereby widening the interest 
rate  differential.  The  global  downturn  and  the  strengthening  of  the  krone  have  had  a  dampening 
impact  on  the  Norwegian  economy.  When  cyclical  developments  in  Norway  and  abroad  again 
converge, interest rates in Norway will be closer to the level abroad. This may also bring the krone 
back to a more normal level. Today’s particularly strong krone must also be seen in connection with 
the stock market decline, high oil prices and fears of war in Iraq. The very low level of interest rates 
among trading partners reflects an environment of sluggish growth, high unemployment and a risk of a 
prolonged downturn with deflation. This is a situation that we must strive to avoid. 
The direct effect of the global downturn on overall growth in the Norwegian economy has so far been 
limited.  This  is  partly  attributable  to  high  oil  prices  and  the  high  level  of  activity  in  the  oil  sector. 
However, as a result of the interest rate differential and the strong krone, the global downturn will have 
a substantial impact on Norwegian business and industry. 
The  government’s  use  of  petroleum  revenues  or  expectations  of  increased  spending  of  petroleum 
revenues may have contributed to sustaining activity and the strong krone. Increased use of petroleum 
revenues over the central government budget is stimulating demand for goods and services. This will 
intensify the contest for economic resources and pressures in the business sector.

 The exchange rate may move more in the short term than is necessary in the long term. One reason 
may  be  that  the  krone  has  to  overshoot  its  long-term  level  since  market  participants  will  weigh  the 
interest rate differential against the possibility of a future depreciation of the krone. However, we may 
also have seen an extra wave in the exchange rate if market participants are basing their expectations 
on  higher  government  spending  of  petroleum  revenues  than  implied  by  the  fiscal  rule.  Given  the 
current level of the exchange rate, it would appear that foreign exchange market operators have been 
expecting  a  substantial  increase  in  the  use  of  petroleum  revenues.  Fiscal  policy  discipline  will 
therefore be of importance to the krone exchange rate.  
Fiscal policy
• The fiscal policy guideline: the central government 
budget deficit shall be equivalent over time to the 
expected real return on the Government Petroleum Fund.
• The fiscal guideline has been adhered to
• The fiscal guideline implies that petroleum revenues shall 
be phased in gradually
• The fiscal guideline is robust to fluctuations in 
government revenues
SG Gausdal 31.01.03
 According to the guideline for fiscal policy, the central government budget deficit shall over time be 
equivalent to the expected real return on the Petroleum Fund. The fiscal rule is robust to fluctuations in 
government revenues and provides a stable framework for economic developments. 
The fiscal rule has been adhered to. In the budget for 2003, petroleum revenue spending was indeed 
somewhat higher than 4 per cent of the Petroleum Fund. This was because the estimated value of the 
Petroleum Fund at the end of 2002 was markedly reduced through the year as a result of the sharp 
decline in equity prices and the appreciation of the krone. Spreading the use of revenues in this way is 
in line with the fiscal rule as it has been formulated. 
As a result of the change  in the  inflation  outlook two  years ahead, Norges  Bank’s Executive  Board 
decided  to  reduce  the  key  rate  by  0.5  percentage  point,  to  6.0  per  cent,  on  22  January.  In  its 
assessment of the inflation outlook, Norges Bank pointed out that the krone has strengthened since 
the October Inflation Report and that it was 3 per cent stronger than the assumption underlying the 
baseline  scenario.  We  also  cited  fears  of  war  and  high  oil  prices,  a  weak  and  unsteady  global 
recovery, higher electricity prices, lower optimism among households and the prospect of lower growth 
  in private consumption than previously projected. We also pointed out that we had not yet seen the full 
impact of high wage growth and a strong krone on employment in enterprises that are heavily exposed 
to international competition. 
On  balance,  developments  point  to  low  inflation  in  the  period  ahead.  According  to  Norges  Bank’s 
assessment, with an interest rate of 6.0 per cent, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be 
lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. 
The  global  recovery  is  weak  and  unsteady.  Growth  forecasts  for  our  trading  partners  were  revised 
downwards in the course of last year. The situation has been marked by fears of war in Iraq over a 
longer period.

 In the US, consumer confidence has weakened since the autumn of 2000. Growth in the US has been 
sustained over the last  year, fuelled by low interest rates, an expansionary government budget and 
growth  in  private  consumption.  Business  investment  and  net  exports  have  made  a  negative 
contribution.  A  new  package  of  measures,  including  tax  cuts  and  higher  government  transfers,  has 
recently  been  presented  in  order  to  stimulate  the  US  economy  and  prevent  a  recession.  However, 
growth in the US will probably remain low this year.

 Monetary policy in Europe has become more expansionary. Since the presentation of Norges Bank’s 
Inflation Report on 30 October, key rates have been reduced by 0.5 percentage point in Sweden and 
the  euro  area.  The  outlook  for  the  euro  area  is  still  not  very  encouraging.  In  particular,  industrial 
confidence has been weak for some time.

 There are also signs of stagnation and low growth in the Norwegian economy. The chart shows the 
contribution from net exports to activity in the mainland economy. We see that this component curbed 
growth  in  mainland  Norway  by  about  ¾  percentage  point,  from  a  positive  contribution  of  a  good 
1 percentage  point  in  1999.  In  contrast  to  the  situation  in  the  mid-1990s,  when  high  imports 
contributed to weak net exports, our export industries are now being affected. Traditional merchandise 
exports  fell  towards  the  end  of  last  year.  Export  prices  have  also  declined  somewhat,  reducing 
corporate  profitability.  A  strong  krone  and  high  domestic  demand  have  also  contributed  to  the 
continued rise in imports. 
Regional network November 2002
• Generally falling production in the export industry.
• Slow growth in industrial output for the domestic market
• For retail trade and services there is growth in supplies to 
households and no growth in supplies to the business sector
• Lower unemployment in manufacturing and higher demand for 
labour in retail trade
SG Gausdal 31.01.03
 Last  autumn,  our  regional  network  reported  lower  activity  in  some  manufacturing  sectors  and  low 
growth  in  manufacturing  production  for  the  home  market.  In  addition,  there  is  no  growth  in  sectors 
supplying services to the business sector. On the other hand, the level of activity in retail trade and 
services for households is higher. Companies are reporting lower employment in manufacturing, but 
higher demand for labour in retail trade. 
Unemployment has edged up over the last six months. There was little increase in manufacturing up to 
end-2002. Unemployment has primarily risen in services, communication and the IT sector. However, 
an increase in manufacturing unemployment was observed in January. Manufacturing unemployment 
is expected to edge up in the period ahead. Moreover, the high pay increases awarded in last year’s 
settlements have consumed a large share of the growth in allocations to government agencies. As a 
result, employment is not likely to show strong growth in this sector in 2003.

 Growth  in  the  Norwegian  economy  was  sustained  by  a  strong  increase  in  household  consumption 
through  2002.  In  line  with  expectations,  the  sharp  rise  in  real  wages  fuelled  particularly  high 
consumption growth last autumn. 
There are now signs that the strong growth in consumption may be slowing. Household expectations 
are  lower  than  earlier  and  expectations  concerning  their  own  financial  situation  have  also  fallen 
markedly.

 Household  borrowing  is  remains  high  and  the  debt  burden  is  still  on  the  rise.  Growth  in  credit  to 
households  has  slowed  in  recent  months,  but  growth  remains  at  a  double-digit  level.  On  the  other 
hand, the sharp rise in house prices in recent years seems to be levelling off. This may also result in 
lower credit growth through the winter and spring.

 The sharp rise in electricity prices may lead to lower growth in consumption this year. Higher electricity 
expenses reduce household purchasing power. Many enterprises will also be facing higher costs. On 
the other hand, high electricity prices generate revenues for central and local government.

Higher  electricity  prices  will  result  in  a  sharp  increase  in  the  consumer  price  index  this  winter.  The 
year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index may approach 4 per cent in January and 
February. Underlying inflation will also be affected. For example, this can be the result of higher rents 
and  higher  costs  in  some  business  sectors.  However,  these  effects  can  to  a  large  extent  be 
disregarded.  Assuming  that  weather  conditions  remain  fairly  normal  over  the  next  year,  the  rise  in 
prices  at  the  same  time  next  year  will  be  that  much  lower.  Electricity  prices  will  then  make  a 
comparable negative contribution to overall inflation. 
Conclusion 
In  retrospect,  developments  over  the  past  decade  feature  several  elements  of  a  normal  business 
cycle.  Following  a  long  period  of  expansion  in  the  1990s,  the  economy  is  stagnating  as  a  result  of 
overheating in the labour market, high wage growth and high borrowing in the private sector.  
The new guidelines for monetary policy were introduced in March 2001 when there were pressures in 
the economy, expectations of increased use of petroleum revenues and growing divergence between 
cyclical  developments  in  Norway  and  abroad.  Today,  after  close  to  two  years  of  inflation  targeting, 
experience shows that monetary policy has an impact on inflation. In this respect, the experience has 
been uplifting. 
  Future developments are uncertain. Our internationally exposed sectors may be hard hit because this 
time the tightening has to a large extent been the result of a strong krone and a downturn in our export 
markets. It may take time to address the problems associated  with  wage formation after last  year’s 
wage settlement. The oil market is volatile, influenced by fears of war in Iraq and political unrest in 
Venezuela. Our main impression is nevertheless that the economy will grow in the period ahead, albeit 
at  a  somewhat  slower  pace.  When  cyclical  developments  in  Norway  and  abroad  again  converge, 
interest rates in Norway will be closer to the level abroad. The krone will then also return to a more 
normal level. The effects on the krone of the extraordinary situation in the oil market will also pass.
