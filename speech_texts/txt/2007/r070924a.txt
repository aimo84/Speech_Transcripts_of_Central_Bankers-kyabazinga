Jean-Pierre Roth: The euro – a stabilising factor in the international 
currency system 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the 
Swiss  National  Bank  and  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Bank  for  International 
Settlements, at the Fondation Jean Monnet pour l'Europe, Lausanne, 21 September 2007. 
The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 The  euro  is  undoubtedly  a  success  story.  It  has  contributed  to  stabilising  the  international 
currency  system.  In  Europe,  the  former  monetary  disorder  has  been  replaced  by  a  new 
monetary  order.  The  European  payment  system  has  become  more  transparent  and  price 
stability is guaranteed. 
Switzerland,  too,  is  benefiting  from  European  currency  stability.  The  Swiss  franc  is  taking 
advantage of a monetary environment that is considerably calmer than previously. The euro 
and the franc are coexisting very successfully. 
Nevertheless, it would be wrong to claim that all the effects of European currency integration 
have already worked their way through to the real economy. In spurring on competition and 
promoting  transparency,  the  euro  is  having  an  integrating  effect.  However,  there  are  still 
considerable obstacles standing in the way of this integration process.
