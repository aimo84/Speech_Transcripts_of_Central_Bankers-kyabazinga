European Central Bank: Press briefing â€“ transcript 
Transcript by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, following the 
meeting of the Governing Council, Frankfurt am Main, 2 August 2007. 
 Let me just say a few words and then I will be ready to respond to questions, as usual. 
Recent  economic  developments  and  survey  indicators  confirm  that  sustained  economic 
growth  continued  in  the  euro  area  through  the second  quarter.  Rising oil  prices,  emerging 
capacity  constraints  and  the  potential  for  stronger  wage  and  cost  dynamics,  among  other 
factors, imply upside risks to price stability over the medium term. The existence of upside 
risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons is confirmed by the strength of the 
underlying rate of monetary expansion: strong vigilance is therefore of the essence to ensure 
that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise.  
Both,  our  previous  economic  and  monetary  analysis  as  expressed  in  particular  in  the  last 
press  conference  have  been  fully  confirmed  by  the  ongoing  information  we  have  received 
since  the  last  meeting  of  the  Governing  Council.  Let  me  also  stress  that  we  never  pre-
commit, we decide at the moment of the meeting of the Governing Council on the basis of 
the  information  that  we  have,  facts  and  figures,  and  according  to  the  judgement  that  we 
make at that moment. I re-emphasise that we never pre-commit.  
Let me also say that we are experiencing a period of market nervousness, a period where we 
see  volatility  in  markets  in  general  and  re-appreciation  of  risks.  We  think  that  these 
developments in financial markets deserve attention. Shifts in market sentiment need careful 
monitoring. We will continue to pay great attention to the developments in the market over 
the period to come.  
I am now open to questions.
