Introduction 
Mr.  President  of  the  Senate’s  Finance  Commission,  Senator  Ricardo  Lagos,  senators 
members of this Commission, ladies, gentlemen. 
Thank you for inviting me to present the vision of the Board of the Central Bank of Chile on 
recent  financial  and  macroeconomic  developments,  their  prospects  and  implications  for 
monetary and financial policy. This vision is detailed in our Monetary Policy Report (IPoM) of 
June 2014 and in our Financial Stability Report (IEF) of the first half of 2014. 
Domestic output and demand have been slowing down for some months now. The drop in 
investment  that  began  a  few  quarters  ago  has  been  compounded  with  weaker  private 
consumption. As a matter of fact, in the forecast scenario I will be describing briefly we have 
revised  downward  our  growth  estimate  for  2014,  as  a  result  from  this  behavior  of  private 
consumption and the larger than expected fall in investment. 
Abroad, the trends we have depicted in our latest Monetary Policy Reports have not varied 
much.  The  developed  world  is  showing  sustained  recovery  while  at  the  same  time  the 
emerging  world  is  decelerating. One  point  worth  noting  is that the  volatility  of  international 
financial markets has diminished. 
In the domestic monetary policy front, a significant development of recent months has been 
increased  inflation,  which  is  now  above  4 percent  in  annual  terms.  Although  this  was 
expected to some extent because of inflation’s previous level and especially because of the 
normal pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation to domestic prices, the actual figure 
exceeded not only our latest IPoM’s forecasts but also private expectations. 
Our  projection  scenario  assumes  that  inflation  rising  above  4  percent  is  a  temporary 
phenomenon and that it will return to 3 percent annually within our normal monetary policy 
horizon,  a  vision  that  is also  reflected  in  medium-term  private  inflation expectations,  which 
have remained at 3 percent. In this context, the Board has communicated that it will consider 
the possibility of making additional cuts to the monetary policy rate in line with the evolution 
of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions and its implications on the inflationary 
outlook. 
The  slowdown  in  output  and  demand  should  take  pressure  off  future  prices,  but  in  an 
environment  of  already  expansionary  monetary  policy  and  where  prices  have  risen  above 
projections,  it  is  necessary  that  the  Central  Bank  carefully  weigh  the  risks  surrounding  its 
decisions. 
Let me now share with you our baseline scenario and the main risks we have covered in the 
two reports I am presenting. 
Macroeconomic scenario 
The y-o-y variation of the different CPI measurements has increased significantly in recent 
months, and as I said, more than foreseen. Headline CPI went from 1.5 percent annually in 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 1 
  October 2013 to 4.7 percent in May 2014 (figure 1). We expected this rise in inflation to some 
degree, because it came from a low level and the peso depreciation we have been observing 
since mid-last year also had an impact. A look into inflation rates over the past six months 
shows that the biggest increase has concentrated in those components of core inflation of 
goods  and  services  whose  prices  are  connected  –  directly  or  indirectly  –  to  the  exchange 
rate (figure 2). We have also seen an acceleration of nominal wages in recent months. 
Inflation  has  behaved  thus  in  a  context  of  sharply  decelerating  output  and  demand.  In  the 
first quarter this year, output grew 2.6 percent annually, confirming the slowdown that began 
in the third quarter of 2013. Overall, this outcome was in line with forecasts, but composition 
shifted towards higher growth in those areas more closely linked to the external sector – like 
some branches of manufacturing and agriculture – and slower growth in those areas tied to 
domestic demand, especially services. 
Leaving  out  inventories,  y-o-y  growth  in  domestic  demand  picked  up  from  end-of  2013, 
basically  due  to  a  milder  drop  in  investment  –  especially  its  machinery  &  equipment 
component  –  and  increased  dynamism  of  public  expenditure.  Domestic  spending  is  still 
weak, however. Investment has posted negative variation rates for three quarters in a row, 
while  private  consumption,  mainly  of  durables,  is  slowing  down  (figure  3).  Inventories  fell 
substantially in the first quarter, partly due to the rebound of mining exports, but there is also 
less disposition to keep inventories in other sectors. Business confidence in the industry, as 
measured by the Indicator of Business Confidence (IMCE), has declined significantly and the 
domestic-demand-related sectors are below neutral, as of last May. The lower growth in final 
demand and the larger increase in exports have also translated into a faster reduction of the 
current account deficit, which closed the first quarter at 3.1 percent of GDP (3.4 percent in 
end-of 2013). At trend prices, the current account deficit has also been adjusted substantially 
(figure 4). 
Despite two quarters of economic slowdown, the unemployment rate is still low by historical 
standards.  Some  deterioration  has  been  seen  in  salaried  job  creation,  counteracted  by  a 
surge  in  self-employment.  Vacancies  are  also  growing  less.  At  any  rate,  nominal  wages 
showed an acceleration, but this becomes a moderation when expressed in real terms. 
Since last October, the Board has cut 100 basis points off the policy rate, helping to reduce 
short-term interest rates and also long-term financing costs, on occasion to record-low levels. 
For instance, interest rates on Central Bank indexed bonds at 5 and 10 years are in historical 
minimums, while the nominal rates of the same bonds are near them (figure 5). As pointed 
out  in  our  IEF  Report,  in  the  local  corporate  markets  the  lower  risk  premiums  have  also 
helped  to  improve  financing  conditions,  which  have  been  showing  sustained  improvement 
since mid-last year and into 2014 to date (figure 6). Despite the lower cost of credit, banking 
credit has expanded less in recent months, mainly in commercial loans, which relate to the 
financing of inventories, working capital and fixed assets. Aside from demand-side factors, 
the  Bank  Lending  Survey  shows  that  credit  access  conditions  have  tightened  in  recent 
months.  The  opinions  taken  from  April’s  Business  Perceptions  Report  agree  with  this 
assessment. In contrast, annual growth in mortgage credit posted a slight increase, which is 
attributed to the completion of various real estate projects and committed sales. 
International financial markets look calmer than in the second half of 2013 and early 2014. 
Thanks  to  this  the  stock  markets  improved,  sovereign  risk  premiums  and  long-term  rates 
declined,  and  emerging  market  currencies  appreciated.  Why?  Because  of  a  number  of 
factors. On one hand, in the U.S. the withdrawal of unconventional stimulus measures has 
proceeded  as  expected  and  the  Eurozone  has  made  advances  on  the  fiscal  and  banking 
fronts. In the latter, there are also additional monetary measures recently applied to avert a 
deflation. On the other hand, in China risks are still present affecting the financial system and 
economic growth. The authorities have announced some focalized fiscal stimulus packages 
and capital market reforms, and the latest stress tests showed good capital adequacy levels.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  Regarding global activity, a stronger growth outlook has consolidated in developed economies 
together with a slowdown in the emerging world. Still, some downward adjustments are being 
made to the projections for this year, mostly driven by actual first-quarter data, leading to a 
marginal adjustment in the overall figure. Thus, it is expected that in the period 2014–2015 our 
trading partners will grow 3.7 percent on average, a tenth of a point less than was expected in 
March. In Latin America a less favorable picture emerges. Downward revisions in Argentina, 
Brazil and Mexico stand out in these settings. The price of copper has fluctuated significantly 
in recent months. After coming close to US$3.15 per pound, it returned to the order of US$3. 
The baseline scenario assumes copper prices of 3.1 and 2.9 dollars per pound in 2014 and 
2015,  respectively.  The  terms  of  trade  would  fall  this  year  slightly  less  than  projected  the 
March IPoM, but somewhat deeper in 2015 (table 1). Inflation has remained well contained in 
developed countries, while in emerging markets, particularly in Latin America, the short-term 
outlook has been revised upwards, reflecting the depreciation of Latin American currencies in 
the past year. This, plus the changes in parities mean that foreign dollar inflation this year and 
next will be somewhat higher than forecast in the last Report. 
The  Board  estimates  that  in  the  baseline  projection  scenario,  inflation  in  Chile  will  remain 
above 4 percent still for some months, ending 2014 around that figure. In the course of 2015 
it will decline further, reaching values around 3 percent in the first half of next year, to stay 
there  until  the  end  of  the  projection  horizon,  this  time  the  second  quarter  of  2016.  Core 
inflation,  which  is  now  below  headline  inflation,  should  also  fall  in  the  coming  months, 
hovering around 3 percent as from the first half of 2015 (figure 7). 
The  baseline  scenario  assumes  that  the  economic  slowdown  will  reduce  domestic 
inflationary pressures, thus helping inflation to return to 3 percent within the forecast horizon. 
Accordingly, the Board estimates that this year the economy will grow in the range of 2.5 to 
3.5  percent,  less  than  foreseen  in  March  (3  to  4  percent).  This  revision  responds  to  the 
weakening  of  domestic-demand-related  sectors  in  the  first  quarter  of  this  year.  Private 
expectations  have  seen  a  similar  change  during  the  period.  According  to  our  Economic 
Expectations  Survey  (EES),  the  growth  estimate  for  the  year  dropped  from  3.7  percent  to 
3.0 percent between March and June. 
The  baseline  scenario  assumes  that  the  economy  will  slowly  regain  strength  towards  the 
second half of this year, with annual expansion increasing towards the latter months of 2014. 
This projection assumes some degree of investment payback, given the costs of internal and 
external  financing.  The  MPR  has  been  lowered  by  100  basis  points  over  the  past  few 
quarters and, as already mentioned, long-term interest rates are at their lowest in recorded 
history,  even  below  those  that  prevailed  in  the  2009  recession.  Also  risk  premiums  have 
diminished. There is also the effect of net exports, part of which we saw in the first quarter, 
resulting from both higher prices in dollars and the reallocation of internal resources derived 
from the real depreciation of the currency. Add that the developed world will perform better. 
Finally, there is the impulse coming from public spending, particularly investment, because of 
the low budget execution of 2013. In the opposite direction point the aforesaid deterioration 
in business confidence and the downward revisions to the investment project agenda made 
by the Chilean capital goods corporation for 2014. 
The  2014  current  account  deficit  forecast  is  revised  downwards  mainly  because  of  the 
foreseen deceleration in investment and a slight increase in savings because of lower private 
consumption. In the trade balance this is visible mainly in a downward revision to imports. 
Accordingly, the baseline scenario includes a current account deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP in 
2014  (3.6  percent  in  March).  The  lower  outlook  for  expenditure  also  implies  that,  at  trend 
prices, the deficit will decline further, to 2.2 percent of GDP (3 percent in March) (table 2). 
The  forecast  path  for  inflation  rests  on  several  assumptions.  For  one,  in  that  the  pass-
through  from  the  peso  depreciation  to  prices  will  be  in  line  with  its  historical  pattern.  In 
addition, the Board uses as a methodological assumption that the real exchange rate (RER) 
will remain close to current values, as it is now within the range that is considered consistent 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 3 
  with its long-term fundamentals. It also uses as a working assumption that nominal wages 
will be adjusted in line with productivity and the inflation target. The baseline scenario also 
uses as a methodological assumption that the MPR will follow a path comparable to that that 
can be inferred from the prices of financial assets outstanding at the statistical closing of this 
Monetary Policy Report (figure 8). 
The baseline scenario reflects the events that are believed to be more likely to occur with the 
information at hand at the closing of this Report. However, there are risk scenarios which, if 
materialized,  may  reshape  the  macroeconomic  outlook  and  thus  the  course  of  monetary 
policy. This time, having evaluated the alternative scenarios, the Board believes that the risk 
balance for both output and inflation, is unbiased. 
Internationally,  the  biggest  risk  continues  to  be  linked  to  the  Chinese  economy  and  its 
financial  system.  This  risk  has  significant  impact,  considering  China’s  weight  in  the 
commodities market, copper included, and its importance in world trade. Besides, one cannot 
rule  out  the  vulnerabilities  in  other  emerging  economies  resulting  in  new  episodes  of 
volatility.  The  risks  relating  with  the  United  States  withdrawing  its  monetary  stimulus 
programs and the Eurozone’s macro-financial situation have diminished, but are still capable 
of widening the fluctuations in the global financial markets. In particular, the current context 
of  lower  sovereign  premiums  could  trigger  a  sharper  reversal.  Still,  the  improved 
performance of the U.S. economy would also mean a stronger impulse from abroad. 
Locally, the main risk has to do with the short-term inflation outlook. The baseline scenario 
assumes that inflation will be temporarily above 4 percent and will return to 3 percent over 
the course of 2015. This will partly be the result of the economic slowdown of recent quarters 
will give way to lower inflationary pressures going forward. There are risks, however, as it is 
difficult to gauge the actual sizes of output gaps and sales margins. For instance, the labor 
market is still tight by historical standards and relative to the recent evolution of GDP, which 
could influence the inertia and sensitivity of nominal wages to actual inflation. However, other 
labor market indicators, such as the behavior of salaried employment and vacancies suggest 
that gaps are also building up in this sector. 
A second risk in the domestic economy has to do with the poor performance of investment 
over the past few quarters. Although the baseline scenario assumes a slight recovery in the 
near  future,  the  inherent  inertia  of  this  component  may  prolong  said  poor  performance 
beyond forecasts. As a matter of fact, from last September to date the projection of annual 
investment growth in 2014 has been revised downwards by more than 5 percentage points. 
The Financial Stability Report 
Our Financial Stability Report (IEF) discloses semiannually (every June and December), the 
recent macroeconomic and financial developments that could affect the financial stability of 
the Chilean economy. Let me now give you a brief description of some of the main topics 
covered in this issue of the Report. 
This  issue  examines  the  same  external  risk  scenarios  I  just  described.  From  the  financial 
stability standpoint, we conclude that the risks coming from the U.S. and the Eurozone have 
subsided,  shifting  the  focus  to  the  Chinese  economy  as  the  primary  source  of  risk.  The 
Report  also  stresses  that  if  these  scenarios  come  true  they  may  have  consequences  in 
Chile, given the domestic economic slowdown. 
Locally,  corporate  indebtedness  has  increased  in  GDP  terms.  Companies  reporting  to  the 
Superintendence of Securities and Insurance (SVS) are posting relatively high debt levels by 
historic standards and profitability is shrinking. Although these tendencies are consistent with 
corporate patterns observed in other economies, they do signal a reduction in the sector’s 
resilience to possible sharp adjustments in the economy’s dynamic. Finally, in the past year, 
the figures of banking commercial credit repayment have deteriorated somewhat in some of 
the more pro-cyclical sectors, but on aggregate they are still on the favorable side.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  The real-estate market dynamic has not changed much from earlier IEFs. New home sales 
are still strong and inventories are low. In this context, various indicators show that housing 
prices continued to rise in 2013 (figure 9). Although the upward trend is generalized across 
geographic zones, some are increasing faster than others (figure 10). 
The office space market has increased the vacancy rate, and is expected to increase further 
as new projects enter the market. Still, it is worth mentioning that recent quarters’ indicators 
show a slight decline in the percentage of loans that cover a high portion of the property’s 
value,  the  Bank  Lending  Survey  reports  somewhat  tightened  credit  standards  and  the 
business  cycle  has  resulted  in  a  slower  pace  of  total  lending  growth,  although  mortgage 
credit shows a smoother trend. 
I cannot stress too much how important it is for the agents involved to consider when making 
their investment and financing decisions that the future behavior of prices might take a detour 
away from recent trends. 
Household borrowing risks remain stable. Total household debt rose a little in the last quarter 
of 2013. In banking debt, there continues to be a shift in composition towards middle to upper 
income, with faster growth in borrowed amounts than in the number of debtors. Repayment 
indicators for both bank and non-bank providers show no major change, probably because of 
a  change  in  composition  of  the  consumer  portfolio  or  because  a  milder  impact  of  the 
business cycle on the labor market. 
Banks  have  been  gradually  reducing  growth  in  commercial  credit  and,  while  less,  also 
consumer credit, reacting to the economic slowdown. Indicators also show a reduction in the 
exposure to the most pro-cyclical sectors, which has been visible in stable aggregate default 
levels  in  both  portfolios.  Banks’  profitability  increased  somewhat  in  the  past  few  quarters, 
while  their  capitalization  levels  have  remained  stable.  Stress  tests  show  that  the  banking 
system’s  capital  levels  are  still  sufficient  to  absorb  the  materialization  of  a  severe  stress 
scenario, although if such conditions occur it would affect profits somewhat more than was 
assessed in previous IEFs. 
The  less  favorable  stage  of  the  cycle  could  imply  higher  credit  risks.  On  one  hand,  those 
households more exposed to the cycle  would take a turn for the worse  in their repayment 
behavior  should  the  labor  weaken significantly. On the  other  hand,  the deterioration  in  the 
past  year  of  some  economic  sectors  in  the  commercial  portfolios  could  intensify  if  the 
slowdown  becomes  sharper.  Thus,  the  level  of  provisions  set  aside  in  each  case  is  one 
important element that could cushion the impact of such risks. 
As I said, funding costs are low, with near record-low long-term real interest rates. However, 
one  cannot  rule  out  a  reversal  or  new  episodes  of  volatility.  Thus,  it  is  still  important  to 
diversify  by  sources  and  maturities  of  external  and  internal  credit.  A  large  segment  of  the 
banking industry has advanced in that direction, but some smaller banks continue to depend 
heavily on local wholesale suppliers. 
Some reflections to wrap up. 
Final remarks 
We have been seeing a rise in inflation for some months that has taken y-o-y figures up past 
4  percent.  The  forecasts  in  this  Monetary  Policy  Report  indicate  that  this  is  a  temporary 
development  associated  with  the  depreciation  of  our  currency,  and  private  expectations 
corroborate  this,  as  a  normalization  of  inflation  over  the  coming  months  is  foreseen.  The 
Board of the Central Bank of Chile continues to monitor this situation with special attention. 
At the same time, the Chile economy is in a phase of slowdown in output and demand. As 
we  have  said  before,  a  significant  part  of  this  slowdown  is  due  to  how  our  economy  is 
affected  by  the  developments  in  the  world  economy  and  the  normalization  of  our  exports’ 
prices. The weakening of mining investments had taken a toll on the labor market and other 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 5 
  sectors  of  the  national  economy.  The  expectations  of  entrepreneurs  and  consumers  have 
moderated further lately, anticipating that the domestic demand will provide a milder impulse 
in the coming months. 
Our policy framework equips us with tools to alleviate the consequences of a more adverse 
scenario. Monetary policy has stepped in to reduce financing costs, while the exchange rate 
depreciation  has  allowed  relative  prices  to  adjust  driving  a  change  in  composition  towards 
tradable sectors and external demand, reducing the effects on output and employment. At 
the same time, as the recovery of developed economies consolidates, it will open the door to 
markets that have been very depressed for some years. 
Our projections suggest that this year our economy will grow 2.5 to 3.5 percent, anticipating 
a stabilization and gradual recovery of economic growth. A number of factors should help in 
this recovery, including the better performance of the developed  world, the depreciation of 
the real exchange rate, the stronger monetary stimulus, the low funding costs for the short 
and the long term, and the greater fiscal impulse. 
Nevertheless, I must stress that under the current conditions it is also important to keep an 
eye  on  the  supply  side  of  the  economy  and  advance  in  every  measure  favoring  stronger 
growth  in  productivity.  The  Administration  has  recently  announced  a  series  of  initiatives 
intended to improve our country’s capacity for innovation and growth, as well as an energy 
agenda with specific goals to reduce costs both upstream and downstream. These measures 
are vital in our current context, since the capacity of our domestic firms to absorb high costs 
will be more constrained with normalized terms of trade like we expect for the coming years. 
Working  out  these  issues  will  permit  giving  a  sustainable  impulse  over  the  years  to 
investment, growth, and employment. 
Summing up, inflation has risen beyond expectations a few months back, while the economy 
is in a phase of slow growth. After lowering the MPR in October 2013 and March 2014, the 
Board has kept the MPR at 4 percent over the past few months. Overall, in this juncture we 
believe  that  this  slowdown  will  reduce  inflationary  pressures,  helping  inflation  to  return  to 
3 percent  in  the  policy  horizon.  Monetary  policy  is  already  in  an  expansionary  stance  and 
both  domestic  and  external  financing  conditions  are  good.  The  Board  reaffirms  its 
commitment with the inflation target and will take every action necessary to ensure that it will 
return  to  3 percent  annually  within  the  policy  horizon.  It  also  reiterates  the  need  for  all 
financial system participants to properly assess their borrowing and lending conditions. We, 
as the Central Bank, will continue to contribute with what is our duty – that is, safeguarding 
the stability of our currency and the normal functioning of internal and external payments – to 
Chile’s development and welfare. 
Thank you.
