José De Gregorio: Global confidence crisis – the value of waiting and the 
coordination failures revisited  
Keynote  speech  by  Mr  José  De  Gregorio,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  at  the 
opening  of  the  Post-Graduate  Program  of  the  School  of  Economics  and  Business 
Administration of Universidad de Chile, Santiago, 4 June 2009. 
I wish to thank Pablo García and Enrique Orellana for their helpful contributions and comments. 
 “When,  as  today,  the  unknown  unknowns  dominate,  and  the  economic 
environment is so complex as to appear nearly incomprehensible, the result is 
extreme prudence, if not outright paralysis, on the part of investors, consumers 
and firms. And this behaviour, in turn, feeds the crisis.” (Blanchard, 2009). 
I  want  to  begin  by  thanking  you  for  inviting  me  to  open  the  academic  year  of  the  Post-
Graduate Program of the School of Economics and Business Administration at Universidad 
de Chile. Most of my presentations are for an audience that is primarily interested in learning 
about the Bank’s view on the economy, so my lectures tend to focus largely on the national 
and international junctures and their prospects. On this occasion, I will take advantage of the 
academic  setting  that  brought  us  together,  and  the  freedom  I  was  given  to  choose  the 
subject, to refer to a central aspect of the current global crisis, namely the confidence crisis, 
focusing on some key concepts that can help us understand what is going on at this global 
economic juncture. 
The  natural  question  here  is:  what  was  the  ingredient  that  led  the  financial  events  of  mid-
September of last year to end up the way they did? The developed world entered a severe 
recession, and output dropped simultaneously in most countries. The crisis spread around 
the world like a virus, with unprecedented and, of course, unforeseen strength and speed, 
making no distinctions among economies’ strengths or weaknesses (Figure 1).  
What  happened?  Why  was  there  no  differentiation?  How  could  such  massive  contagion 
occur? Why the synchrony? All of these are very important questions in understanding how 
the crisis was transmitted and how we will make it through. If there is one thing that is difficult 
to explain it is the intensity of its impact. In Chile, neither the path that the domestic economic 
cycle was experiencing nor the analysis of traditional transmission channels for an external 
crisis  –  that  is,  financial  and  commercial  channels  –  are  capable  of  fully  explaining  what 
happened (De Gregorio, 2009).  
The  hypothesis  that  seems  to  have  most  ground  at  the  moment  is  that  a  deterioration  in 
global  confidence,  understood  as  a  worsening  of  expectations  and  increased  uncertainty 
around  the  world,  has  amplified  the  response to  the  initial  impact,  pushing  us  into  a  more 
acute and synchronized crisis than we could envision at first. 
It  helps  to  study  the  historical  relationships  among  the  data  if  cycles  and  patterns  tend  to 
repeat themselves on a regular basis. But in the current crisis, which has no precedents in 
many  decades,  to  look  at  simple  correlations  based  on  normal  periods  can  be  very 
misleading.  From  my  standpoint,  it  is  more  important  to  conceptualize  what  is  happening 
today, in order to analyze the prospects of the economy and draw policy conclusions. 
To address this subject I will use some basic economics that will allow us to understand the 
synchrony and severity of the current crisis. These arguments have been present for many 
years in the profession and have gained enormous importance today. The first refers to the 
existence of multiple equilibria and the effect of failed coordination. The second deals with 
the  effect  of  uncertainty  on  economic  decision  making.  These  two  elements  help  us 
understand how the confidence crisis that swept the world aggravated the output contraction, 
hitting hardest the demand for industrial goods. In the next section I will describe the main

ideas  that  clarify  the  impact  of  the  confidence  crisis,  and  then  analyze  the  international 
scenario in the following section. 
Some basic ideas 
The objective here is to account for the basic ideas behind the coordination failures, multiple 
equilibria and how uncertainty affects aggregate demand. 
Coordination failures 
Let us assume a very simple economy1 with a large number of consumers. Each consumer 
demands D units of a manufactured good, which we can think of as a durable good (e.g., car, 
house, appliance, electronic device). We can also think of durable goods demanded by firms 
when they invest (e.g., machinery and equipment, warehouses, plants).  
The  demand  of  consumers  and  firms  is  a  function  of  their  expectations  of  future  income, 
directly related with the expected value of aggregate output in the economy. Y will denote the 
level  of  output  and  EY  its  future  expected  value.  We  will  also  assume  that  the  demand 
depends on the level of uncertainty which we will call σ and I will discuss later. For now, it is 
enough  to  consider  that  the  demand  falls  when  uncertainty  grows.  Thus,  the  demand  for 
goods is represented by D(EY,σ). 
Firms, in this example, produce what is demanded from them.2 Normalizing the population of 
firms  and  consumers  to  1,  the  equilibrium  will  occur  when  the  demand  equals  the  supply 
(Y=D). In equilibrium under rational expectations, product must be equal to expected product, 
or: 
Y=D(Y,σ) 
Now, with a couple more assumptions we can find the equilibrium (Figure 2). The equilibrium 
is  unique  in  A.  For  this,  the  demand  is  assumed  to  be  concave,  that  is,  any  additional 
demand  for  goods  is  smaller  as  income  increases.  To  ensure  a  unique  equilibrium  we 
assume that, for EY=0, the demand for the good is positive. This can be understood as the 
individual having another source of income and expenses, and always wanting to devote part 
of the other income to consume this good. Another simple way of seeing it is to think that the 
individual will want to borrow to acquire this good, even if her income is very low, presumably 
because she always expects to have the funds available in the future to repay. As we will 
see, however, it is possible that multiple equilibria exist, with low and high output, as a result 
of coordination failures.  
Uncertainty and the value of waiting 
Decision  making  under  uncertainty  has  always  been  a  complex  thing  to  study.  Often  to 
simplify, we turn to quadratic specifications in order to use certainty equivalence. Surely this 
                                                 
1   This exercise is based on an MIT class exercise which, despite having saved my notes and after a number of 
inquiries with friends, I have been unable to find. The original model was somewhat more complex because it 
assumed strategic interactions among firms, and here the demand is only taken as given. More formal models 
were developed in Cooper and John (1988). For a thorough review of this literature, see Cooper (1999).  
 Note that because this is only an illustration, many aspects were left out of the analysis. In this case we are 
assuming that there is some friction in the price-setting mechanism that prevents firms from selling all they 
want at a given price. This friction may come from firms deciding how much to produce before they know the 
demand,  which  would lead  us to incorporate the producers’ decisions  to this story. Analytically, however, it 
would not change much.

falls  short  of  describing  the  much  more  complex  reality;  for  example,  when  the  analysis 
considers decisions to invest or consume (durables) in the presence of irreversibilities.3  
When a decision is irreversible, there is no chance to back out; for example, an investment is 
made for which no secondary market exists to liquidate it. The purchase of a durable good is 
another case. We know, however, that in general there will always be some way to get rid of 
the good, but part of its cost is impossible to recover – it is a sunk cost. A firm can build a 
plant,  for  instance,  but  to  get  rid  of  it  the  firm  will  have  to  resell  it  below  cost  because  of 
specific features that prospective buyers will not appreciate.  
In an environment of certainty, expenses will be incurred whenever the benefits outweigh the 
costs. Therefore, the choice is between spending and not spending. But with uncertainty and 
irreversibility,  the  choice  is  no  longer  between  spending  and  not  spending,  but  rather 
between spending, not spending, and waiting. This option has a value, because as time goes 
by, uncertainty fades. 
Thus, the more uncertain a choice is, the more profitable it is to wait. Imagine the case of a 
firm having to invest. Such investment consists of enlarging its facilities and purchasing new 
capital goods. If things go right, the investment will be very profitable. If things go wrong, the 
benefits of investing will be very low, and the present value of the project will be negative. 
Hence, had the firm known that things were going to go wrong, it would have preferred not to 
invest. If the passing of time helps to know with more certainty whether things will go right or 
wrong, the firm may find it convenient to wait and see. Waiting permits it to keep the choice 
between investing and not investing open, which is not the case when the investment has 
already  been  made.  Thus  the investment  can be  analyzed  with  the  theory  of  options.  The 
firm  must  balance  the  cost  of  postponing  the  investment  with  the  benefit  of  learning  more 
about the situation and making a better informed decision. Then, the larger the uncertainty, 
the greater the benefit of waiting.  
This same logic can be applied to a consumer that must decide on the purchase of a durable 
good, but is uncertain about his future income. If the probability of losing his job increases, it 
may be advisable to wait before making the decision. Although this analysis is very simple 
intuitively, it is not easy to formalize. A consumer can sell his car or an electronic device if he 
loses  his  income,  but  it  will  be  at  a  cost.  The  higher  this  cost,  the  more  irreversible  the 
decision becomes.4
This idea permits us to explain why the decision to wait and see can be optimal and permits 
us to justify why demand, D, depends negatively on uncertainty, σ. 
The increase in uncertainty and the fall in demand 
What is critical about this analysis is that it can be very important from a quantitative point of 
view.  The  decision  is  not  marginal.  An  increase  in  uncertainty  does  not  result  in  “some” 
decrease in spending. An uncertainty shock that is common to all  will lead every firm and 
every consumer to paralyze spending, causing a collapse in demand.  
The  main  point  is  that  this  fall  can  be  so  sharp  that  one  can  even  have  more  than  one 
possible equilibrium (Figure 3). This could be the case if households decide to increase their 
savings significantly, such that low-income families would rather not spend on durable goods. 
The same could be true if firms decide not to invest. Thus, households and firms would delay 
                                                 
3   For the case of irreversible investment, Dixit and Pindyck (1994) provide a very thorough analysis. A simple 
example is presented in De Gregorio (2007), chapter 4. 
Implications like the ones described here can be inferred from the precautionary savings theory. In order to 
avoid  the  cost  in  lost  utility  of  extreme  negative  events,  the  consumer  chooses  to  keep  some  buffer-stock 
savings.  If  uncertainty  aggravates,  for  example  by  increasing  the  dispersion  of  future  earnings,  then 
precautionary saving will probably increase, which is done by postponing consumption decisions.

their  decisions  to  spend  on  durable  goods,  awaiting  uncertainty  to  clear  up.  Households, 
however,  would  continue  to  spend  on  non-durables.  Actually,  the  share  of  goods  like 
foodstuff  in  the  total  consumption  basket  would  increase.  Durable  and  investment  goods, 
meanwhile, are the ones subject to this wait and see strategy and, by their own nature, their 
purchase can be postponed.  
Thus, there are two possible equilibria: B and C, both with output below the original level A. 
Furthermore, we can think that in case C the loss of confidence is very big, which magnifies 
the  fall  in  demand  that  may  result  from  a  cyclical  adjustment.  In  such  a  case  pessimism 
dominates. Everyone thinks that economic activity will fall due to increased uncertainty and 
that  is  exactly  what  happens,  so  pessimism  is  justified.  This  point  is  more  general:  facing 
multiple equilibria, how do private expectations coordinate for the economy to converge to 
one or the other? Evidently there is no natural mechanism, so failed coordination can easily 
lead the economy to settle in the worst equilibrium. 
The exercise I have presented is pretty simple and it surely overlooks many relevant aspects, 
especially the dynamics that might allow us to analyze the loss of confidence. It is still helpful 
because it explains why the increase in uncertainty triggered by the deterioration in output 
and the financial crisis deepens the fall in output, whose effects can be substantial. 
Let me proceed, then, by showing you what has been happening in the world and in Chile 
and  how  we  can  observe  the  increase  in  uncertainty  in  agents’  expectations  and  its 
propagation around the globe. 
The global crisis of confidence 
I will start by listing the main aspects I will be focusing on: 
• 
The synchrony of this crisis is unprecedented. The drop in output made no distinction 
among economies’ strengths or weaknesses. 
Global uncertainty and distrust were particularly acute towards the end of last year. 
The severe drop in demand was concentrated largely in durable goods. Investment 
and consumption of these products collapsed by the end of 2008. 
 To contextualize this episode, I will begin by recalling that a debate about the accumulation 
of  strong  global  imbalances  had  been  going  on  for  several  years,  focusing  on  their 
implications  and  ways  to  correct  them.  The  Central  Bank  of  Chile  identified  them  as  a 
significant risk in many of its Monetary Policy Reports. Meanwhile, the world proceeded with 
very unusual dynamism. World GDP grew by an annual average of nearly 5 percent between 
2004 and 2007, while commodity prices increased manifold. Copper, for instance, went from 
selling at about US$1.00 per pound in late 2003 to approaching and even briefly surpassing 
$4.00 during April and July 2008. Oil went from trading at around 30 to 35 dollars per barrel 
in late 2003 to close to 150 dollars last July. Meanwhile, in the United States, the subprime 
mortgage crisis had already erupted in mid 2007, and by March 2008 an important financial 
institution, Bear Stearns, had collapsed. 
An important point of this preamble of the facts of September 2008 is that the string of events 
I  just  mentioned  had  no  significant  effect  on  economic  expectations, nor  did  it  change  the 
mean of expected growth or increase uncertainty. This, despite the fact that the Bear Stearns 
bankruptcy was a very significant occurrence for the international financial market. Actually, 
the volatility of stock markets went up a rung in mid-2007, but was pretty mild if compared 
with September 2008 (Figure 4). This stock volatility index (VIX), which is normally used as a 
4 
 BIS Review 76/2009
good indicator of uncertainty,5 shows how it increased several times during the peak of the 
crisis in September and October of last year. The latest figures show uncertainty declining, 
although it remains high.  
Thus,  according  to  market  consensus,  world  growth  for  2008-2009  posted  no  significant 
changes between March and September of 2008 (Figure 5). The situation in Chile did not 
differ  much  (Figure  6).  During  the  whole  of  2007,  growth  projections  for  2008  fluctuated 
around 5 percent, even after the eruption of the housing crisis in the United States. At the 
time of Bear Stearns’ bankruptcy there had been some adjustment in expected growth for the 
year,  but  in  September  there  was  even  a  slight  correction  upwards.  The  Bank’s  forecasts 
were similar. The growth projections for 2009 are not so different; actually the larger part of 
the  correction  was  done  after  December  2008.  In  sum,  since  September  a  significant 
correction has been applied to the expected value for growth. 
In addition to a smaller forecast for future earnings, there has been an increase in related 
uncertainty  (Figure  7).  In  the  United  States,  in  early  2008,  the  width  of  the  distribution  of 
growth  projections  for  2009  was  2  percentage  points.  In  early  2009,  the  same  width 
increased to 2.3 percentage points and, by May, with at least the data for the first quarter of 
the year available, the width was of 3.3 percentage points. In Chile, GDP projections taken 
from  the  Economic  Expectations  Survey  depict  a  similar  picture,  that  is,  the  level  of 
uncertainty among those forecasting growth has been increasing, despite the fact that, as the 
year passes and new data are added, the projections should not only be better but also have 
a smaller degree of uncertainty. 
What  began  happening  in  September  2008  that  changed  so  dramatically  the  economic 
scenario  around  the  world,  Chile  included?  As  I  said  before,  the  simple  observation  of 
traditional  transmission  channels  of  an  external  crisis  cannot  explain  the  events.  On  one 
hand,  financial  conditions  tightened  significantly  worldwide.  The  domestic  financial  system 
also suffered, although without any episodes that might compromise its solvency. However, 
the  possibility  of  reduced  access  to  external  funds,  plus  the  increase  in  global  risk,  put 
pressure on internal financial conditions, causing a significant increase in interest rates and 
lending  standards.  At  the  same  time,  when  future  earnings  became  more  uncertain, 
households and firms significantly reduced their demand for new credit, as revealed by the 
Banking Credit Survey that the Central Bank conducts on a quarterly basis. 
Overall, the tightening of financial conditions was not so severe as to hinder banks’ access to 
external credit or their proper functioning domestically. This was possible also because of a 
set  of  measures  adopted  by  the  Central  Bank  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to  ensure  the 
proper functioning of the financial system. 
Nonetheless, due to the higher uncertainty, the sensation that the world economy might enter 
into a significant depression with huge losses of wealth triggered an unprecedented erosion 
of global confidence. Growth forecasts began adjusting at great speed. Undoubtedly this hit 
the behavior of households and firms hard around the world, which stopped their spending 
plans, or put them on hold indefinitely.  
Consumers’ and entrepreneurs’ expectations indicators showed a profound weakening in the 
last quarter of 2008 (Figure 8). A look at durable goods consumption indicators reveals the 
steep  fall  in  sales  levels  (Figure  9).  All  this  takes  me  back  to  the  previous  point  in  my 
presentation.  The  dramatic  increase  in  uncertainty  that  began  in  September  of  last  year 
altered  people’s  behavior  substantially,  leading  to  an  abrupt  and  sudden  paralysis  of  the 
demand for durable goods. 
                                                 
5   Bloom (2009) presents evidence where the use of this indicator helps to understand the US economic cycle, 
precisely because firms temporarily put their decisions on hold regarding investment and new hirings.

At the world level, the situation wasn’t so different. Expectations of both individuals and firms 
suffered a severe decline (Figure 10). Stock prices around the world dropped dramatically, 
reflecting  the  worsened  expectations  (Figure  11).  The  prices  of  commodities  also  fell 
because  of  the  reduction  in  demand  expected  for  the  future.  The  exception  was  gold, 
commonly used as a store of value at times when perceived risks increase (Figure 12).  
The  drop  in  demand  was  particularly  steep  in  the  manufacturing  sector.  This  explains  the 
severity of the corrections to growth forecasts in countries that export manufactured products 
such as Japan and Germany and the recently industrialized Asian economies, among others. 
These  countries  are  expected  to  experience  an  average  fall  in  GDP  of  around  5  percent 
during this year. 
The main effect of the reduction in world demand on the Chilean economy has been the drop 
in the prices of our exports, and those of many other countries. This pulled down the terms of 
trade and debilitated the national income prospects. However, as I have said a number of 
times  before,  the  impact  of  reduced  demand  is  milder  in  countries  that  export  natural 
resource  related  goods,  like  Chile.  Hence  the  drop  in  exports  in  countries  selling  raw 
materials  to  the  world  has  had  a  relatively  small  effect  on  their  output.  Their  demand  has 
dropped,  and  so  have  their  prices, but  they  have  not  experienced  the collapse  associated 
with postponing expenditures on goods of industrial origin. Although selling is tougher, export 
volumes  have  adjusted  less  than  the  world  average,  which  is  expected  to  fall  around  10 
percent this year, while the baseline scenario of our latest Monetary Policy Report foresees 
that the volume of Chilean exports will drop around 2 percent annually in the same period. 
This has been one of the factors explaining the milder impact of the crisis in Latin America. 
This  crisis  has  been  particularly  harsh  on  industrialized  economies,  which  have  seen  a 
steeper  fall  in  demand  for  their  products  due  to  the  great  fall  in  demand  for  durable  and 
investment goods (Figure 13). 
Final remarks 
Expansionary  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  policies  can  help  boost  economic  activity  when 
facing a deep drop in demand. However, their effects on confidence are not obvious. Thus, it 
is essential for measures taken to be sustainable and credible. If they lack credibility, their 
expansionary effect will be constrained by lack of confidence. Furthermore, it is conceivable 
that  in  the  presence  of  deep  macroeconomic  weakness  expansionary  policies  might 
exacerbate  the  loss  of  confidence.  This  explains  why  many  countries  need  to  raise  their 
interest rates and make fiscal adjustments in the midst of an economic crisis, because their 
economic  policies  and  financial  systems  lack  credibility.  This  is  obviously  not  the  case  in 
Chile  today.  In  our  country,  the  extraordinary  fiscal  and  monetary  stimulus  should  be  very 
effective, because these efforts are sustainable and credible. This is visible also, to different 
degrees, in other economies in the region that are committed to foreign exchange flexibility, 
price stability, fiscal responsibility and financial soundness. Developed economies will need 
to correctly address the medium-term effects of monetary expansions and increased public 
debt. 
If the origin of the global loss of confidence is the financial crisis, then stabilizing the banking 
industry and restoring the payment system is not only a priority but a necessary condition for 
economic  recovery.  Hence  the  importance  that  developed  countries  have  placed  on 
stabilizing the financial system, which is timidly beginning to bear fruit.  
No  simple  or  rapid  prescription  exists  to  rebuild  the  confidence  that  has  been  lost.  Some 
think that conveying optimism is a good idea. However, if such optimism has no ground, only 
a lack of sense of reality will be communicated. On the other hand, sending a pessimistic 
message can erode confidence even further. If there is one thing we know, not only about 
economics but about every walk of life, it is that people cannot be fooled forever, so the only 
way to act is realistically.

 BIS Review 76/2009
We are enduring a world recession, and nobody disagrees about the current hardships the 
world  economy  faces,  so  the  discussion  has  shifted  to  when  we  will  see  the  first  signs  of 
recovery.  The  scenario  of  global  economic  and  financial  catastrophe  has  dissipated,  and 
confidence seems to be recovering. One piece of evidence that the “free fall” of the world 
economy may have stopped is the evolution of growth projections for the year (Figure 14). 
After  the  sharp  deterioration  post-September  2008,  the  downward  revision  to  the  growth 
expected  for  this  year  has  moderated  in  magnitude  significantly  in  most  of  the  economic 
zones.  In  Japan,  which  has  suffered  one  of  the  most  intense  revisions  in  the  past  few 
months, the latest forecast revised upwards the expected growth for 2009. GDP growth for 
2010, which had posted small but systematic falls since September, is showing stability in 
the  latest  forecasts.  Combined  with  this,  perceptions  regarding  investors’  appetite  for  risk 
seem  to  be  picking  up.  Sovereign  premiums  have  declined,  capital  flows  to  emerging 
economies are returning, interest rates on Treasury bonds are increasing in many economies 
and the various expectations indicators are signaling some degree of recovered confidence. 
Extreme pessimism is withdrawing, but we cannot expect an accelerated recovery. 
The confidence crisis is one piece – an important one – of the explanation of the synchrony 
and strength of the shock that occurred at the end of last year. However, the distortions that 
motivated this confidence crisis will have persistent effects, even after the confidence is fully 
recovered. 
The loss of confidence explains the sharp and sudden downfall of the global economy, as 
well as its propagation to the other countries. However, the origin of the crisis is not this loss 
of confidence, but rather can be traced back to years of financial excesses that will take time 
to  resolve.6  The  big  and,  in  the  light  of  what  we  know  today,  unreasonable  private 
overborrowing in many developed countries will have to be corrected, leading to significant 
de-leveraging mostly of households. They will raise their saving rates which will hold back 
growth in consumption and demand. The countries that grew fast based on credit booms will 
have to adjust. We cannot expect the world economy to go back to pre-crisis growth rates. 
These  are  normal  stages  of  the  business  cycle,  but  the  magnitude  of  the  imbalances  that 
formed in those countries now experiencing financial crises indicate that their recovery will be 
slower.  This  is  why  when  the  downturn  of  the  economic  cycle  combines  with  a  financial 
crisis,  its  costs  are  magnified.  This  can  be  understood  and  even  quantified  by  using 
consumption theories, but that we will save for a future opportunity. 
Thank you very much.

If the crisis was caused only by a rise in uncertainty, a rapid recovery could be expected (Bloom, 2009), but 
the argument here is that imbalances exist that may hold back this recovery slowing it down.
