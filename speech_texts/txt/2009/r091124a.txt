Jean-Pierre Roth: Ten years’ experience in steering interest rates – 
taking stock of the Swiss National Bank’s monetary policy strategy 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the 
Swiss National Bank, at the University of Fribourg, Fribourg, 20 November 2009.  
The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 The  Swiss  National  Bank’s  monetary  policy  strategy  has  proved  successful  over  the  ten 
years since its introduction. Throughout this period, the SNB fulfilled its mandate of ensuring 
price  stability  while  taking  into  account  economic  developments.  The  inflation  forecasts, 
produced quarterly on the basis of various indicators, have proved especially useful. It has 
always  been  possible  to  successfully  manage  the  Libor  –  the  operational  objective  of  the 
SNB’s  monetary  policy  –  despite  an  international  environment  which,  at  times,  has  been 
extremely turbulent. The Libor was maintained within a range intended to provide the best-
possible conditions for a favourable development of the Swiss economy.
