José Dario Uribe: The Colombian monetary and exchange regime under 
stress 
Speech by Mr José Dario Uribe, Governor of the Central Bank of Colombia, at the Money 
and  Banking  Conference  “Lessons  and  Challenges  for  Emerging  Countries  during  the 
Crisis”, Central Bank of Argentina, Buenos Aires, 31 August 2009. 
 Let  me  first  thank  BCRA  for  organizing  this  very  interesting  seminar  and  for  inviting  us  to 
share  our  experience  in  these  turbulent  times.  The  mere  comparison  of  the  shocks  our 
economies  have  undergone  and  our  policy  reactions,  let  alone  the  insights  of  the 
distinguished  economists  who  join  us  in  this  timely  event,  is  of  great  value  for  our  future 
policy making. 
After  the  Lehman  Brothers  bankruptcy  in  September  2008,  the  Colombian  financial  and 
foreign exchange markets came under stress. However, the outcome of the shock was less 
severe  than  for  other  countries  in  the  region.  In  what  follows,  I  will  briefly  describe  the 
macroeconomic context in which the shock occurred, the effects of the shock and the policy 
response  by  Banco  de  la  Republica.  While  doing  so,  I  will  advance  some  reasons  for  the 
relatively  low  impact  of  the  shock on  Colombia.  Most  of  them  are  related  to  the prevailing 
regulatory framework. 
By  the  third  quarter  of  2008,  the  Colombian  economy  was  experiencing  a  deceleration  of 
growth. Consumption growth was weakening as a result of the previous tight monetary policy 
and the effect of the relative price increases of raw materials and foodstuffs on costs and real 
household income. Public investment fell drastically due to delays in public works programs. 
Nevertheless, according to our estimates, there still remained a positive output gap inherited 
from several years of strong aggregate demand growth.  
As  another  consequence  of  the  relative  price  shocks,  inflation  was  moving  well  above  its 
target range for the year (3.5%-4.5%). At the same time, inflation expectations started to rise 
which  threatened  to  permanently  unleash  inflation.  Hence,  policy  was  further  tightened  in 
July.  The  sharp  appreciation  of  the  currency  observed  in  the  first  half  of  the  year  was 
correcting itself possibly due to changing global risk perceptions and the daily purchases of 
fixed amounts of dollars by Banco de la Republica in the foreign exchange market. 
Immediately after the Lehman failure, the Colombian sovereign risk premium jumped around 
500 bps, an increase similar to the one which occurred in other countries (Charts 1 and 2). 
The currency moved along, depreciating by 15% between September 12th and October 29th. 
Again,  this  reaction  was  comparable  to  the  behavior  of  other  currencies  in  the  region. 
Domestic  public  bond  interest  rates  also  rose  after  the  shock  and  the  zero  coupon  curve 
became steeper as in other economies in the region (Charts 4 and 5). Thus, the heightened 
risk aversion after the shock produced the usual reaction on the foreign exchange and local 
bond markets.

However, the shock had more widespread consequences. As key markets in the U.S. were 
closed  (e.g.  the  short  term  commercial  paper  and  the  ABS  markets),  short  term  external 
funding for emerging markets was severely hampered. Those countries in which the financial 
system  depended  significantly  on  foreign  financing  suffered  stress  in  both  the  foreign 
exchange and the local short term lending markets as banks and other institutions scrambled 
to close their foreign currency liquidity gaps.  
However, this was not the case for Colombia, where regulation prevented local banks from 
being  exposed  to  maturity  mismatches  between  currency  and  foreign  currency.  It  also 
restricted  their  non-derivative  net  foreign  asset  position  to  be  positive  which  effectively 
inhibited the existence of a foreign currency interbank loan market.  
In other countries, pressures on the foreign exchange market and financial stability emerged 
from two things: the exposure of the corporate sector to currency risk and the realization of 
huge losses after the depreciation of the local currencies against the US dollar. Again, this 
was not the case of Colombia where capital controls and exchange rate volatility limited the 
corporate  sector’s  external  indebtedness.  At  the  same  time,  regulation  limited  the  gross 
foreign exchange derivative position of banks to five times their net worth or less. This was 
established to curb bank counterparty risk in a period in which there were large speculative 
and  arbitrage  positions  against  the  dollar  and  had  the  effect  of  restricting  the  currency 
exposure of the corporate sector. 
As a result, the impact of the Lehman shock on the Colombian foreign exchange and short 
term markets was smaller than it was in other countries. The Colombian peso depreciated 
less  than  other  currencies  in  the  region  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2008  (Chart  1)  while 
Banco de la República’s intervention in the foreign exchange market to support the currency 
was  far  lower  than  elsewhere  (Table  1).  The  interbank  overnight  interest  rates  remained 
close  to  the  policy  rate. The  spread  between  the  short term  deposit  interest  rates  and  the 
policy rate did not increase and financial system deposits continued to grow faster than GDP 
(Charts 6, 7 and 8).

 BIS Review 102/2009
Credit  growth  remained  strong  even  for  foreign-owned  banks  (Chart  9),  which  work  as 
subsidiaries  in  Colombia  and  are  subject  to  the  same  regulatory  framework  as  domestic 
banks.  However,  lending  interest  rate  spreads  did  rise  in  October  2008  thus  reflecting  a 
larger  risk  premium,  especially  for  prime  and  corporate  treasury  loans  (Chart  10).  Our 
financial system survey showed tightening local credit conditions in the fourth quarter (Chart 
11) and both firms and banks reported anecdotal evidence regarding more expensive credit 
with shorter maturities. Interestingly, throughout 2009 the behavior of foreign and domestic 
banks  in  the  local  loan  market  has  diverged.  Foreign  banks  have  drastically  cut  their 
exposure to consumer credit while domestic banks have kept high rates of growth of loans 
(Chart 9). 
At the same time the external credit lines available to the Colombian Banks were reduced 
and  their  cost  raised  (Chart  12).  Nonetheless,  the  use  of  those  lines  remained  below  the 
approved  amounts  and  declined  along  with  them  (Chart  13).  This  reflected,  among  other 
things, a dramatic fall in the demand for funding linked to international trade (Chart 14).

Meanwhile, the global economy slumped, terms of trade dropped and the external demand 
for  Colombian  products  slowed  down.  Consumer  and  business  confidence  indicators 
collapsed  thus  driving  domestic  spending  down.  Policy  makers  were  then  left  facing  the 
dilemma of high and increasing inflation on the one hand and a growing deterioration of both 
the  external  and  domestic  economic  outlook  on  the  other. Thus,  while  the  picture  became 
clearer, monetary authorities started to relax policy gradually. Capital controls were lifted in 
October and domestic reserve requirements were reduced in November. Liquidity provision 
was increased substantially as reflected by the negative and decreasing spread between the 
overnight interbank interest rate and the policy rate as the end of the year approached (Chart 
6).  Finally,  policy  rates  were  lowered  by  50  bps  in  December,  the  first  such  move  among 
emerging economies. A rapid sequence of cuts ensued, dropping the policy rate from 10% in 
November 2008 to 4.5% in June 2009. 
A  key  component  of  the  policy  reaction  was  the  flexibility  of  the  exchange  rate.  This  was 
possible  because  currency  mismatches  were  small  and  inflation  expectations  remained 
partially anchored despite the large shocks to the price of food, energy and raw materials. 
Exchange rate flexibility was fundamental in many senses. First, it enabled us to avoid the 
need  to  follow  the  pro-cyclical  monetary  policies  of  the  past.  Second,  it  worked  as  an 
absorber of the shocks hitting the current account of the balance of payments (terms of trade, 
export demand and workers’ remittances). And third, it prevented dollar demand pressures 
that liquidity-thirsty global financial institutions would have exerted under a peg regime.  
In summary, in the last quarter of 2008 our economies underwent a rapid transition from a 
supply  shock  situation  to  a  global  financial  crisis  and  a  world  recession.  My  take  from  the 
Colombian  experience  is  that,  as  a  regime,  the  inflation  targeting  framework  with  financial 
stability  complements  has  fared  well  and  done  the  best  possible  job  of  withstanding  the 
storm. This was mostly due to the fact that the financial stability measures taken before the 
crisis,  when  the  economy  was  booming,  enabled  us  to  avoid  large  mismatches  and  to 
moderate leverage. The results were: 
- 
The financial system was strong enough to absorb a large external shock and policy 
makers could focus on dealing with its macroeconomic consequences.

 BIS Review 102/2009
  The regime was flexible enough to accommodate a gradual path of disinflation under 
a preannounced path after the relative price shocks pushed inflation far above target. 
At the same time, this flexibility allowed the central bank to maintain the liquidity of the 
financial system in a period of stress. 
Our  challenge  ahead  consists  of  carefully  examining  our  financial  regulatory  framework  to 
shore up some aspects such as countercyclical provisioning and bank capital requirements. 
Simultaneously,  we  must  strive  to  enhance  financial  deepening  and  enlarge  the  set  of 
financial instruments available to Colombian firms and households. However, we must do so 
without significantly increasing systemic risk or depriving policymakers of the tools they need 
to face shocks. In such a task, difficult tradeoffs must be made, most importantly, perhaps, 
the  one  between  the  financial  integration  of  the  Colombian  economy  and  the  scope  for 
systemic risk and macroeconomic management.
