Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing 
and Economic Theory 
Speech at the University of Zurich in Switzerland 
Haruhiko Kuroda 
Governor of the Bank of Japan 
Introduction 
I am very honored to have the opportunity to give a speech at the University of Zurich today. 
I also would like to express my sincerest gratitude to the Swiss National Bank for arranging 
this valuable occasion. 
 At present, the Bank of Japan is pursuing powerful monetary easing under the framework of 
quantitative  and  qualitative  monetary  easing  (QQE),  with  a  view  to  achieving  the  price 
stability  target  of  2  percent.  In  my  speech  today  entitled  "Quantitative  and  Qualitative 
Monetary Easing and Economic Theory," I would like to talk about the following three points. 
First, I will outline Japan's experience with deflation, which lasted for 15 years and led the 
Bank to introduce the new policy framework of QQE. Second, I will explain in detail the two 
pillars of QQE -- the Bank's strong commitment policy and large-scale Japanese government 
bond (JGB) purchases -- both in terms of theory and practice. Lastly,  I will talk about the 
results  QQE  has  borne  to  date  as  well  as  remaining  challenges  bearing  in  mind  recent 
economic debates. 
 I. Japan's Experience with Deflation Leading Up to the Introduction of QQE 
A. Prolonged Deflation 
Let me start by talking about Japan's deflation, which lasted for 15 years. Japan experienced a 
major asset bubble from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. In the course of the burst of the 
asset  bubble,  Japan's  economy  suffered  a  sharp  slowdown  and  the  inflation  rate  steadily 
declined. In the late 1990s, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) 
fell into negative territory and, with brief exceptions, remained in negative territory  for 15 
years (Chart 1). 
 Economic  theory  points  to  two  possible  causes  of  the  prolonged  deflation.  The  first  is  a 
decline in the natural rate of interest, while the second is a decline in inflation expectations.1,2 
The natural rate of interest is the real interest rate that is neutral to economic activity in that it

will neither accelerate nor decelerate the economy. Although the determinants of the natural 
rate of interest are the subject of considerable debate among academics, it is widely thought 
that the potential growth rate of the economy plays a major role. Since the nominal policy 
interest  rate  has  a  lower  bound  of  0  percent,  if  the  potential  growth  rate  or  inflation 
expectations decline, real interest rates remain high compared with the natural rate of interest 
and  financial  conditions  cannot  be  sufficiently  accommodative.3 As  a  result,  it  becomes 
difficult to overcome deflation. 
 During  the  deflationary  phase  in  Japan,  both  the  natural  rate  of  interest  and  inflation 
expectations seem to have declined. While coping with the aftermath of the burst of the asset 
bubble, many economic entities such as firms and financial institutions were slow to respond 
to  drastic  changes  in  the  economic  environment  such  as  globalization  and  advances  in 
information technology. Against this background, Japan's potential growth rate declined from 
around 4 percent in the early 1990s to around 1 percent in the late 1990s. The decline in the 
potential growth rate continued in the  2000s, reflecting the aging of the population, which 
was progressing at a faster pace than in other major economies (Chart 2). Meanwhile, with 
actual inflation being slightly negative, inflation expectations also seem to have followed a 
downward trend. 
 B. Limited Room for a Policy Response 
With the aim of addressing the prolonged deflation, the Bank of Japan in 1999 introduced the 
zero  interest  rate  policy,  in  which  the  uncollateralized  overnight  call  rate  was  guided  to 
virtually 0 percent. Then, in 2001, the Bank introduced quantitative easing (QE), increasing 
monetary base to financial markets. These were path-breaking policy steps at the time, but 
Japan's economy nevertheless could not overcome deflation. 
 In 2008, with conventional monetary policy  measures already exhausted, Japan's economy 
was dealt a major blow by the global financial crisis. At the time, with the short-term policy 
                                                 
3 With the introduction of negative interest rate policies, the zero lower bound no longer has a literal 
meaning; however, given for example the presence of banknotes, which for the central bank represent 
liabilities with no interest, there is a certain limit to the extent to which nominal policy interest rates 
can be lowered.

interest rate at 0.5 percent, there was little room for further reductions. The situation was quite 
different  from  that  in  Europe  and  the  United  States,  where  there  was  room  for  a  further 
reduction by 3 to 4 percentage points. With inflation expectations low and little room for a 
further  reduction  in  nominal  interest  rates,  the  Bank's  ability  to  respond  was  limited.  This 
limited scope for a policy response is one of the major reasons why the economic downturn in 
Japan  was  more  pronounced  than  that  in  Europe  and  the  United  States  --  which  were  the 
epicenter of the crisis -- even though the soundness of financial institutions and the financial 
system in Japan remained unaffected (Chart 3). 
 In order to overcome deflation, real interest rates need to be well below the natural rate of 
interest, whose key determinant is the potential growth rate. Since monetary policy cannot 
raise the potential growth rate directly, the only means that central banks have left at their 
disposal is to substantially reduce real interest rates. Two key challenges to achieve this are to 
substantially lower nominal interest rates and to raise inflation expectations. 
 II. Theory and Practice of QQE 
The two challenges cannot be resolved using  conventional monetary policy relying on the 
control  of  short-term interest  rates.  While  policy  innovations  were  needed,  what  we  could 
rely on were established economic theories. The challenge for the Bank  of Japan therefore 
was to come up with concrete policy measures -- derived from economy theory -- that could 
be implemented in practice. The answer that the Bank came up with was QQE. This policy 
framework consists of two pillars: a strong commitment policy aiming to work on inflation 
expectations, and large-scale JGB purchases in order to push down long-term interest rates.  
 A. A Strong Commitment Policy (Forward Guidance) 
Let me elaborate on the strong commitment policy first. In economic theory, efforts by the 
central bank to work on people's forecasts and expectations through commitments regarding 
the  future  course  of  monetary  policy  are  called  "forward  guidance."  The  importance  of 
working  on  expectations  was  recognized  by  economists  long  ago.  For  example,  Ralph 
George  Hawtrey,  a  British  economist  active  in  the  first  half  of  the  20th  century,  and  John 
Richard Hicks, one of the leading economists of the 20th century, identified concepts such as 
"forward-looking  monetary  policy"  and  "announcement  effects."  These  concepts  were 
 3 
subsequently formalized by Friedman, Lucas, and the New Keynesians. Today, the idea that 
central banks can work on inflation expectations and increase the effectiveness of monetary 
policy by demonstrating their strong intention to achieve price stability forms a theoretical 
pillar  of  monetary  policy  in  many  countries,  and  is  widely  employed  in  policies  such  as 
inflation targeting.4 
 Recent years have also seen vigorous research on the mechanism that central banks -- even 
when  facing  the  zero  lower  bound  --  can  "borrow"  easing  effects  from  the  future  by 
committing  themselves  to  continuing  with  monetary  easing  even  if  economic  activity  and 
prices improve going forward. In 1998, Professor Krugman argued that, in order for Japan to 
overcome deflation, it was necessary to substantially increase the money supply and make 
real interest rates sufficiently negative by raising inflation expectations. In 2003,  Professor 
Woodford and Professor Eggertsson -- who was an IMF economist at the time -- argued that, 
in order to overcome deflation at the zero lower bound, the management of the expectations 
of private entities was important and that, for this purpose, a commitment to keeping future 
monetary policy sufficiently accommodative was indispensable.5 
 On the other hand, in the world of practice, the Bank of Japan has been a pioneer of such 
forward  guidance.  When  it  introduced  the  zero  interest  rate  policy  in  1999,  the  Bank 
explicitly  committed  to  continuing  with  the  zero  interest  rate  policy  "until  deflationary 
concern  is  dispelled."  I  regard  this  as  the  first  application  of  forward  guidance  in  practice 
worldwide.  Moreover,  in  the  period  of  QE  from  2001  to  2006,  the  Bank  committed  to 
continuing with QE "until the annual rate of change in the CPI registers zero percent or above 
in a stable manner." However, these policies were insufficient to overcome deflation. One of 
the reasons likely is that the natural rate of interest had declined more than expected, but it is 
probably also the case that the commitment at the time was somewhat ambiguous and the 
target  inflation  rate  was  too  low,  so  that  the  policies  were  insufficient  to  raise  inflation 
expectations.

Monetary Policy," Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 1 (2003): 139-211.

When it introduced QQE in 2013, the Bank -- in order to properly lift inflation expectations, 
and keeping latest economic theory  fully in mind  -- made sure to make a strong and clear 
commitment that it would achieve the 2 percent price stability target in a responsible manner. 
In addition, in September 2016, the Bank introduced its inflation-overshooting commitment, 
which  is  even  more  powerful  forward  guidance.  This  is  a  commitment  that  the  Bank  will 
continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed 
CPI exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. In general, it takes a fair 
amount  of  time  for  monetary  policy  to  affect  economic  activity  and  prices,  so  that  it  is 
desirable  to  take  monetary  policy  decisions  well  in  advance  based  on  the  outlook  for  the 
future. From this perspective, the current commitment, which clearly states that the policy 
will be maintained until the inflation target is achieved, is an exceptional step for a central 
bank and can be regarded as a more powerful measure. 
 B. Large-Scale JGB Purchases 
Next,  I  would  like  to talk  about  the  second  pillar  of  QQE:  the  large-scale  JGB  purchases. 
Since the global financial crisis, in order to overcome the zero lower bound, many central 
banks have pursued a decline in real interest rates by implementing monetary policy focusing 
on the longer end, where room for interest rate reductions remained. The most direct method 
to do this was to lower long-term interest rates through longer-term lending and purchases of 
long-term government bonds by central banks. 
 However, from the perspective of economic theory, opinions were split as to whether central 
banks can push down longer-term interest rates, with one view holding that this is possible 
and the other that it is not. Keynes and, following in his footsteps, Tobin, assuming imperfect 
financial  asset  substitution,  argued  that  long-term  government  bond  purchases  by  central 
banks will push down long-term interest rates,  and this was the  mainstream view until the 
1960s. However, as financial markets highly developed and Keynesian influence waned, and 
based  on  the  assumption  that  arbitrage  in  financial  markets  works  perfectly,  the  so-called 
 5 
"Wallace neutrality," holding that asset purchase operations by central banks have a neutral 
effect on asset price formation, gained traction.6 
While economic theory provided these two conflicting views, central banks -- tasked with the 
conduct of monetary policy -- weighed up the options, taking the limitations and problems 
suggested  by  theory  into  account,  and  devised  new  policy  schemes.  In  practice,  since  the 
global  financial  crisis,  major  central  banks  including  the  Federal  Reserve  have  conducted 
large-scale  government  bond  purchases  and  have  succeeded  in  pushing  down  longer-term 
interest rates. Recent empirical studies also  support the view that central bank government 
bond purchases can significantly push down long-term interest rates.7 Work on the theoretical 
underpinnings of these observations is still ongoing,  but research has been conducted once 
again  on  market  imperfections  and  segmentation,  focusing  on  deep-seated  demand  for 
government bonds as collateral and some investors' particular preference for investment in 
long-term government bonds. 
 The Bank of Japan has also purchased government bonds, and on a scale that far exceeds that 
of major central banks. The size of the Bank of Japan's balance sheet currently is about 500 
trillion  yen,  which  is  roughly  equivalent  to  Japan's  nominal  GDP.  Given  that  the  balance 
sheets of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) are equivalent to about 
20 to 40 percent of nominal GDP, I think this demonstrates how massive the Bank of Japan's 
purchases of government bonds are (Chart 4). The concrete approach of such purchases has 
also evolved over the past four and a half years. Initially, in order to  push down the entire 
yield curve, the Bank set the quantity target of government bonds to be purchased in a year. 
This approach has been widely used not only by the Bank of Japan but also by other major 
central  banks,  because  it  is  simple  to  operate  in  practice.  However,  a  problem  with  this 
approach  is  that  the  extent  to  which  long-term  interest  rates  fall  for  a  given  amount  of 
government  bond  purchases  depends  on  the  economic  and  price  situation  as  well  as

developments  in  financial  markets.  It  is  therefore  possible  that interest  rates  could  decline 
insufficiently to achieve the desirable yield curve or, conversely, could fall too much.  
 In order to solve this problem, the Bank of Japan in September 2016 introduced yield curve 
control  targeting  the  yield  on  10-year  JGBs.  Due  to  the  large-scale  JGB  purchases  over 
several  years,  the  Bank  has  a  considerable  presence  in  the  JGB  market,  so  that  it  has 
corresponding control over long-term interest rates. In addition, as a more fine-tuned means 
of adjusting interest rates, the Bank decided to  introduce a powerful tool called "fixed-rate 
purchase  operations,"  in  which  the  Bank  buys  unlimited  amounts  of  JGBs  at  a  specific 
interest rate level. In fact, for the past year, the Bank has been able to control 10-year JGB 
yields at the target level, and the yield curve has been formed smoothly in a manner consistent 
with the guideline for market operations. 
 III. QQE: Results to Date and Remaining Challenges 
This powerful monetary easing under QQE has been producing remarkable effects. Through 
a rise in inflation expectations and a substantial decline in longer-term interest rates, the Bank 
has succeeded in reducing real interest rates to levels well below the natural rate of interest for 
the first time in its two-decade-long battle with the zero lower bound on the short-term policy 
interest rate (Chart 5). Against this background, the output gap has improved steadily, and 
corporate profits have marked record highs. The labor market is very tight, at virtually full 
employment  (Chart  6).  On  the  price  front,  annual  CPI  inflation  excluding  fresh  food  and 
energy has been positive as a trend for about four years. This is the first time since the end of 
the 1990s that such positive developments are being observed in Japan. We judge that the 
economy is no longer in deflation, which is generally defined as a sustained decline in prices. 
 These developments indicate that Japan's economy has been improving steadily. At the same 
time, however, annual CPI inflation excluding fresh food has remained in the range of 0.5-1.0 
percent. Moreover, while inflation expectations had risen at one point, they have remained in 
a weakening phase, mainly reflecting the decline in actual inflation resulting from the fall in 
crude  oil  prices.  As  a  result  of  15  years  of  deflation,  a  deflationary  mindset  --  that  is,  the 
perception that prices will not increase easily -- has become deeply entrenched among firms 
and consumers, and there is still a long way to go before the price stability target of 2 percent 
 7 
is achieved (Chart 7). Therefore, in the last part of my speech, I would like to touch on the 
challenges  that  have  emerged  during  the  course  of  the  conduct  of  QQE,  bearing  in  mind 
recent developments in economic theory. 
 A. Dispelling the Deflationary Mindset 
The  first  challenge  is  how  to  dispel  the  deflationary  mindset  that  has  become  entrenched 
among people. The Bank's experience in this regard allows two observations. 
 The  first  is  that  central  banks  can  work  on  inflation  expectations,  as  theory  implies.  This 
became apparent during the first year of QQE. Inflation expectations responded positively to 
the  Bank's  strong  and  clear  commitment  to  achieving  the  2  percent  inflation  target  and  its 
large-scale monetary easing policy to underpin this commitment; as a result, many indicators 
of inflation expectations showed clear increases in a relatively short period (Chart 8). 
 The second observation is that, even though the forward guidance provided by the Bank of 
Japan  has  been  much  more  forceful  than  that  by  other  central  banks,  the  rise  in  inflation 
expectations  in  Japan  has  only  been  moderate.  The  phenomenon  that  economic  indicators 
such  as  inflation  expectations  seem  to  respond  more  moderately  to  central  bank  forward 
guidance than  theory  predicts  has  been labelled the "forward  guidance  puzzle,"  which  has 
also been the subject of academic debate.8 In Japan's case, analysis of recent developments 
shows  that  inflation  expectations  are  susceptible  to  "negative  price  shocks."9 When  actual 
inflation  decreased  from  summer  2014  due  mainly  to  the  substantial  decline  in  crude  oil 
prices,  inflation  expectations  --  which  had  been  increasing  steadily  until  then  --  were 
negatively  affected,  first  flattening  out  and  then  turning  weaker.  Especially  in  the  case  of

Japan,  where  inflation  expectations  are  not  anchored  at  the  inflation  target,  inflation 
expectation formation is largely adaptive in that it is greatly affected by past inflation rates. 
As  a  result,  inflation  expectations  do  not  respond  instantaneously  to  central  bank  forward 
guidance. 
 It is not easy to quickly dispel the deflationary mindset that has formed over the course of 15 
years of deflation. However, as the first observation I mentioned shows, in line with theory, 
the  Bank  can  work  on  inflation  expectations  through  forward  guidance,  if  it  can  avoid 
negative price shocks. Therefore, I think that the Bank's strong stance and persistent efforts 
toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent are important. 
 B. Determining the Optimal Yield Curve 
The second challenge that has emerged during the course of QQE is how to determine the 
optimal shape of the yield curve to achieve the 2 percent price stability target.  
 In the world of conventional monetary policy, many benchmarks to determine the desirable 
short-term interest rate level have been devised. For instance, the relative level of the natural 
rate  of  interest  and  real  short-term  interest  rates  is  important  for  assessing  the  degree  of 
monetary  easing,  while  the  Taylor  rule  is  an  attempt  to  directly  measure  the  desirable 
short-term policy interest rate. Under QQE, it is necessary to extend these approaches from 
short-term interest rates to the entire yield curve to establish new criteria for judgment. The 
Bank of Japan has started to work on both theoretical and empirical approaches to do so in the 
form  of  developing  the  concept  of,  and  measuring,  the  "natural  yield  curve."  Although 
research is still ongoing, we would like to continue to discuss the findings with academics and 
practitioners.10 
 Moreover, one point to consider when thinking about the optimal yield curve is that the effect 
of a decrease in interest rates varies depending on the maturity of interest rates in question. 
For instance, it is generally thought that reductions in short- to medium-term interest rates 
have the largest impact on economic activity and prices. The reason is that most corporate and

Measurement," Bank of Japan Working Paper Series, no. 15-E-5 (2015).

household  financing  is  based  on  short-  to  medium-term  interest  rates.  On  the  other  hand, 
longer-term interest rates are likely to be more relevant for society's financial infrastructure 
functions  such  as  insurance  and  pensions.  An  excessive  decline  in  long-term  and 
super-long-term interest rates may give rise to concerns about the rates of return on insurance 
and  pension  products,  which  may  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  economy  through  a 
deterioration  in  people's  sentiment.  Another  issue  that  has  recently  gained  attention  with 
regard  to the  impact  on  the  functioning  of  financial  intermediation  is the "reversal  rate."11 
This refers to the possibility that if the central bank lowers interest rates too far, the banking 
sector's  capital  constraint  tightens  through  the  decline  in  net  interest  margins,  impairing 
financial institutions' intermediation function, so that the effects of monetary easing on the 
economy reverses and becomes contractionary. In Japan's case, financial institutions have a 
solid  capital  base  and  credit  costs  have  fallen  sharply,  so  that  at  present  their  financial 
intermediation function is not impaired. However, because the impact of the low interest rate 
environment on financial institutions' soundness is cumulative, the Bank will continue to pay 
attention to this risk as well. 
 Trying to determine the optimal shape of the yield curve gives rise to various theoretical and 
practical issues. This requires using the full range of functions of a central bank, which can 
broadly monitor not only the economic and price situation, but also the situation in financial 
institutions and financial markets. Taking also various kinds of qualitative information into 
account, the Bank of Japan will continue to pursue the shape of the yield curve that is deemed 
most  appropriate  in  order  to  maintain  the  momentum  toward  the  2  percent  price  stability 
target. 
 Conclusion 
As  we  are  almost  running  out  of  time,  I  would  like  to  conclude  my  speech.  Since  its 
introduction in 2013, QQE has been called a "new phase of monetary easing" as it is more 
powerful than any previous policies. If the term "new phase" is used, however, in the sense 
that the Bank embarked on the monetary easing measures imprudently and recklessly without 
any consideration for theory, I would like to emphasize that that is not the case.

Needless to say, theory and practice are not opposites but complements that enhance each 
other. The famous expression "nothing is as practical as a good theory" applies to the theory 
and practice of monetary  policy as well.12 Central banks, as policy authorities,  need to put 
monetary policies into practice, but at the same time, these policies always have to be firmly 
supported by theory, since the effects and outcomes have a large impact on the economy and 
society.  For  example,  the  inflation-overshooting  commitment  is  more  powerful  than  any 
previous forward guidance and is unprecedented; yet, at the same time it is firmly grounded in 
economic theories regarding inflation expectation formation developed in recent years. On 
the other hand, because central banks confront a constantly changing world, in practice, they 
often  face  difficulties  that  cannot  be  explained  by  existing  theories.  When  the  Bank 
introduced  large-scale  JGB  purchases  and  yield  curve  control,  it  took  the  limitations  and 
issues  suggested  by  theory  into  account,  carefully  investigated  the  merits  and  demerits  of 
addressing those issues, and arrived at the current policy framework. I believe that such new 
steps in practice eventually will lead to new theoretical developments in the future. 
 Although there remain issues to be resolved to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, 
the environment surrounding prices in Japan has improved steadily compared to five years 
ago. I am convinced that this shows that the Bank's efforts based on the economic theories 
underpinning QQE have been going in the right direction. Going forward, with the output gap 
improving steadily, firms' stance is likely to gradually shift toward raising wages and prices. 
If further price rises come to be widespread, inflation expectations are likely to rise steadily. 
The Bank will continue to persist with powerful monetary easing to ensure that such positive 
developments are not cut short. 
 Thank you for your attention.
