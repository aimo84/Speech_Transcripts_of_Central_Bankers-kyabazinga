 FINANCE AND HOUSING IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE: 
 A DEMAND-SIDE APPROACH 
Liviu Voinea, Deputy Governor, National Bank of Romania 
 Finance and Housing Panel, Bruegel Annual Meetings 2017 
  In  2015,  ESRB  published  the  Report  on  residential  real  estate  and  financial 
stability  in  EU.  In  November  2016,  a  detailed  assessment  of  countries  with  high 
vulnerabilities followed.  
  AT,  BE,  DK,  FI,  LU,  NL,  SE,  UK  were  identified  as  having  medium  term 
vulnerabilities  on  the  Residential  Real  Estate  (RRE)  market. No  CEE  country  was 
singled out. 
  The ESRB methodology is based on the concept of “stretch”, applied to households, 
collateral, and banks. 
  Household  stretch  refers  to  vulnerabilities  related  to  borrowers’  indebtedness  and 
ability to repay debt, as well as their capacity to maintain their consumption pattern. 
Main  indicators:  household  debt  %  GDP,  financial  assets  to  debt,  debt  service  to 
income.  
  Collateral  stretch  refers  to  vulnerabilities  relating  to  the  property  market.  Main 
indicators: residential price index, house price to income.  
  Banking stretch refers to vulnerabilities related to direct losses by banks and due to 
their RRE exposures. Main indicators: loans for house purchases, loans’ growth rate 
and trend. 
  The report finds that the structural features of the RRE markets can be grouped into 
demand-side, supply-side and institutional factors. The demand side factors include: 
household  income,  credit  availability  and  interest  rates,  home  ownership  rates, 
demographic  factors.  On 
the  supply  side:  residential 
investment,  housing 
construction  and  construction  costs.  Institutional  factors:  housing  taxes  and 
subsidies, mortgage contract features, foreclosure and insolvency procedures.  
  However,  the  report  and  the  subsequent  analysis  are  restricted  in  the  definition  of 
structural features, in particular on the demand-side. 
1 
    Financial  stability  is  seen  in  the  narrow  sense  of  households  being  able  to  repay 
loans, and banks being exposed to the risk of non-performing loans, mainly because 
of  sharp  changes  in  the  house  prices.  Much  emphasis  is  put  on  the  flow  and  on 
trends, and little attention is being paid to the stock. 
  I  would  like  to  focus  on  these  structural  features  at  households’  level,  which 
eventually  influence  not  only  the  RRE  markets  but  also  pose  risks  to  financial 
stability in a broader sense. The discussion is particularly timely, as residential real 
estate  prices  have  resumed  an  upward  cycle  in  the  last  three  years  in  all  EU 
countries except Greece and Cyprus.  
  Ex-communist countries in CEE have high ownership rates (mostly as a result of a 
policy  in  the  early  90’s  to  sell  the  state’s  houses  at  affordable  prices  in  the  urban 
areas, as well as due to their large share of rural population). (Figure 1).  
  They  also  have  low  households  debt  to  GDP  ratios  and  low  household  mortgage 
debt to income ratio (Figure 2 and 3). However, these countries started from a very 
low debt level (practically zero), and they witnessed only one major boom and bust 
cycle of RRE prices in recent history. 
  These combined features seem to spare them of RRE vulnerabilities. But the devil is 
in details...meaning the structural features of households in CEE. 
  My point is that the analysis would benefit from having a broader perspective. We 
should  look  beyond  the  household  stretch to  household  strain, which  encompasses 
more structural factors. 
  I  would  refer  to  two  dimensions  of  the  household  strain:  quality  of  living  and 
inequality of income, savings, and access to credit.  
  1. Quality of living: 
-  overcrowding  –  CEE  countries  have  the  highest  concentration  of  dependent 
children, and the lowest number of rooms per person (Figure 4 and 5); 
-  poor  living  conditions  –  CEE  countries  have  the  largest  share  of  population 
living in poor conditions (Figure 6); 
-  high  risk  of  poverty  or  social  exclusion  (Figure  7)  –  despite  having  high 
ownership rates, CEE countries have high shares of people at risk of poverty or 
social exclusion (slightly declining after EU integration); 
2 
 -  To  partially  compensate  for  the  low  quality  of  living,  and  given  the  social 
pressure  of  a  high  ownership  rate,  property  taxes  are  relatively  low  in  CEE 
countries (Figure 8); 
-  Low  quality  of  living  creates  pressure  for  new  housing,  despite  financial 
difficulties to service new loans. It also creates pressure for migration, with long-
term implications for financial stability.  
  2. Inequality: 
 Income inequality: Romania, Bulgaria and Czech Republic have the highest Gini 
coefficient in the EU (Figure 9); 
-    Housing cost overburden: If we adjust for rent-related costs (as CEE countries 
have high ownership), many CEE countries are on top.  
Data on Romania: 
-  Housing  cost  overburden  is  very  high  for  the  first  quintile,  and  above  EU 
average for up to the fourth quintile (Figure 10); 
-  Savings behavior: there is a strong asymmetry in the deposits’ distribution (83% 
of  depositors  have  6.6%  of  total  deposits,  while  2.7%  depositors  have  60%  of 
total deposits) (Figure 11); 
-  Access  to  mortgages:  skewed  distribution  of  access  to  mortgages  (Figure  12); 
less than 1% of the 1st quintile, less than 2% of the 2nd and 3rd quintile. Even in 
the top quintile the access to mortgage is 12%. Aggravating factors: high share of 
mortgages  in  foreign  currency  (more  than  2/3  before  the  crisis)  and  at  variable 
rates (more than 90%); 
 Inequality  data  show  that  a  large  part  of  the  population  cannot  afford  to  buy  a 
new  house  in  the  absence  of  a  stock  of  savings  and  that  at  least  the  first  two 
quintiles of households struggle with the living costs in the houses they currently 
own; 
-  Because  of  the  lack  of  access  to  bank  finance,  some  low  to  middle  income 
households  resort  to  loans  from  non-bank  financial  institutions  (NBFI),  which 
have  very  high  interest  rates  on  very  short  maturities.  This  behavior  leads  to 
further exclusion from bank-related financial services, because of very high debt 
servicing costs for the NBFI loans. 
3 
 -  Inequality matters also for the transmission of monetary policy to the economy. 
For  example:  marginal  propensity  to  consume,  which  determine  household 
responses to a change in interest rates, varies with income. Household access to 
banks or financial markets which is typically limited for low- income households 
defines who will be directly and indirectly affected by changes in interest rates, 
and  thus  who  will  react  more  strongly  to  monetary  policy  impulses.  More 
generally,  household  response  to  changes  in  monetary  conditions  depends  on 
each  household’s  income  and  indebtedness  profile;  that  is,  on  their  disposable 
income  profile.  All  these  variables  indicate  that  two  different  income 
distributions  can potentially  induce  many  different impacts on  the  economy  for 
the same monetary policy1. 
  Access  to  credit  has  improved  after  the  crisis,  mainly  due  to  lower  interest  rates 
(Figure  13),  income  growth  (in  particular  for  low-middle  income  households)  and 
the  introduction  of  a  state-guaranteed  “First  House”  program  (Figure  14)    (which 
mainly  compensated  for  the  lack  of  savings  by  allowing  for  a  very  low  advance 
payment). When  “First House” program  was changed to allow only local currency 
guarantees, the share of local currency mortgages skyrocketed (Figure 15), reducing 
the  vulnerability  of  foreign  exchange  evolution,  but  increasing  the  risk  of  a  future 
interest rate shock on low-middle income households.  
  National Bank of Romania introduced a series of macroprudential measures starting 
from  2004  (Figure  16).  Yet,  macroprudential  rules  put  in  place  to  foster  financial 
stability can affect households unequally. For example, relaxing or tightening access 
to  mortgages  through  caps  on  debt-to-value  ratios  may  affect  the  distribution  of 
household wealth. 
  Monetary and macroprudential policies alone cannot  address the imbalances in the 
RRE  markets.  Policies  are  needed  to  address  the  structural  strains  in  the  demand 
side (at household level), while structural reforms are still needed on the supply side 
as well.
