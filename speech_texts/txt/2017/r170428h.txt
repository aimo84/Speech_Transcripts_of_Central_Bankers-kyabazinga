   Macroeconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy in Turkey 
 Remarks by  
Murat Çetinkaya 
Governor 
Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey 
at 
J.P. Morgan Turkey Macro and Credit Conference 
London 
 9 February 2017 
    Dear Participants, 
My  speech  will  try  to  elaborate  on  the  recent  macroeconomic  outlook,  monetary 
policy framework and the coordinated policy actions to support the fundamentals of 
the Turkish economy.  
1. Macroeconomic Outlook
Turkish  economy  was  hit  by  concurrent  shocks  in  recent  years.  Geopolitical 
tensions,  global  shocks,  security  related  issues  and  a  failed  coup  attempt  have 
created significant policy challenges. Despite the intensity and size of the shocks in 
recent  years,  the  growth  rate  has  been  quite  robust  until  recently,  outpacing 
emerging market average by a large margin (Figure 1). The resilience of growth in 
recent years can be attributed to factors such as prudent macroprudential policies 
reducing  the  sensitivity  of  economic  activity  to  capital  flow  volatility,  dynamic 
domestic market, market flexibility of exports, and the fall in energy prices.

However, the growth has posted a marked slowdown in the third quarter of 2016, 
following  the  failed  coup  attempt.  GDP  has  contracted  year-on-year  terms for the 
first  time  since  the  global  financial  crisis.  The  weakness  in  economic  activity  was 
driven  by  a  sharp  fall  in  domestic  demand  and  the  sizeable  drop  in  tourism 
revenues (Figure 2).

One  important  question  was  whether  the  third  quarter  would  stay  as  a  temporary 
slump  or  more  slowdown  was  on  the  way.    Recent  indicators  suggest  that  the 
contraction in economic activity was short-lived. We observed a rebound in the final 
quarter  of  the  year  as  depicted  by  the  rapid  recovery  in  the  industrial  production 
(Figure 3). Some of the recovery can be attributed to corrections due to technical 
factors such as shifting holidays and associated changes in the number of working 
days.  Therefore,  looking  through  temporary  factors,  we  assess  that  economic 
activity has expanded at a moderate pace during the final quarter of 2016 (Figure 
4).  We  expect  that  the  recovery  will  continue  to  be  mild  and  gradual  throughout 
2017,  which  will  leave  the  output  gap  at  the  negative  territory.  Main  drivers  of 
growth this year will be public investment expenditures and exports.

On  the  external  side,  I  would  like  to  note  that  the  Turkish  economy  has  been 
undergoing  a  persistent  rebalancing  process  in  recent  years.  Current  account 
deficit  has  come  down  from  a  peak  of  9  percent  to  less  than  4  percent  recently 
(Figure 5). Although improvement was partly reversed after mid-2016 due to sharp 
 3
fall  in  tourism  revenues,  we  expect  the  deficit  to  continue  to  shrink  gradually 
throughout 2017.  Main drivers of the improvement in the current account balance 
will be the recovery in exports and the weaker imports due to real exchange rate.

We think that exports will be one of the main drivers of growth in 2017. The main 
contribution to exports is expected from the European demand. Turkish exports are 
highly sensitive to the demand from Europe which constitute more than half of our 
total  exports.  Latest  projections  suggest  that  EU  demand  will  continue  to  support 
Turkish exports in the forthcoming period (Figure 6). Moreover, recently improved 
relations  with  our  neighbors  have  also  started  contributing  to  the  export  growth 
again  after  a  long  stagnation  period.  Recently,  there  is  some  slight  recovery  in 
exports to our main major trading partners such as Iraq and Russia. The recovery 
process is expected to continue throughout 2017. Overall, we anticipate a sizeable 
contribution from exports to growth in 2017.

Another  factor  that  will  lead  to  an  improvement  in  exports  and  current  account 
balance  is  the  depreciation  of  the  Turkish  lira.  As  of  January,  the  real  effective 
exchange rate index has fallen to 88.2, which is the historically lowest level in the 
past 15 years (Figure 7). The most recent data show that export growth has been 
outpacing import growth and we expect this picture to become more evident during 
the first half of 2017.

Regarding  external  finance,  current  account  deficit  is  financed  predominantly  by 
FDI flows and long term borrowing (Figure 8). Most recently, we still see a sizeable 
contribution  from  FDI  and  long  term  borrowing  by  banks  and  non-financial 
corporates, whereas portfolio inflows have been relatively weak. The share of long 
term debt in total debt has been increasing steadily. The banks and firms are able 
to roll their debt comfortably, and the roll-over ratios are still above 100%.

Dear Participants, 
Now,  let  me  turn  to  inflation  developments.  In  the  past  few  months,  we  have 
observed a marked increase in the CPI inflation, while the core inflation indicators 
have shown a milder upward movement (Figure 9). The main driver of inflation in 
the most recent data  was unprocessed food prices, most of  which can largely  be 
attributed  to  adverse  weather  conditions.  Tax  hikes  and  the  exchange  rate  pass-
through  have  also  had  a  visible  impact  on  inflation  in  recent  months.  The  rise  in 
core inflation was relatively subdued, despite the sharp exchange rate depreciation. 
Although  recently  observed  pass-through  seems  lower  than  historical  estimates 
due  to  subdued  demand  conditions,  exchange  rate  movements  still  pose  upside 
pressures on inflation.

 Going ahead, the lagged pass-through impact and the base effects resulting from 
previous year’s food price volatility will continue to weigh on inflation. On the other 
hand,  the  impact  of  tax  adjustments  on  CPI  inflation  is  likely  to  fade  away 
throughout 2017, given the government’s clear statement of no additional tax hikes 
in 2017 (Figure 10).

Our recent Inflation Report provides the updated inflation and output gap forecasts. 
We  have  revised  the  output  gap  on  the  downside,  whereas  short-term  inflation 
projections have been revised upwards. Disinflationary impact of weaker economic 
activity was more than offset by the exchange rate pass-through effect for the near 
term  forecasts.  Inflation  is  expected  to  further  edge  up  in  the  short  term  before 
gradually  coming  down  to  8  percent  at  the  end  of  the  year  (Figure  11).  Tighter 
monetary  policy  along  with  more  coordinated  fiscal  policy  conduct  should  contain 
the  second  round  effects  of  the  cost-push  developments.  Accordingly,  we  see 
inflation at 6 percent at the end of 2018 as the pass-through effect diminishes over 
time.

 2. Monetary Policy  
Dear Participants, 
I  will  devote  the  final  section  of  my  speech  to  the  policy  response  to  recent 
developments.  The main  focus  will  be  on  the  CBRT  policies,  but  at  the  end  I  will 
also try to  elaborate  briefly on  how the other policies on the macroprudential and 
fiscal side are coordinated to address the associated trade-offs. 
Central Bank of Turkey has taken a series of steps in 2016 to simplify the monetary 
policy framework. The intention was to gradually withdraw from the multiple policy 
rate  setup  in  order  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  monetary  policy  and  enhance 
policy predictability. We were able to stick to our plan until the end of the year, even 
after the currency pressures increased after the US elections. In fact, our interest 
rate hike in November was the first conventional interest rate response since 2008.

However, the situation  in early January necessitated an alternative approach. We 
have witnessed price movements in the FX market which could not be justified by

detrimental 
this 
unprecedented episode had to be swift, strong, and targeted. Given the significant 
downside  risks  to  the  economic  activity  and  the  credit  supply,  we  decided  to 
implement a monetary tightening which would strongly address the direct cause of 
the problem, with less significant implications on the real side of the economy. To 
this end, we have tightened the liquidity supply and induced a sharp increase in the 
short  term  interest  rates  at  the  interbank  market.  Moreover,  to  further  strengthen 
our control on the short-end of the yield curve, we have devised a new tool which is 
practically equivalent to a currency swap. This facility not only sets a benchmark for 
the price formation in the FX market but also supplies temporary FX liquidity to the 
market when needed. 
At  our  January  MPC  meeting,  we  have  increased  the  overnight  repo  and  late 
liquidity  window  rates,  delivering  a  strong  monetary  tightening  in  order  to  contain 
the  deterioration  in  the  inflation  outlook.  The  MPC  statement  underlined  that  the 
CBRT  will continue to  use all  available instruments in pursuit of the price stability 
objective.  
 8
We have also stated that inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors 
affecting  inflation  will  be  closely  monitored  and,  if  needed,  further  monetary 
tightening  will  be  delivered.  Moreover,  the  statement  signaled  that  necessary 
liquidity measures will be taken in case of unfounded pricing behavior in the foreign 
exchange market that cannot be justified by economic fundamentals.     
The figure depicts the two main interest rates  that matters most for the monetary 
transmission  mechanism  (Figure  12).  The  first  one  is  the  cost  of  central  bank 
funding (shown by the red line), which recently has increased by 200 basis points 
to around 10.3 percent. The second one is the interbank rate (orange line), which 
has  sharply  moved  up  and  have  been  consistently  close  to  11  percent  since  our 
latest MPC meeting. These two rates clearly indicate that monetary policy has been 
tightened to a great extent.

 I  would  like  to  underline  that  the  recent  policy  we  have  been  implementing  is  not 
equivalent  to  the  previous  discretionary  monetary  policy  under  a  flexible  corridor 
framework where the policy stance shifted at daily and weekly frequencies. This is 
a  clear  and  stable  policy  tightening  which  will  be  preserved  until  we  see  a 
considerable improvement in medium term inflation dynamics. 
The  significant  tightening  in  the  monetary  policy  stance  can  also  be  observed 
directly by looking at the yield curves. The left side figure shown below compares 
the most recent yield curve with the one materialized in early January, right before 
the CBRT response (Figure 13). It is clear that the short-end has shifted up and the 
longer-end  has  fallen,  which  is  a  typical  response  after  a  credible  monetary 
tightening.  As  another  indicator  of  the monetary  tightening  in  time  dimension,  the 
 
9
right  side  figure  below  shows  the  evolution  of  the  slope  of  the  yield  curve  at  the 
cross  currency  swap  market,  which  also  clearly  reveals  a  flattening  in  the  yield 
curve (Figure 14).

Were these policies effective? More time is needed to assess the ultimate impact, 
but the initial response is encouraging. Turkish lira, which has depreciated relative 
to  peer  currencies  in  the  second  half  of  2016,  has  stabilized  after  the  policy 
tightening, partly containing the upside risks on the inflation outlook (Figure 15).

 The policy we adopted has been also effective on the volatility indicators. The last 
figure I would like to show you pertains to the volatility in the FX market (Figure 16). 
As you can see, the implied volatility of Turkish lira has moved up sharply in early-
January,  but  eased  significantly  after  the  implementation  of  the  recent  CBRT 
measures.

Dear Participants, 
Let me wrap up my speech by highlighting the value  of close policy  coordination. 
Turkey has faced a series of significant shocks in the past years. Most recently, the 
slowdown in the economic activity, tightening in financial conditions, sharp currency 
depreciation,  and  rising  inflation  have  necessitated  a  coordinated  action  by  all 
relevant authorities. 
Central  Bank  has  mainly  focused  on  inflation  and  FX  developments  during  this 
period.  We  used  our  rich  toolkit  to  tighten  monetary  policy,  but  at  the  same  time 
provided  liquidity  support  to  FX  market  through  reserve  requirements  and  other 
tools.  
As  part  of  the  coordinated  policy  mix,  other  authorities  have  taken  a  series  of 
measures to support the credit channel and economic activity. In order to stimulate 
the  loan  supply  and  demand,  the  bank  regulation  authority  has  released  some  of 
the  buffers  accumulated  in  recent  years,  including  the  maturity  restrictions  and 
loan-loss  provisions.  The  government  has  announced  a  stimulus  package  to 
contain  a  possible  adverse  feedback  loop  between  economic  activity  and  loan 
supply.  To  this  end,  collateral  conditions  were  eased  for  corporates,  several 
incentives  were  provided  to  stimulate  investments  and  exports,  direct  support  for 
SME  loans  were  provided  through  government  guarantee  schemes  and  loan 
restructuring  processes.  Most  recently,  tax  cuts  have  been  introduced  for  certain 
durable  products  to  support  demand  and  production  without  generating  inflation.

Moreover, as a reflection of the enhanced fiscal-monetary policy coordination, the 
finance ministry announced clearly that no tax hikes are envisaged in 2017. 
We  anticipate  that  these  concerted  efforts  will  not  only  bring  inflation  gradually 
towards  our  medium  term  target  of  5  percent  but  also  support  the  economic 
recovery in the forthcoming period.  
Thank you for your attention.
