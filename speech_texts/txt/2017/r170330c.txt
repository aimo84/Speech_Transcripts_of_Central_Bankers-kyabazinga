 Lessons of Japan: Focusing on Issues regarding 
Long-Term Inflation Expectations 
Speech at Yale University in New Haven 
Takehiro Sato 
Member of the Policy Board 
Introduction 
First  of  all,  I  thank  Senior  Fellow  Stephen Roach  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  talk to 
this esteemed audience at Yale. I  understand that he teaches macroeconomic policy issues, 
focusing on the lessons Japan learned from deflation. The Bank of Japan is the frontrunner 
in  combating  deflation.  As  one  of  its  board  members,  I  hope  that  my  remarks  today  will 
help stimulate academic discussion. 
 Deflation has prevailed for almost a quarter century in Japan. To overcome deflation, theory 
and practice were introduced and tested, and the policy effects were examined. As a result, a 
range  of  knowledge  and  wisdom  has  been  acquired.  The  Bank,  on  its  part,  conducted  a 
comprehensive  assessment  of  quantitative  and  qualitative  monetary  easing  --  or  QQE  for 
short  --  in  September  last  year,  and  learned  some  important  lessons.  Among  these,  I  will 
today  focus  on  the  issues  regarding  long-term  inflation  expectations.  This  is  because  they 
are  the  key  factor  in  overcoming  deflation.  I  admit  that  conceiving  such  expectations  is  a 
somewhat elusive task, but it is worth discussing. 
 I. Lessons of Japan 
A. Determinants of Long-Term Inflation Expectations 
Japan's  experience  refutes  the  premise  for  monetary  policy  that  long-term  inflation 
expectations are determined by a central bank (Chart 1).1  This is because monetary policy 
effects  are  asymmetric  when  a  central  bank  decreases  long-term  inflation  expectations 
toward the target and when it raises them toward the target. 
 In  other  words,  once  long-term  inflation  expectations  --  the  norm  of  prices  --  are 
de-anchored, a central bank's ability to influence inflation is constrained significantly due to 
the  zero  interest  rate  bound.  Those  in  academia  might  feel  that  this  is  somewhat 
troublesome.  In  fact,  however,  when  a  central  bank  re-anchors  long-term  inflation 
                                                   
1  In its Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (adopted effective January 24, 
2012; as amended effective January 26, 2016), the Federal Reserve indicated that "The inflation rate 
over  the  longer  run  is primarily  determined  by  monetary  policy,  and  hence  the Committee  has  the 
ability  to  specify  a  longer-run  goal  for  inflation."  See  Board  of  Governors  of  the  Federal  Reserve 
System (2016).

expectations toward the target, there will be a limit if monetary policy is the only game in 
town. What is needed, in addition to continued powerful monetary easing, is a raise in the 
potential  growth  rate,  which  roughly  equals  the  natural  rate  of  interest.  This  should  be 
achieved through structural policies including labor market reform.2 
 Academic discussion is seriously needed on this point. This is because Japan is not the only 
country that has learned lessons on deflation. Namely, simultaneous declines in the potential 
growth  rate  and  long-term  inflation  expectations  have  been  observed  in  many  countries 
since the latest global financial crisis (Chart 2). 
 B. Negative Effects of Excessively Low Long-Term Inflation Expectations 
Let  me  elaborate. The  more  fundamental  lesson  we  learned  was  that  central  banks  should 
not allow long-term inflation expectations to decline to excessively low levels. 
 Central  banks  can  lower  excessively  high  long-term  inflation  expectations  because  of  the 
credibility  they  have  earned  through  the  past  achievements.  The  fight  against  inflation  is 
easier  and  the  strategy  can  be  simpler  compared  with  combating  deflation.  There  is  a 
premise  for  economic  theory  that  holds  true  with  the  fight  against  inflation;  namely, 
long-term inflation expectations are determined by inflation targets set by central banks. 
 By contrast, an inflation target will not be the basis for an economic model when set by a 
central  bank  that  has  lost  credibility  due  to  excessively  low  inflation.  For  example,  the 
declines  in  the  potential  growth  rate  and  long-term  inflation  expectations  occurred 
simultaneously  in  Japan.  However,  the  academic  side  of  economics  has  yet  to  provide  an 
answer as to whether it is possible to raise excessively low long-term inflation expectations 
through monetary policy. This is because of the present unique situation in Japan -- as I will 
touch  on  later  --  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  are  at  virtually  0  percent  and  the 
potential  growth  rate  is  at  slightly  above  0  percent,  while  there  is  a  zero  nominal  interest 
rate bound to usual economic transactions. 
                                                    
2  The original "three-arrows" strategy of the Abe administration had a positive implication that fiscal 
and monetary policies combined would support structural policies. 
2 
In reality, even under a large-scale unconventional monetary policy, both the mechanism of 
Friedman's  quantity  theory  of  money  and  the  New  Keynesian  model  of  a  jump  in 
expectations have operated insufficiently so far. In terms of re-anchoring long-term inflation 
expectations,  the  glass  is  both  half  full  and  half  empty.  If  the  potential  growth  rate  and 
long-term inflation expectations had not declined to the current low levels, monetary policy 
would have been more effective. 
 Next,  I  will  discuss  long-term  inflation  expectations  in  the  following  aspects:  (1)  their 
formation  mechanism;  (2)  reasons  for  low  expectations  in  Japan;  (3)  the  relationship  with 
Japan's financial crisis; and (4) the relationship with labor market reform. 
 II. Issues regarding Long-Term Inflation Expectations 
A. Formation Mechanism 
In economics theory, long-term inflation expectations are irrelevant to the potential growth 
rate. However, I doubt that this holds true in reality, in light of what is happening in Japan. 
Rather, I think that long-term inflation expectations and the potential growth rate do have a 
correlation, although it may not be strong (Chart 3). 
 Long-term  inflation  expectations  declined  sharply  in  Japan,  before  and  after  the  financial 
crisis  in  the  late  1990s.  Economic  fundamentals  already  had  been  weak  before  the  crisis 
because of the negative interaction between demand and supply conditions; specifically, (1) 
a negative financial accelerator on the demand side due to the dire asset price deflation, and 
(2)  the  impairment  of  the  financial  intermediary  function,  as  well  as  the  distortion  of 
economic  resource  allocation  caused  by  the  bubble  economy  on  the  supply  side.  The 
financial  crisis  triggered  further  weakening  of  economic  fundamentals  (Chart  4).  In  this 
situation, pessimism about the future led to a decline in people's expectations for medium- 
to long-term growth, and the potential growth rate remained low over a long period of time. 
As a result, people's perception of prices became excessively conservative. In other words, 
long-term inflation expectations turned downward. 
 3 
B. Reasons for Low Expectations in Japan 
Next,  let  us  take  a  look  at  developments  in  survey-based  measures  of  expected  long-term 
inflation  in  Japan.  A  survey-based  rate  marked  a  sharp  decline  during  the  period  of  the 
financial crisis in the late 1990s, and then leveled out at around 1 percent. Since then, even 
throughout the period of the global financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis, it 
has been more or less unchanged at around 1 percent (Chart  5). However, I am somewhat 
doubtful  about  this  figure.3  I  believe  that  it  is  more  persuasive  to  say  that  long-term 
inflation expectations in Japan have actually declined to around 0 percent, for the following 
four reasons.4 
 First, the frequency of micro-level price changes suggests that the mode value remains zero. 
In other words, the year-on-year rate of increase in the prices of sample items concentrated 
on  0  percent.  Therefore,  people  are  likely  to  consider  that  zero  inflation  is  a  steady  and 
constant state. It is helpful to see the comparison with the U.S. situation (Chart 6).5 
 Second,  administered  prices  are  excessively  sticky  (Chart  7).6,7  For  example,  the  starting 
subway fare in Tokyo has been unchanged for over 20 years since 1995 -- disregarding the 
effects of the consumption tax hikes. 
                                                    
3  Market-based  measures  of  long-term  inflation  expectations  --  such  as  the  5-year,  5-year  forward 
inflation swap rate -- have less credibility than survey-based ones in Japan, due to a lack of market 
liquidity and depth, and therefore do not represent a useful reference. 
4  On this point, it seems intuitively unlikely that many of the surveyed economists project that the 
inflation rate will remain at about 0 percent over the next 5-10 years. On the other hand, there might 
be a disparity between the perception of prices of economists and that of households and firms, i.e., 
long-term inflation expectations of households and firms might be lower than those of economists. 
5  See Watanabe and Watanabe (2016). 
6  In reality, amid the prolonged economic stagnation in Japan, a mechanism was established firmly 
in which the rise in costs for administered prices was compensated for by fiscal deficits reflecting the 
increasing political pressure to avoid the rise in administered prices. Such a process itself suggests a 
decline in long-term inflation expectations, which is the norm of prices. 
7  See Shintani, Kurachi, and Nishioka (2016). 
4 
Third, the rate of increase in wages resulting from the wage negotiations between labor and 
management continued to be 0 percent for a long time. Even after the recent resumption of 
base pay increases, the rate is less than 1 percent (Chart 8).8 
 Fourth, Japan's deflation equilibrium cannot be theoretically explained on the basis of the 1 
percent long-term inflation expectations (Chart 9). 
I will elaborate on the fourth point. Let us assume that there is a zero nominal interest rate 
bound. Even if that is the case, as long as long-term inflation expectations are meaningfully 
positive, the real interest rate will fall below  the natural rate of interest, which is around 0 
percent,  by  making  the  real  interest  rate  negative.  In  this  case, monetary  policy  should  be 
effective,  and  Japan's  economy  should  be  able  to  get  out  of  deflation  equilibrium.  This 
suggests  that,  if  long-term  inflation  expectations  are  at  least  around  1  percent,  monetary 
policy can be more effective. 
 C. Relationship with Japan's Financial Crisis 
Looking  back,  if  Japan's  financial  crisis  in  the  late  1990s  had  been  settled  more  promptly 
with ample liquidity provision and capital injection, the large-scale credit crunch could have 
been avoided, and thus the subsequent path of Japan's economy might have been different. 
This  widely  shared  lesson  was  put  to  good  use  at  the  time  of  the  global  financial  crisis 
afterwards.  I  note  that  it  is  important  to  address  the  private  sector's  solvency  problem 
through provision of a massive scale of liquidity and through credit enhancement by means 
of swift capital injection. 
 In  Japan,  the  bailout  of  financial  institutions  with  taxpayers'  money  experienced  a  strong 
backlash  from  the  public.  It  took  a  considerable amount  of  time  before  public  funds  were 
actually  injected  into  financial  institutions.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  financial  crisis,  the 
injection  of  public  funds  was  carried  out  several  times.  However,  it  actually  took  several 
years before concern about the stability of the financial system subsided (Chart 10). 
                                                    
8  It also can be said that the resumption of base pay increases under the Abe administration  might 
prove that long-term inflation expectations have started to rise from 0 percent. 
5 
It was only after the introduction of the zero interest rate policy in 1999 and the introduction 
of  quantitative  monetary  easing  in  2001  that  the  market's  liquidity  concern  was  alleviated 
through the Bank's provision of ample funds (Charts 11-1 and 11-2).9 
 Quantitative  monetary  easing  was  a  pioneering  attempt  in  increasing  the  predictability  of 
monetary  policy.  It  was  conducted  both  by  lowering  market  interest  rates  to  virtually  0 
percent  through  the  provision  of  ample  funds  surpassing  the  required  reserves  and  by 
introducing  forward  guidance.  Nevertheless,  I  have  a  feeling  that  the  Bank  could  have 
addressed  liquidity  concern  in  the  late  1990s  at  a  much  earlier  stage.  In  that  regard,  I 
somewhat  have  understanding  toward  the  criticism  that  the  Bank's  monetary  easing  was 
insufficient at that time, and as a result the financial crisis was prolonged and the economy 
fell into a deflationary trap.10 
 I  also  note  that  the  Bank  paid  particular  attention  to  the  negative  feedback  loop  between 
asset price deflation and the real economy. It did not pay due attention to mild deflation for 
a  long  period.  In  fact,  the  Bank  repeatedly  explained  that  the  deflation  was  mild  and  the 
economy  was  not  falling  into  a  deflationary  spiral,  unlike  at  the  time  of  the  Great 
Depression in the 1930s.11 
 It  is  true  that  the  Bank's  provision  of  ample  funds  and  the  government's  capital  injection 
helped  avoid  a  deflationary  spiral,  although  these  were  somewhat  delayed.  Long-term 
inflation expectations were declining, but not much attention was paid by the Bank or those 
in academia to their potential effects on monetary policy. 
                                                    
9  In  response  to  Japan's  financial  crisis  in  the  1990s,  the  Bank  expanded  its  balance  sheet  and 
conducted both funds-supplying and funds-absorbing operations -- i.e., it actively provided funds to 
money  markets and at the same time absorbed excess reserves by selling bills. However, this does 
not mean that the Bank provided excess reserves and allowed the decline in market interest rates to 0 
percent. After all, there was no such concept of quantitative easing at that time. 
10  Another significant lesson was that the excessive monetary easing before the financial crisis was 
the  source  of  the  huge  economic  bubble.  In  the United States  as  well,  large-scale  monetary  easing 
after the bursting of the IT bubble and subsequent moderate tightening at a measured pace became 
the source of the housing bubble, which led to the global financial crisis. 
11  See Bank of Japan (2006). 
6 
With hindsight, the Bank  at least  should have clarified its firm determination  not to allow 
the decline in long-term inflation expectations, as was done by the Federal Reserve after the 
global financial crisis and by the European Central Bank after the sovereign debt crisis. 
 D. Relationship with Labor Market Reform 
In  my  view,  as  a  measure  to  raise  long-term  inflation  expectations  that  already  have 
declined to a low level, it is important to have structural policies, particularly labor market 
reform. 
 If long-term inflation expectations have some kind of relevance to the potential growth rate, 
it  is  necessary  to  raise  both  at the  same  time. To  this  end,  one  important measure is  labor 
market  reform.  If  such  reform  leads  to  rises  in  labor  productivity  and  the  labor  force 
participation rate, the potential growth rate will increase from a longer-term perspective and 
firms'  expected  rates  of  return  and  households'  permanent  income  also  will  increase.  This 
will  strengthen  monetary  easing  effects  and  the  inflation  rate  will  increase.  Then,  the 
adaptive  formation  mechanism  of  inflation  expectations,  which  is  unique  to  Japan,  will 
bring about a positive influence on long-term inflation expectations. 
 In  Japan,  some  labor  market  practices  could  be  constraints  on  raising  long-term  inflation 
expectations. Therefore, labor market reform should be actively pursued. Given that there is 
an increasing sense of labor shortage caused by the population decline, now is an ideal time 
to  take  a  step  forward  in  labor  market  reform.  I  will  next  focus  on  three  possible  reform 
measures. 
 First, a more flexible adjustment mechanism should be implemented in Japan's labor market. 
Let me elaborate on this point. The way people form their expectations could be affected by 
how labor market adjustments are made during periods of recession -- i.e., whether to have 
quantity  adjustments  in  terms  of  headcount  or  price  adjustments  in  terms  of  wages.  For 
example,  in  the  U.S.  labor  market,  quantity  adjustments  are  mainly  made  in  the  form  of 
layoffs. Japan's labor market mostly makes price adjustments and layoffs tend to be avoided 
(Chart 12). 
 7 
Let  me  add a  few  things  about  wage adjustments  in  Japan.  In  the  face  of  the  past  shocks, 
including  oil  crises  during  early  1970s  and  1980s,  Japan's  labor  unions  had  a  practice  of 
prioritizing the job security of regular workers and accepting management's proposal to set 
lower  wages.  Under  such  coordination  between  labor  and  management,  restraining  wage 
increases of regular workers was effective in controlling inflation. Afterwards, the base pay 
of  regular  workers  significantly  shifted  downward  following  Japan's  financial  crisis,  and 
then  became  sticky  at  low  levels.  Since  then,  non-regular  workers  have  acted  as  a  buffer 
against wage adjustments as they are outside the protection of labor unions. 
 As  illustrated,  Japanese-style  employment  and  wage  practices  of  prioritizing  the  job 
security of regular workers and restraining wage increases may have influenced long-term 
inflation  expectations  to  shift  downward.  If  that  is  the  case,  the  solution  is  to  implement 
dynamic U.S.-style employment practices and allow the compensation of regular workers to 
reflect risk premiums. 
 I note that, in Japan's labor market, job mobility and a social safety net are not necessarily 
sufficient.  In  this  situation,  the  U.S.-style  employment  system  is  unlikely  to  be  socially 
acceptable. In fact, it has been difficult to reach a consensus between labor and management, 
and thus progress in labor market reform has been moderate. 
 I  believe that  a  key  to  success  in  labor  market  reform  is  to implement  dynamic  U.S.-style 
employment practices while modifying them to fit Japan's own circumstances. For example, 
it is important to gain the understanding of labor unions by establishing a social safety net 
that  leads  to  economic  growth.  One  option  is  to  build  a  framework  for  employment  and 
reemployment assistance in coordination with the government, labor, and management. 
 Second, a forward-looking wage negotiation system should be established. Let me elaborate 
on  this  point.  In  Japan's  wage  negotiations,  the  observed  rate  of  increase  in  the  consumer 
price  index  (CPI)  of  the  previous  year  is  used  as  a  benchmark  in  determining  the  rate  of 
increase in wages for the following year (Chart 13). For this reason, even when a decline in 
the  CPI  is  attributed  to  external  factors,  including  a  decline  in  crude  oil  prices,  the  low 
inflation rate tends to be referred to in wage negotiations. That said, such a price decline is a 
8 
positive  factor  in  corporate  profits  with  an  improvement  in  the  terms  of  trade  at  a 
macroeconomic level.12 
 In my view, it is necessary to replace the existing practice of referring to  the observed CPI 
in  the  past  and  negotiating  the  wage  increases  for  only  one  year  in  an  adaptive  manner. 
Instead, it is necessary to implement the practice of negotiating wage increases for several 
years in a forward-looking manner by sharing the outlook on the path of price changes over 
several years, or over the medium to long term.13 
 Third, there should be a change in the practice of applying the result of labor-management 
wage  negotiations  at  large  manufacturers  to  other  industries.  In  Japan,  the  result  of  wage 
negotiations  at  large  manufacturers  --  especially  automobile,  steel,  and  other  major 
manufacturers -- tends to be used as a benchmark for such negotiations  in other industries, 
including non-manufacturing. Therefore, even when the terms of trade at a macroeconomic 
level improve due to the yen's appreciation, if  a higher yen causes major manufacturers to 
have lower profits and depress the rate of wage increases, such a rate for non-manufacturers 
also tends to be depressed accordingly. 
 In Japan, the share of manufacturing in gross output is less than 20 percent. Therefore, it is 
not  suitable  at  this  time  to  use  wages  at  major  manufacturers  as  a  benchmark  for  wage 
negotiations in other industries. I believe that wage increases should reflect individual firms' 
profits with forward-looking inflation expectations being used as a basis. 
 III. Addendum: Recent Discussion on Fiscal Policy Measures 
The roles of fiscal policy measures have regained attention in Japan recently, following the 
insufficient  increase  in  expectations  even  with  the  large-scale  unconventional  monetary 
                                                   
12  The  Bank  has  conducted  a  quantitative  analysis  on  this  point.  See  Appendix  4,  Bank  of  Japan 
(2016). 
13  The Japanese government also recognizes the importance of forward-looking wage negotiations. 
At the Council for the Realization of Work Style Reform, Prime Minister Abe has asked the business 
community for wage increases that take inflation expectations into consideration.

policy. "Helicopter money" and the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level (FTPL) are examples 
of this (Chart 14). 
 The  issue  they  have  in  common  is  whether  or  not  additional  fiscal  expenditure  will  exert 
positive effects on the way people form their positive expectations in a sustainable manner. 
Households do not act as rationally as Ricardian equivalence assumes. Meanwhile, it also is 
plausible  to  assume  that  their  concerns  over  possible  tax  hikes  and  an  increase  in  social 
security tax burden provide a reason for their cautious outlook. These arguments might have 
given rise to the idea that it is desirable to have permanent fiscal policy expansion  without 
an accompanying future tax hike. 
 Even  if  government  debts  are  assumed  to  be  financed  in  the  future  through  inflation  that 
will be triggered by fiscal expansion, empirical research on related theoretical models is still 
insufficient. Therefore,  the  models  cannot  be applied  to  the  actual  policy  formulation,  nor 
used as the basis for macroeconomic forecast for such formulation. 
 Economic  policy  is  implemented  based  on  a  critical  decision  that  takes  account  of  more 
than  just  gains  and  losses  for  various  economic  entities.  This  is  because  it  is  difficult  to 
obtain  the  consent  of  stakeholders  based  on  an  economic  model  that  considers  future 
inflation to be inevitable but cannot predict when it will occur. Let me also note that actual 
policy  management  cannot  help  being  prudent.  The  reason  for  this  is  that  the  policy 
authorities have to strongly recognize various constraints. In fact, macroeconomic policy is 
managed  under  various  constraints  --  such  as  those  in  terms  of  legal,  accounting,  and 
practical affairs, as well as the need for parliamentary consent. 
 Concluding Remarks 
I will close by noting the lesson learned from the 4-year experience since the introduction of 
QQE.  Once  long-term  inflation  expectations  decline,  it  is  not  easy  to  raise  them,  even 
through the large-scale unconventional monetary policy. Given that monetary policy  on its 
own has limited effects, it is vital to make steady efforts, such as through the labor market 
reform  that  I  discussed  earlier,  in  order  to  change  conservative  inflation  expectations  that 
10 
are  deeply  rooted  in  people's  mindsets.  In  particular,  I  consider  it  important  to  produce  a 
change in the wage determination mechanism. 
 In the process of wage determination, it is desired that inflation targets set by central banks 
be the basis for the medium- to long-term path of inflation. For this purpose, central banks' 
inflation targets should gain sufficient credibility with the public. To this end, it is necessary 
to see achievements that prove monetary policy is able to change the inflation trend. It is not 
easy to regain credibility. As the frontrunner in combating deflation, however, the Bank of 
Japan will continue to endeavor to do so, always deliberating on what can be accomplished 
through monetary policy. 
 Thank you.

Notes: 1. The wage is the hourly wage. Figures for wages in Japan are calculated as "total cash earnings (establishment with 30 or more employees)" divided by 
"total hours worked." Those in the United States are "average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees: total private."
2. Rate of inflation for Japan is indicated in terms of the CPI for all items less fresh food and that for the United States is in terms of personal 
consumption expenditures excluding food and energy.
3. The CPI in Japan is adjusted to exclude the effects of the consumption tax hikes.
