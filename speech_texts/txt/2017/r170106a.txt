Introduction 
It  is  a  great  honor  to  have  this  opportunity  to  address  such  a  distinguished  gathering  of 
business leaders in Japan today. 
 
2017 is now just a week away. Today, to round off 2016, I would like to take a look back at 
this  year's  economic  developments.  Then,  from  a  somewhat  longer-term  perspective,  I 
would like to talk about the current phase of the global economy, and close my speech by 
touching on challenges facing Japan's economy, looking ahead to next year. 
 
I. The Global Economy in 2016 
Reviewing 2016, it started off with volatile global financial markets. Specifically, Shanghai 
stock  prices  declined  significantly  at  the  beginning  of  the  year,  reflecting  uncertainties 
regarding developments in the renminbi, and this led to a rapid worsening of investors' risk 
sentiment.  These  developments  in  emerging  economies  brought  about  declines  in  stock 
prices and long-term interest rates in major advanced economies. At the Group of Twenty 
(G-20)  Finance  Ministers  and  Central  Bank  Governors  Meeting  held  in  Shanghai  in  late 
February,  the  member  countries  agreed  to  cooperate  in  addressing  volatility  in  financial 
markets  and  the  heightening  of  uncertainties  in  the  global  economy.  Due  in  part  to  this, 
global financial markets had stabilized temporarily. However, a "risk-off" mode in global 
financial  markets  continued  thereafter  through  autumn,  partly  reflecting  the  United 
Kingdom's  referendum  in  late  June,  in  which  the  majority  voted  to  leave  the  European 
Union (EU). On the growth and inflation front, the trend decline in the growth rate -- the 
so-called secular stagnation hypothesis -- and the global decline in inflation rate have been 
hotly  debated.  Many  of  you  may  have  an  impression  that  2016  was  a  year  in  which 
pessimistic views on the global economy prevailed. 
 
However, actual data indicate that the global economy is not as bad as it appears. The pace 
of  growth  in  advanced  economies  has  accelerated  recently,  mainly  led  by  the  solid  U.S. 
economy (Chart 1). There are increasing expectations of acceleration in the U.S. economy's 
growth  rate  going  forward,  reflecting  the  outcome  of  the  presidential  election.  In  fact, 
various economic indicators actually continued to improve steadily even before the election. 
In  emerging  and  commodity-exporting  economies,  the  growth  momentum  is  picking  up, 
 1 
albeit moderately, due in part to the effects of their policy measures. The global economy as 
a whole appears to be turning upward. Let me remind you of the fact that the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), for the first time in a while, did not make downward revisions in its 
World  Economic  Outlook  (WEO)  in  October,  and  that  the  Organisation  for  Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) revised upward its Economic Outlook released last 
month (Chart 2). 
 
From  a  somewhat  longer-term  perspective,  the  global  economy  seems  to  have  finally 
moved out of its adjustment phase after the global financial crisis, often dubbed the Lehman 
shock, and is entering a new phase. In what follows, I will touch on changes underway in 
the global economy while looking back at developments after the global financial crisis. 
 
II. The Global Economy after the Global Financial Crisis 
After  the  global  financial  crisis  started  in  autumn  2008,  the  growth  rate  of  the  global 
economy significantly decelerated. A salient feature of this recession was the deceleration in 
growth  of  the  world  trade  volume,  the  slowdown  in  the  manufacturing  sector,  and  the 
decline  in  business  fixed  investment.  For  example,  the  recent  growth  in  the  world  trade 
volume, calculated by summing up the import volumes of the world's countries, has been 
well below the average growth rate before the global financial crisis (Chart 3). Since the 
global financial crisis, the level of the world trade volume also has deviated substantially 
downward from the trend suggested by the globally-aggregated real GDP. This deceleration 
in  growth  of  the  world  trade  volume  is called "slow  trade,"  which  well characterizes the 
global economy after the global financial crisis. 
 
Economists and policymakers including the Bank's staff are conducting various analyses on 
factors behind the slow trade. Although there is no consensus at present, structural factors 
such  as  the  pause  in  the  expansion  of  the  global  supply  chain  and  the  progress  of 
internalization  in  China  seem  to  have  played  an  important  role,  in  addition  to  a  cyclical 
decline  in  demand.  The  breakdown  by  region  and  item  shows  that  the  decline  was 
conspicuous in emerging economies and capital goods. The downward deviation from the 
trend in real imports was larger in emerging economies than in advanced economies (Chart 
4). Looking at the global real imports by item, the decline in the imports of capital goods is 
 2 
significant. These facts suggest that the deceleration in growth of the world trade volume 
was  largely  driven  by  the  sluggish  demand  in  business  fixed  investment,  mainly  in 
emerging economies. The continued decline in global demand for capital goods has had a 
significant negative impact on the manufacturing sector in Japan, which has a comparative 
advantage in capital goods. 
 
With the slow trade continuing, advanced economies' exports to emerging economies have 
been  sluggish,  leading  to  lower  production  activities  in  the  manufacturing  sector.  As  the 
manufacturing sector tends to play a significant role in leading the business cycle in many 
economies,  its  slowdown  has  weighed  on  the  recovery  in  advanced  economies.  In  this 
situation, the recovery during the past few years in these economies -- the United States and 
Europe in particular -- has been led largely by an acceleration in household expenditures 
amid a lack of momentum in corporate expenditures (Chart 5). 
 
Fortunately, there have been signs of improvement recently. Having been weak since 2015, 
the purchasing managers' index (PMI) -- which represents the overall business conditions in 
the manufacturing sector -- has improved clearly of late in the advanced economies as well 
as  the  emerging  and  commodity-exporting  economies  (Chart  6).  Looking  at  imports  in 
emerging  economies,  those  in the  Chinese and the  ASEAN  economies  bottomed out and 
then picked up. Given that the weakness in emerging economies' imports had accounted for 
the major part of the slow trade, the ongoing recovery in their imports is likely to have a 
positive impact on a wide range of advanced economies' manufacturing sectors. 
 
On the macroeconomic policy front, aggressive monetary easing was introduced mainly in 
advanced economies by employing so-called unconventional measures such as quantitative 
easing  (QE)  --  or  large-scale  purchases  of  assets  including  government  bonds  --  and  the 
negative interest rate policy. With regard to fiscal policy, the G-20 countries provided strong 
fiscal stimulus in a coordinated manner immediately after the start of the global financial 
crisis. Thereafter, some countries -- those in Europe in particular -- conducted fiscal policies 
in a neutral or somewhat contracting manner for a while. This year, with the heightening of 
global  uncertainties,  the G-20  and  the  IMF  agreed  to  take  a  three-pronged  approach  that 
uses all policy tools -- monetary, fiscal, and structural -- individually and collectively, with a 
 3 
view  to  achieving  strong,  sustainable,  balanced,  and  inclusive  growth.  In  fact,  the 
authorities in each economy have been supporting their respective economic growth. 
 
Let me summarize the recent developments in the global economy. The growth momentum 
has  been  picking  up  in  emerging  economies;  in  advanced  economies,  reflecting  this 
development,  the  economic  recovery  that  had  been  led  by  the  household  sector  is  now 
spreading to the corporate sector, including manufacturing. Commodity prices such as crude 
oil  prices  bottomed  out  in  the  first  half  of  the  year  and  turned  to  an  increase  thereafter, 
reflecting the recovery in global demand (Chart 7). The global economy seems to be finally 
entering a new phase, by putting the negative legacy of the global financial crisis behind it, 
although considerable uncertainties lie ahead. 
 
III. Japan's Economy amid the Global Economic Developments 
Now, let me turn to Japan's economy amid the global economic developments that I've just 
explained. The global financial crisis that started in 2008 exerted a considerable impact on 
Japan's  economy.  As  you  all  know,  it  was  triggered  by  concerns  over  the  stability  of 
financial  systems  as  subprime  mortgage-related  losses  spread  in  the  United  States  and 
Europe.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  downturn  in  the  real  economy  in  Japan  was  more 
significant than that at the epicenter of the crisis -- namely, the United States and Europe -- 
although losses at financial institutions were rather limited and the soundness of financial 
systems was well maintained (Chart 8). There seem to have been two factors behind that 
development.  First,  as  I  mentioned  earlier,  manufacturing  --  in  which  Japan  has  a 
competitive  advantage  --  was  stagnant  on  a  global  basis,  as  seen  in  particular  with  the 
decline in demand for capital goods. Second, the yen appreciated in an excessive manner, 
exerting a significant negative impact on Japan's economy, mainly on manufacturing. This 
was because the yen had been perceived as a safe haven currency in the global financial 
markets,  in  addition  to  the  fact  that  there  had  been  little  room  for  further  reduction  in 
interest rates in Japan. 
 
Under these circumstances, Japan's economy was put in an unfavorable situation. The Bank 
responded by lowering the short-term policy interest rate -- which already had declined to 
as  low  as  0.5  percent  --  to  0.1  percent.  In  addition,  it  undertook  new  policy  initiatives 
 4 
including the purchases of risk assets such as CP, which we call "comprehensive monetary 
easing." Despite these efforts, Japan's economy did not get out of deflation, as the Bank was 
not able to provide sufficient monetary stimulus given the limited room for lowering the 
short-term interest rates. 
 
It was against this background that the Bank introduced in April 2013 an unprecedentedly 
large-scale monetary easing, quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE), in order 
to  achieve  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent  at  the  earliest  possible  time.  The  main 
transmission  mechanism  of  QQE  is  lowering  the  real  interest  rates  by  (1)  exerting 
downward  pressure  on  the  interest  rates  across  the  entire  yield  curve  through  massive 
purchases  of  Japanese  government  bonds  (JGBs)  and  (2)  raising  people's  inflation 
expectations  through  the  Bank's  strong  and  clear  commitment.  Thereafter,  the  Bank  has 
pursued  further  monetary  easing  as  appropriate;  it  expanded  QQE  in  October  2014, 
followed by the introduction of the negative interest rate policy in January 2016. Thanks to 
a  series  of  powerful  monetary  stimulus  measures,  Japan's  economy  has  improved 
significantly during a period of more than three and a half years (Chart 9). The excessive 
appreciation  of  the  yen  has  been  fairly  corrected  and  stock  prices  have  increased 
substantially. Corporate profits have marked their historical high levels and business fixed 
investment  has  recovered.  With  regard  to  the  employment  and  income  situation,  the 
unemployment rate has declined to as low as 3 percent, which is virtually full employment, 
and  wages  have  continued  to  rise  moderately.  On  the  price  front,  Japan's  economy  is  no 
longer  in  deflation,  which  is  commonly  defined  as  a  sustained  decline  in  general  prices, 
although there remain the effects on inflation of a significant fall in crude oil prices. 
 
That  being  said,  in  the  first  half  of  2016,  private  consumption  showed  relatively  weak 
developments  in  some  indicators,  mainly  reflecting  the  negative  wealth  effects  stemming 
from  the  decline  in  stock  prices  and  the  deterioration  of  consumer  sentiment.  As  for 
business activity, exports and industrial production remained sluggish, reflecting the effects 
of the slowdown in emerging economies and the yen's appreciation, as well as supply-side 
constraints that were mainly due to the Kumamoto Earthquake. Against this backdrop, the 
momentum of price increases slowed moderately. However, the recent economic indicators 
suggest  that  the  economy  has  been  improving  (Chart  10).  An  increasing  number  of 
 5 
indicators suggest a pick-up in private consumption. For example, the consumption activity 
index (CAI) -- which is calculated by compiling various sales and supply-side statistics -- 
has been increasing steadily in recent months, after showing weakness in the first half of the 
year.  Various  surveys  on  consumer  confidence,  including  the  Economy  Watchers  Survey, 
have been improving. Looking ahead, private consumption is likely to increase moderately 
as the employment and income situation continues to improve steadily. Regarding employee 
income, the labor share in the aggregate output has been on a declining trend in recent years, 
being below the long-term average, with corporate profits staying at high levels. Meanwhile, 
a variety of indicators for the labor market -- such as the unemployment rate, the active job 
openings-to-applicants ratio, and the diffusion index (DI) for employment conditions in the 
Tankan  (Short-Term  Economic  Survey  of  Enterprises  in  Japan)  --  suggest  that  the  labor 
market conditions have tightened. Thus, the conditions for wage increases largely have been 
met.  Wages  are  labor  costs  for  individual  firms.  From  the  macroeconomic  viewpoint, 
however, they are employee income, which is the source of households' purchasing power. 
As  wages  and  employee  income  rise  on  a  sustainable  basis,  private consumption  will  be 
firmer.  With  regard  to  business  activity,  Japan's  exports  and  production  have  increased 
recently, on the back of recovery in demand from emerging economies that I've mentioned. 
By  taking  account  of  these  improvements,  the  Bank  has  made  an  upward  revision  to  its 
assessment of economic conditions at the latest Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) for the 
first time in a while. 
 
In sum, Japan's economy had struggled against the headwinds of the global economy. As the 
global  economy  is  entering  a  new  phase,  Japan's  economy  is  now  able  to  move  further 
forward, supported by the tailwind. 
 
IV. Challenges Facing Japan's Economy: Looking Ahead to 2017 
Lastly, I would like to touch on challenges facing Japan's economy, looking ahead to next 
year.  As  I  have  explained  today,  the  global  economy  is  entering  a  new  phase.  With  the 
tailwind of the global economy, good business opportunities are arising. In this situation, it 
is imperative to get ahead of your rivals both at home and abroad. Fortunately, advanced 
technology, including that related to IoT (Internet of Things),  AI (Artificial Intelligence), 
and big data, will become available for commercial use in a wide range of areas, facilitating 
 6 
new types of products and services.   
 
It is understandable that many people still have pessimistic views on the future of Japan's 
economy from a longer-term perspective after a long period of deflation and low growth. 
However, it is you in business management who can discover new growth opportunities in 
any  situation.  Joseph  A.  Schumpeter,  an  economist  who  emphasized  the  role  of  firms' 
innovation  as  the  fundamental  element  of  economic  growth,  presents  the  following 
statement in his well-known work, The Theory of Economic Development. 
 
[I]nnovations in the economic system do not as a rule take place in such a way that 
first new wants arise spontaneously in consumers and then the productive apparatus 
swings round through their pressure. 
 
It is […] the producer who as a rule initiates economic change, and consumers are 
educated by him if necessary; they are, as it were, taught to want new things….   
 
As  Schumpeter  notes,  I  think  it  is  extremely  important  for  Japan's  economic  growth  that 
firms be innovative in various aspects and create demand for new products and services, 
thereby seizing on consumers' potential needs. 
 
In terms of macroeconomic policy, it is crucial to create a favorable economic environment 
in which firms can make the most of the global tailwind. On the fiscal front, the government 
compiled the Economic Measures for Realizing Investment for the Future in August 2016, 
and it plans to fully implement the measures in the near future. With regard to the structural 
policy, the government is working on various initiatives, such as regulatory and institutional 
reforms to raise Japan's growth potential, including the promotion of working-style reforms 
in  the  labor  market.  These  measures  provide  an  environment  that  promotes  firms' 
innovation and will lead to enhancement of Japan's growth potential in the medium to long 
run. 
 
On  the  monetary  policy  front,  at  the  MPM  in  September,  the  Bank  conducted  a 
comprehensive  assessment  on  monetary  easing  measures 
the 
introduction  of  QQE; based  on  its  findings,  it introduced  a  new policy  framework  called 
"QQE with Yield Curve Control." This new framework consists of two components: yield 
implemented  since 
 7 
curve  control  and  an  inflation-overshooting  commitment.  I  believe  that  it  can  further 
strengthen the effects of the tailwind that pushes up the economy and prices. For example, 
when  the  government  increases  fiscal  expenditure,  the  interest  rates  tend  to  increase, 
thereby  restraining  private-sector  investment.  This  is  the  so-called  crowding-out  effect. 
However, as the Bank contains a rise in short- and long-term interest rates, this effect can be 
avoided. When higher growth and inflation are expected, thanks to efforts by businesses and 
the government's initiatives to strengthen economic growth, keeping interest rates low will 
further  push  up  growth  and  inflation  going  forward.  In  the  current  globalized  financial 
markets, as improvement in the global economy becomes evident, there would be upward 
pressure on long-term interest rates in Japan. In fact, since last month, the long-term interest 
rates  in  the  United  States  have  been  rising  significantly,  having  spillover  effects  on 
long-term interest rates in many other countries. Under these circumstances, 10-year JGB 
yields have been stable at around 0 percent. This shows clearly that the yield curve control 
by the Bank has exerted its intended effects. By implementing this policy framework in an 
appropriate manner, the Bank can take advantage of the recovery momentum of the global 
economy to produce an even greater driving force for Japan's economy. As it encourages 
firms' proactive activities and thereby leads to expectations of higher growth, the driving 
force can be strengthened further in a virtuous cycle. 
 
At the same time, the Bank commits itself to continuing with large-scale monetary easing 
until  the  year-on-year  rate  of  increase  in  the  observed  CPI  exceeds  2  percent  and  stays 
above  that  level  in  a  stable  manner.  This  is  what  we  call  the  inflation-overshooting 
commitment -- the other component of the new policy framework. Thanks to three and a 
half years of monetary easing, Japan's economy is no longer in deflation. I believe most of 
you share the view that the current state of Japan's economy is better than it was four years 
ago; that is, at year-end 2012. Nevertheless, the 2 percent inflation goal, which is the global 
standard,  has  not  been  achieved  yet.  In  order  to  ensure  that  Japan  never  falls  back  into 
deflation, it is necessary to achieve 2 percent inflation in this round of monetary easing.   
 
Some argue that the price stability target of 2 percent is too high considering the current 
situation of Japan's economy.  As  I explained earlier, however, Japan's economy had very 
limited  room  for  monetary  easing  at  the  time  of  the  Lehman  shock,  unlike  the  U.S.  and 
 8 
European  economies,  precisely  because  Japan  was  the  only  country  in  deflation. 
Considering this painful experience, it is essential to secure some room for monetary policy 
responses by achieving the global standard of about 2 percent inflation and thereby raising 
the interest rate that is neutral to the economy. In fact, among central banks and academic 
economists outside of Japan, it is hotly debated whether 2 percent inflation is sufficient to 
secure room for policy responses, and some even argue that the target should be raised to 3 
or 4 percent. This episode shows that the risk of falling into deflation and thereby losing the 
effectiveness  of  monetary  policy  is  widely  recognized  given  the experiences  in Japan,  as 
well  as  those  in  other  economies  after  the  global  financial  crisis.  In  relation  to  this,  it is 
argued  in  Japan  that  the  Bank  should  aim  at  a  lower  inflation  rate,  instead  of  the  global 
standard of 2 percent, as Japan's potential growth rate is lower than that of other economies. 
However,  I  believe  that  the  logic  should  work  in  the  opposite  direction.  In  theory,  the 
interest rate that is neutral to economic activity is the sum of the potential growth rate and 
medium-  to  long-term  inflation  rate.  In  order  to  secure  room  for  monetary  easing,  a  low 
potential growth rate should be the reason for aiming at a higher inflation rate. It can never 
be the reason for being satisfied with a lower inflation rate. The lower the potential growth 
rate, the greater the risk of falling into deflation, necessitating a larger buffer for monetary 
policy. Let me reiterate that the Bank's 2 percent target is the global standard and that the 
inflation-overshooting commitment is designed to clarify the Bank's stance that it certainly 
will achieve this target. 
 
2016 has been a tough year, both for businesses and the Bank. Fortunately, the headwind is 
turning  into  a  tailwind.  I  am  convinced  that  the  coming  new  year  will  be  one  in  which 
Japan's economy will take a big step forward toward overcoming deflation. I would like to 
close by expressing my hope that your business initiatives will  make this happen. Thank 
you very much for your attention.
