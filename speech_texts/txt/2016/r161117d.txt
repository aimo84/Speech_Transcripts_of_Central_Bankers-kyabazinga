Chamber of Deputies  (Budget, Treasury and Planning) and of the 
Senate of the Republic (Budget)
Preliminary hearing on the 
2016 Update of the 
Economic and Financial Document
Testimony of the Deputy Director General of the Bank of Italy
Luigi Federico Signorini
Chamber of Deputies
Rome, 3 October 2016
Mr President, Honourable Members of Parliament,  
I  wish  to  thank  the  Fifth  Committees  of  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  and  of  the  Italian 
Senate  for  inviting  the  Bank  of  Italy  to  give  testimony  on  the  2016  Update  of  the 
Economic  and  Financial  Document.  Given  the  brief  time  that  has  elapsed  since  its 
publication, I will focus mainly on the macroeconomic outlook and on developments in 
the public finances this year;  I will then make some preliminary remarks on the finance 
plans and outlook for the next few years.   
 1.  The macroeconomic outlook  
The  Italian  and  euro-area  economies  continue  to  benefit  from  today’s  extremely 
accommodative  monetary  and  financial  conditions.  The  outcome  of  the  UK  referendum 
initially triggered considerable fluctuations on the international markets, which subsequently 
eased; a few months on, the effects on the markets have proven limited, in part thanks to the 
action  of  monetary  authorities.  Uncertainty  persists,  however,  about  the  longer-term 
implications of the UK’s decision to rescind its membership of the European Union. World 
trade growth has been slower than expected.   
In the euro area the recovery is proceeding but at a slower pace than a few months ago.  
Consumer price inflation is inching upwards, but core inflation has yet to record the robust 
growth required to bring it closer to the inflation objective.   
According to the ECB staff macroeconomic projections released on 8 September, euro-area real GDP will 
expand by 1.7 per cent this year and by 1.6 per cent in both 2017 and 2018. HICP inflation is projected to 
average 0.2 per cent in 2016, and to rise to 1.2 and 1.6 per cent in 2017 and 2018 respectively. 
In Italy stuttering economic growth in the second quarter – which had not been foreseen at 
the start of the year – reflected stagnant domestic demand. Lower investment in machinery 
and equipment was mostly offset by a further increase in that on transport equipment.   
Since the start of the recovery in 2014, investment in Italy has been more sluggish both in 
comparison to  other euro-area  countries and relative  to what  is generally  the  norm  when 
countries are pulling  out of  a  recession.  Our analyses  and  findings  from  business  surveys 
indicate that investment is still being blocked by weak demand expectations and uncertainty 
about future economic trends, geopolitical developments, and the consequences of the UK 
referendum. 
It  is  no  longer  demonstrable  that  credit  availability  poses  a  major  obstacle  to  investment 
decisions;  business  lending  is  not  growing  essentially  as  a  result  of  weak  demand.  The 
differences across categories of firms are significant: trends in loans to firms with more than 
20  employees  and  to  those  in  services  are  positive,  while  in  the  construction  sector  they 
remain  negative.  Interest  rates  on new  business loans  continue  to  fall  and  the  differential 
with respect to the corresponding euro-area average has been all but wiped out. 
In the three months ending in August, lending to the non-financial private sector stagnated on a seasonally 
adjusted basis, while household lending continues to expand (1.4 per cent on an annualized basis); loans to 
non-financial corporations contracted by 1.2 per cent. For new loans to firms the cost of borrowing has come 
down by around 25 basis points from the end of 2015.   
Signs  from  the  labour  market  are  positive  overall.  In  2015,  thanks  in  part  to  the  social 
security  contribution  relief  for  open-ended  hiring  and  the  introduction  of  contracts  with 
rising levels of protection, employment grew more rapidly than trends in output might have 
suggested. In 2016 employment continued to expand; during the year there have been signs 
of  a  slowdown,  possibly  also  in  connection  with  the  retrenchment  of  social  security 
contribution relief.   
Following the hiatus of the second quarter, GDP – on the basis of the information provided 
by the cyclical indicators – could start to increase again in the third, albeit at a very slow pace.   
In July industrial output rose by 0.4 per cent, returning to the average levels recorded in the second quarter. In 
September business confidence was bolstered across all sectors of economic activity, also thanks to the more 
favorable  assessments  on  order  books.  Household  confidence  is  still  relatively  robust,  but  below  the  levels 
recorded at the end of 2015. According to September’s Survey on Inflation and Growth Expectations, firms 
expect to increase investment expenditure overall in the second half of 2016.    
The macroeconomic outlook in the Update of the Economic and Financial Document is less 
favourable compared to that of April. According to the current legislation scenario, GDP in 
Italy will increase by 0.8 per cent this year (as against 1.2 per cent forecast in the spring) and 
slow  slightly  in  the  next  (to  0.6  per  cent,  compared  with  1.2  per  cent).  The  downward 
revision reflects the deterioration of the international context and, in particular, the further 
weakening of world trade and the rise in oil prices, whose effects on exports and production 
activities in Italy appear to have been compounded by the appreciation of the exchange rate. 
The rate of inflation, obtained using the consumption deflator, is expected to reach 0.1 per 
cent and to rise to 1.7 per cent in 2017. 
The current legislation scenario for the two years 2016-17 is largely in line with the estimates 
available  today.  Among  the  recent  assessments  by  leading  private  and  institutional 
forecasters, the Government’s estimate for growth in 2017 is at the lower end of the scale; 
however, generally speaking the other forecasts discount the negative effects of the increase 
in indirect taxes envisaged under the EU’s ‘safeguard clauses’, which instead are taken into 
account in the Government’s unchanged legislation scenario. 
4 
Following the publication in August of the GDP data in the second quarter, the main forecasters revised their 
growth forecasts significantly downward for 2017 as well. According to both the OECD’s Interim Economic 
Outlook released in September and the average assessments of the analysts polled by Consensus Economics in 
the same month, output will grow by 0.8 per cent in Italy both this year and the next. A less favourable 
outlook was depicted last 15 September by Confindustria’s Centre for Studies, which estimated an increase of 
0.7 per cent this year, slowing to 0.5 per cent in 2017. 
Compared with the current legislation scenario, the Government’s policy scenario predicts 
sharply  higher  growth  for  next  year  (0.4  points)  and  lower  inflation  (0.8  points).  The 
difference  is  owing  to  the  cancellation  of  the  VAT  hike  envisaged  under  the  safeguard 
clauses coupled with other interventions the Government intends to make in its next budget 
law. These include public investment in infrastructure, tax incentives for firms that invest, 
and income support for pensioners. 
Overall, compared to the current legislation scenario the measures planned for 2017 entail an 
increase  in  net  borrowing  amounting  to  almost  half  a  percentage  point  of  GDP,  and  a 
comparable rise in output. The implicit multiplier in this forecast is high, also in view of the 
normally lagged response of private expenditure to budgetary measures. The Government 
estimates that the absence of any VAT increase will contribute 0.3 percentage points to GDP 
growth in 2017, a rather strong effect when compared to the econometric estimates based on 
past data. The other expansionary measures are expected to provide a further contribution of 
0.3  percentage  points.  Since  much  depends  on  what  intervention  is  taken  and  how  it  is 
implemented, to make any comprehensive assessment it will be necessary to await further 
details;  the  priority  assigned  to  forms  of  investment  support  is  certainly  a  welcome 
development.     
The Government has requested authorization from Parliament to increase the deficit from 
that indicated in the new policy scenario, by up to 0.4 percentage points of output, in order 
to finance greater spending necessitated by exceptional events, in particular to secure Italy’s 
territory and buildings and to manage migration flows. The current policy scenario does not 
take account of the effects on output of these eventual extra expenses.  
For the subsequent two years (2018-19), the GDP growth forecasts in the current legislation 
scenario are unchanged with respect to April’s estimates (1.2 per cent in 2018 and 1.3 per 
cent  in  2019);  the  policy  scenario,  by  contrast,  has  revised  them  downwards,  by  0.2 
percentage points a year. This change likely reflects the nature of the planned interventions 
and, in particular, the remodelling of the expected increases in indirect taxes. 
5 
2.  The public finances in 2016 
Compared to April’s Economic and Financial Document, the Update slightly modifies the 
estimates  for  this  year.  Net  borrowing  is  expected  to  reach  2.4  per  cent  of  GDP,  one 
tenth  of  a  point  more  than  in  the  April  forecast.  The  variation  is  mostly  ascribable  to 
lower growth expectations; running counter to this was the downward revision of capital 
expenditure  and  the  upward  revision  of  direct  taxes.  Although  the  new  estimate  is  less 
favourable, the deficit is nonetheless expected to contract compared with 2015 (from 2.6 
to 2.4 per cent of GDP). 
Available data on the cash balance and revenues are compatible with the Government’s 
estimates for net borrowing. At least in the first seven months of 2016 (compared with 
the year-earlier period and taking account of the effects of the main operations that have 
no  impact  on  net  borrowing  and  of  a  number  of  temporal  asymmetries),  it  can  be 
estimated that the general government borrowing requirement has improved by slightly 
more than what would be consistent with the Government’s estimates of net borrowing 
for this year.     
The Government’s forecasts of greater direct tax revenues in 2016 are in line with the 
trends observed so far in revenues for the State budget. In the first eight months of the 
year, net of lotteries and other gaming receipts, these grew by 4.0 per cent compared 
with the corresponding period of 2015, driven in particular by the solid performance of 
self-assessment tax returns.  
In  the  Update’s  estimates,  primary  expenditure  is  forecast  to  remain  basically  stable, 
compared  to  growth  of  1.8  per  cent  in  nominal  output.  The  ratio  of  taxes  and  social 
security contributions to GDP is expected to fall by 0.7 points of GDP.    
The structural deficit, net of the effects of the business cycle and temporary measures, is 
forecast  instead  to  increase  by  half  a  percentage  point  of  GDP  compared  to  2015, 
reaching 1.2 per cent in the policy scenario.    
In the policy scenario for 2016, the explanation for why net borrowing as a share of GDP falls but the structural 
deficit increases, can be found in the improved cyclical situation compared with 2015. The contraction of around 1 
percentage point in the output gap (measured according to the EU methodology with a time horizon of four years 
underpinning the macroeconomic forecast) reduced the negative cyclical component of the deficit by more than half a 
percentage point of GDP; on the other hand, the cyclically-adjusted primary surplus, reflecting the expansionary 
stance of budgetary policy in 2016, contracted by a similar amount. The further diminution in interest payments 
(0.2 percentage points) enabled net borrowing to fall this year as well.  
The deterioration is greater than that indicated in the EU Council’s Recommendations of 
last  July,  taking  into  account  the  margins  of  flexibility  recognized  mainly  for  structural 
6 
reforms  and  investment.  In  the  Government’s  assessment,  the  deviation  is  ‘not 
significant’ and should accordingly not endanger compliance in 2016 with the preventive 
arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  
According to EU fiscal rules, in 2016 Italy should have cut its structural deficit by 0.5 percentage points of output, 
but in July the Council granted its request for flexibility in order to make structural reforms and public investments, 
totalling 0.75 percentage points of output. The structural deficit can accordingly expand by 0.25 percentage points. 
To this could be added a further degree of flexibility amounting to 0.1 points in connection with expenditure in 
response  to  exceptional  events  in  particular  the  migration  crisis  and  security,  bringing  the  total  deterioration 
permitted to 0.35 points; the relative assessment, however, will not be made by the Commission until the spring of 
2017 on the basis of final outturns. 
Greater  flexibility  has  been  granted  on  condition  that,  when  the  next  Draft  Budgetary 
Plan is assessed, the Commission shall verify the fulfilment of the pledge the Government 
made in the spring to resume the adjustment towards the medium-term objective (budget 
balance in structural terms). 
According  to  April’s  Economic  and  Financial  Document,  in  2016  debt  as  a  share  of 
output  would  begin  to  decline,  albeit  only  slightly  (by  0.3  percentage  points).  In  the 
updated estimates the inversion in the trend has been postponed until next year. In 2016 
the ratio of debt to GDP is expected to grow by 0.5 percentage points, reaching 132.8 per 
cent.   
Half  of  the  revised  estimate  (0.4  percentage  points)  is  ascribable  to  the  effect  of  the 
reduction in the growth forecasts for GDP, which lowers the denominator of the ratio. 
The  remainder  is  mostly  owing  to  privatization  receipts  that  were  lower  than  those 
planned last year and confirmed in April’s Economic and Financial Document (0.1 per 
cent of GDP against 0.5 per cent). In part owing to unfavourable market conditions, in 
recent years the number of privatizations actually carried out has always been lower than 
that originally envisaged. 
Following the recent revisions to GDP and to the nominal value of debt, the ratio of debt to GDP in 2015 came to 
132.3 per cent of GDP, 0.4 percentage points less than the figure published in the spring document.   
 3.   Public finance projections and plans for 2017-19 
I  will  now  comment  on  the  outlook  for  the  public  finances  in  the  next  few  years, 
analysing,  as  is  customary,  first  the  projections  on  a  current  legislation  basis  (baseline 
estimates) and then the plans that take account of the measures the Government intends 
to put into effect in  the next budget law. 
7 
Current legislation projections. – Net borrowing is forecast to decrease gradually in the three 
years 2017-19; at the end of the planning horizon it is expected that the nominal budget 
balance will have been reached. Compared with the forecasts made in the 2016 Economic 
and Financial Document, the estimates in the Update have been revised upwards by 0.2 
percentage points of GDP in 2017 (to 1.6 per cent) and by around 0.4 percentage points 
on  average  for  the  two  years  2018-19.  These  revisions  mainly  reflect  the  slowdown  in 
GDP growth, partially offset by a reduction in interest payments (of about 0.1 percentage 
points of GDP on average over the three years). 
The primary surplus as a percentage of GDP is expected to increase from 1.5 per cent this year to 2.1 per 
cent in 2017, reaching 3.4 per cent at the end of the forecasting horizon, representing a downward revision 
of about 0.4 percentage points per year on average compared with last April’s estimates. Structural net 
borrowing is expected to diminish by 0.6 points in 2017 and to continue to decline in the following two 
years, reaching 0.2 per cent of GDP in 2019 (against a surplus of 0.1 percentage points as estimated in 
April’s Economic and Financial Document). 
In the current legislation scenario, general government debt will begin to diminish next 
year; in the following two years the decline will be more pronounced; at the end of the 
forecasting horizon public debt will reach 126.1 per cent of GDP. The fall in the debt to 
GDP  ratio  in  the  three  years  2017-19  is  now  expected  to  be  two  percentage  points 
smaller  than  in  April’s  Economic  and  Financial  Document,  which  forecast  that  the 
reduction would have already begun this year.  
Plans and measures. – The fiscal stance, measured by the change in the cyclically-adjusted 
primary surplus, is basically unchanged from that planned in April; also in this instance 
the  changes  in  the  objectives  are  therefore  mostly  ascribable  to  the  worsening  of  the 
economic situation since April. Fiscal policy is expected to remain expansionary in 2017 
and become slightly more restrictive in the following two years. 
The cyclically-adjusted primary surplus is expected to decline from 2.9 per cent of GDP in 2016 to 2.6 
per cent in 2017; in the following two years it should increase steadily, reaching 3.2 per cent of GDP in 
2019.  
Planned net borrowing in 2017 amounts to 2.0 per cent of GDP (against 1.6 per cent in 
the  current  legislation  scenario).  The  structural  balance  is  unchanged  from  the 
previous year. April’s Economic and Financial Document fixed an objective of 1.8 per 
cent for net borrowing in 2017 and an improvement in the structural balance of 0.1 
percentage points. 
Given  the  current  economic  situation  the  Government  believes  it  would  be 
counterproductive to make a structural adjustment in 2017. 
8 
In April’s Economic and Financial Document the estimated output gap for 2017 was negative, at a little 
more than 1 per cent of potential output; in 2018 the output gap was projected to be zero, turning positive 
in  2019  (0.7  percentage  points).  However,  the  Update  –  which  continues  to  utilize  the  European 
Commission’s methodology – estimates an output gap of -1.7 per cent for 2017, which will be reduced in 
2018 and amount to nil in 2019. 
As  already  announced  in  the  last  Economic  and  Financial  Document,  in  2017  the 
Government intends to avoid the indirect tax increases provided for by the 2015 Stability 
Law  and  to  only  partly  offset  the  effects  of  this  decision  with  measures  to  counter  tax 
evasion and elusion together with others to reduce spending. A thorough analysis of the 
effectiveness  of  the  anti-tax  evasion  measures  taken  in  the  past  (for  example  ‘split 
payments’  or  ‘reverse  charges’)  would  enable  prevention  and  counter  measures  to  be 
oriented towards the instruments that have actually proved most effective in practice.  
The safeguard clauses provide for an increase in the VAT rate (and in the excise duties on mineral oils 
starting in 2018) to ensure higher revenues of €15.1 billion in 2017 and €19.6 billion starting in the 
following year. The Government has also announced further measures for 2017, mainly in the field of 
social security and support for public and private investment; these will be detailed in the draft budget law 
due to be presented to Parliament by 20 October. 
The Update gives no specific indications as to the main areas of intervention of the fiscal policy measures 
for the next three years or the expected financial effects in terms of revenue and expenditure. 
As  I  mentioned  in  reference  to  the  macroeconomic  scenario,  the  Government  is  also 
asking  Parliament  for  authorization  to  increase,  if  necessary,  net  borrowing  by  up  to  a 
maximum of 0.4 percentage points of GDP in 2017 (€7.7 billion). The request specifies 
that any increase in the deficit would reflect spending necessitated by exceptional events, 
in particular to secure Italy’s territory and buildings and to manage migration flows. The 
policy scenario does not take account of the effects of these potential outlays. 
Net borrowing is forecast to fall to 1.2 per cent of GDP in 2018 and to 0.2 per cent in 
2019. In terms of the structural deficit, the adjustment would begin again in 2018 and a 
broadly balanced budget (the medium-term objective for Italy) would be achieved in 2019, 
as already forecast in April’s Economic and Financial Document.   
The debt to GDP ratio should begin to fall in 2017; at the end of the forecasting horizon 
(2019) the reduction would be about half a percentage point lower than that indicated in 
the current legislation scenario. One contribution to this reduction is expected to come 
from  privatizations,  whose  objectives  for  the  three  years  2017-19  are  the  same  as  in 
April’s Economic and Financial Document (0.5 per cent of GDP in each of the two years 
2017-18  and  0.3  per  cent  in  2019).  Over  the  three  years,  the  debt  to  GDP  ratio  is 
expected  to  decline  at  a  slower  pace  than  planned  in  the  spring  (by  6.2  instead  of  8.6 
percentage points), mainly owing to the smaller-than-expected growth in nominal GDP.  
9 
As  indicated  in  the  Update  and  in  April’s  Economic  and  Financial  Document,  the 
numerical criterion of the debt rule will not be met either this year or the next. In April, 
the  distance  from  the  benchmark  provided  for  in  the  debt  rule  was  shorter;  on  that 
occasion,  the  Government  had  explicitly  recalled  the  relevant  factors  –  such  as  low 
inflation – which suggested that there would be no violation of the rule, despite the failure 
to reach the benchmark.  
The  Government  considers  that  the  objectives  in  the  Update  are  consistent  with  EU 
rules, also in view of the deterioration of cyclical conditions and the revised estimate of 
the output gap. The European Commission will issue its opinion on this in November, 
when it assesses the Draft Budgetary Plan. 
In May the Commission assessed Italy’s Stability Programme, signalling the risk of a significant deviation 
from the objectives set by European rules and calling for a larger structural adjustment in 2017 in respect 
of what had been planned. The flexibility margins granted by the Commission in 2016 (0.85 percentage 
points of GDP) were conditional on the resumption of consolidation in 2017.  
 
4.   Conclusions 
Mr President, Honourable Members of Parliament, 
Before drawing to a close, I will summarize the  main points I wished to  bring to your 
attention and make some concluding remarks.  
The current legislation macroeconomic scenario for the two years 2016-17 prudently takes 
account  of  the  worsening  of  the  external  situation;  on  the  basis  of  the  information 
available, the scenario as outlined accordingly appears tenable.     
The  available  data  on  the  general  government  cash  balance  are  consistent  with  the 
Government’s estimate of the deficit for 2016.  
The policy scenario for 2017 projects that GDP growth will be significantly stronger than 
in the baseline scenario. The objective is an ambitious one. The forecast is based on a mix 
of budgetary provisions about which the Update does not go into detail. To achieve the 
desired results, the next budget law will have to be drawn up with great care.  
Turning to the measures to support growth, it would be a good idea to focus attention on 
those that could encourage a rapid recovery of both private and public investment. For 
the latter, in particular, not only must resources be allocated but safeguards also put in 
place  to  ensure  their  efficient  and  prompt  utilization.  The  recessionary  effects  of  the 
10 
necessary funding could be limited by pinpointing any waste that can be eliminated and by 
keeping down general government running costs. 
If  the  outturn  data  confirm  the  forecasts,  the  ratio  of  current  primary  expenditure  to 
GDP will decline slightly in 2016 as well, continuing the trend of the last two years (data 
adjusted for the tax credits for employees with medium-low incomes). I believe that the 
reduction  in  primary  spending  is  an  important  result;  indeed  it  is  essential  that  this 
objective be pursued with increasing determination, if the public finances are to be kept 
under control without having to rely solely on today’s exceptionally low interest rates and 
without  squeezing  investment,  whose  recovery  is  essential  for  growth.  The  more  the 
efforts  made  to  limit  outlays  in  recent  years  are  systematic  and  built  into  an  in-depth 
spending review, the greater, more robust and longer-lasting the results will be.  
The  Italian  economy  is  benefiting  from  the  euro-area’s  exceptionally  expansionary 
monetary policy. This is no reason not to act, quite the contrary: other economic policies 
can and must exploit the space this creates. Lower interest payments allow us to begin to 
reduce the public debt without slowing the economy – essential for a country like Italy, 
which has such a large accumulated public debt. Cyclical stimulus enables the short-term 
costs  of  structural  reforms  to  be  lowered,  creating  the  conditions  to  accelerate  their 
implementation and  making it easier to revive and complete them.  
Reducing  Italy’s  debt  burden  remains  a  strategic  objective.  Undoubtedly  one  of  the 
reasons that this did not start to happen this year was the poor performance of GDP and 
the  difficulties  in  concluding,  in  adverse  market  conditions,  the  privatizations  originally 
envisaged. Certainly, market conditions are important in deciding which privatizations to 
carry out and when. If, on the one hand, it is better to make cautious predictions about 
how  much  can  actually  be  privatized  year  by  year,  on  the  other,  by  making  clear, 
ambitious strategic choices, it will be possible to act swiftly and for significant amounts 
when  market  conditions  so  permit.  An  appropriate  privatization  strategy  should  more 
than help to reduce the debt: flanked by the proper rules and controls, it must also aim to 
raise efficiency.
