Jean-Pierre Roth: Heading for more sustained growth? 
Summary  of  an  address  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Swiss 
National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the 
General Meeting of the Swiss Italian Chamber of Commerce, Zurich, 20 June 2006. 
The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bankâ€™s website (www.snb.ch). 
 Lately, Switzerland has been experiencing an encouraging upturn in the economy on the back of 
growth in the international economy. This development is particularly welcome because it follows a 
number of years of economic listlessness which have prompted repeated criticism from international 
bodies, due to the lack of growth in the Swiss economy.  
However, Switzerland's medium and long-term growth problem has not disappeared. Faster economic 
growth is the only possible response to the challenges posed by an ageing population. Moreover, it is 
the sole antidote to Switzerland's continuing loss of ground with respect to the other members of the 
OECD. Reforms are needed to ensure that, in the future, we can achieve more with fewer resources. 
The ways and means of doing this are evident. The Federal Council's package of growth measures is 
a  move  in  the  right  direction,  and  the  current  improvement  in  the  economy  gives  Switzerland  the 
opportunity to move ahead with the requisite reforms.
