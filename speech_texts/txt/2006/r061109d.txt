Rakesh Mohan: State of the Indian economy 
Inaugural address by Dr Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the 2nd 
Annual Indian Securities Infrastructure & Operations Forum 2006, Mumbai, 7 November 2006. 
 It  is  my  great  pleasure  to  be  here  at  the  2nd  Annual  Indian  Securities  Infrastructure  &  Operations 
Forum 2006. The recent growth momentum of the Indian economy is leading to renewed interest in 
India’s growth prospects. As the mid-year review of the annual policy is just over I thought instead of 
giving just a run-down of the current state of the Indian economy let me put the current trends into a 
broader perspective - both with respect to the longer term trend and as well as the global scenario. 
Thus, I will proceed as follows:  
• 
In  order  to  draw  appropriate  perspectives  for  the  future  of  the  Indian  economy,  I  will  first 
present an overview of India’s economic progress over the past three decades.  
Given  the  growing  integration  of  the  Indian economy  with  the  rest  of  the world,  I  will  then 
discuss the prospects of the global economy.  
This will be followed by an assessment of the current economic situation in India.  
Finally,  I  will  discuss  some  of  the  issues  necessary  to  accelerate  the  current  growth 
momentum.  
  I.  
Overview of longer-term trends 
Growth, savings and investment 
Following the initiation of structural reforms in the early 1990s, the Indian economy has grown at an 
annual average rate of over 6 per cent per annum. While the 1980s had also witnessed high growth 
(5.8  per  cent  per  annum),  this  growth  was  associated  with  widening  macroeconomic  imbalances  – 
growing  fiscal  deficits,  growing  current  account  deficits,  falling  international  reserves  and  higher 
inflation  –  culminating  in  the  balance  of  payments  crisis  of  1990-91.  In  contrast,  not  only  has  been 
there an acceleration in growth from 5.8 per cent during the 1980s to 6.4 per cent between 1992-93 
and 2005-06, it has also been achieved in an environment of macroeconomic and financial stability, 
despite large exogenous shocks, both internal and external, over this period (Table 1).

More  recently,  real  GDP  growth  has  averaged  more  than  8  per  cent  per  annum  in  the  three-year 
period ended 2005-06. Taking into account the sharp deceleration in population growth over the past 
two decades, per capita real GDP growth has recorded a more impressive increase from 3.4 per cent 
per  annum  during  the  1980s  to  around  6.5  per  cent  per  annum  in  the  recent  three  years. 
Developments in the current year so far suggest that the economy is on course to sustain the recent 
growth momentum in 2006-07.  
The  Indian  economy  is  today  the  world’s  second  fastest  growing  economy  after  China.  In  terms  of 
purchasing power parity (PPP) GDP, India is the world’s fourth largest economy after the US, China 
and Japan. India’s share in world GDP (PPP basis) has increased from 4.3 per cent in 1991 to almost 
6.0 per cent in 2005 (Chart 1).  
 The step-up in the growth rate of the economy has been facilitated by increase in domestic investment 
to over 30 per cent of GDP, financed predominantly by domestic savings. Domestic savings increased 
to over 29 per cent of GDP by 2004-05 after some stagnation in the second half of the 1990s. The 
improvement in overall savings in recent years has particularly benefited from the turnaround in public 
sector savings. After turning negative between 1998-99 and 2002-03 owing to sharp deterioration in 
the savings of Government administration, public sector savings have turned positive again from 2003-
04 onwards, mainly reflecting the ongoing fiscal consolidation. In 2004-05, the public sector savings 
rate was 2.2 per cent, but it was still less than a half of the peak of almost five per cent touched in 
1976-77.  Improvement  in  corporate  profitability  since  2002-03  has  also  contributed  to  increase  in 
domestic  savings  in  the  recent  years.  Household  savings  remain  the  predominant  component  of 
domestic  savings,  contributing  almost  three-fourths  of  overall  domestic  savings  in  2004-05.  For  the 
Indian economy to achieve higher growth on a sustained basis, further improvement in overall savings 
is necessary and, in this context, public sector savings will have to play a significant role (Table 2).

Inflation 
A notable macroeconomic achievement is in regard to inflation, which has seen a significant fall since 
the  mid-1990s  to  an  average  of  around  5  per  cent  per  annum  (from  around  8  per  cent  per  annum 
during the 1970s and 1980s) (Chart 2). The success with inflation management reflects largely pre-
emptive  monetary  policy  actions,  in  turn,  facilitated  by  an  improved  monetary-fiscal  interface.  The 
forces  of  competition  unleashed  by  growing  openness  and  deregulation  of  the  economy  have  also 
helped to contain the increase in domestic prices. Overall, the success with maintaining price stability 
has led to low and stable inflation expectations in the country. As cross-country experience tells us, 
inflation  expectations  play  a  key  role  in  determining  actual  inflation  movements.  The  success  with 
maintaining  price  and  financial  stability  in  India  has  raised  expectations  of  a  structural  shift  in  the 
medium-term  growth  path  of  the  economy.  Although  inflation  in  India  has  indeed  been  significantly 
lower since the mid-1990s compared to the 1970s and 1980s, it needs to be stressed that inflation in 
India still remains higher than that of 2-3 per cent prevailing in major advanced economies.  
It is interesting to note that inflation in the country in the recent past has remained relatively benign 
despite large shocks from record high oil and other commodity prices. The Indian experience in this 
context  is  consistent  with  the  recent  experience  in  other  countries;  in  the  current  episode of  the  oil 
shock, globally, inflation, has remained relatively modest compared to the kind of increase in inflation 
that  took  place  due  to  the  previous  oil  shocks.  This  is  attributable  to  a  number  of  factors  such  as 
declining intensity of oil usage, incomplete pass-through in some cases, higher competition and finally 
 BIS Review 106/2006

stable  inflation  expectations  in  view  of  pre-emptive  monetary  policy  tightening.  These  issues  are 
explored further in the next section. 
Industrial growth 
A welcome feature of the strengthening of economic activity since 2003-04 has been the resurgence 
of manufacturing activity in the country (Charts 3 and 4). After recording high growth in the mid-1990s, 
the manufacturing sector exhibited stagnation till 2001-02. Since then, manufacturing has registered a 
gradual  pick-up  and  this  growth has  been  sustained  in  the  current  year  so  far.  Notwithstanding  the 
rebound in manufacturing activity, employment growth in manufacturing activity remains low (Table 3).

What 
and 
Happened,
Growth in bank credit 
The upturn in economic activity is mirrored in the sustained growth in demand for bank credit. Bank 
credit has increased sharply from 30 per cent of GDP at end-March 2000 to 48 per cent by end-March 
2006  (Chart  5).  Non-food  credit  extended  by  scheduled  commercial  banks  (SCBs)  recorded  an 
average annual growth of 26.1 per cent between 2002-03 and 2005-06, notably higher than that of 
14.5 per cent recorded during the preceding four-year period (1998-99 to 2001-02) as well as the long-
run  average  of  17.8  per  cent  (1970-2006).  The  stagnation  in  credit  flow  observed  during  the  late 
1990s, in retrospect, was partly caused by reduction in demand on account of increase in real interest 
rates, turn down in the business cycle, and the significant business restructuring that occurred during 
that period. Apart from the revival of economic activity, the sharp growth in bank credit in the recent 
years  can  be  attributed  to  factors  such  as  financial  deepening  from  a  low  base,  structural  shifts  in 
supply elasticities, rising efficiency of credit markets and policy initiatives to improve flow of credit to 
sectors like the agriculture and small scale units. Increasingly, retail credit led by demand for housing 
as well as other retail loans is emerging as a major driver of growth in bank credit. This is reflected in 
the sharp increase in the share of housing credit in overall credit extended by SCBs from 2.4 per cent 
at end-March 1990 to 11.0 per cent at end-March 2005. Growth in retail credit has also emanated from 
increased  use  of  credit  cards,  loans  for  consumer  durables  and  demand  for  education  loans.  The 
share of non-housing retail credit in total bank credit has increased from four per cent at end-March 
1990 to around 11 per cent at end-March 2005. Thus, the share of total retail credit in bank credit has 
increased from 6.4 per cent to over 22 per cent in the past 15 years (Chart 6). As a result of these 
trends, the share of industry in total credit has been falling since the late 1990s (Chart 7).

     External sector 
The external sector has witnessed dramatic transformation over the past 15 years. There is growing 
integration  of  the  Indian  economy  with  the  rest  of  the  world.  In  contrast  to  the  constant  stress 
experienced with respect to the external sector during the period till the early 1990s, the balance of 
6 
 BIS Review 106/2006
payments position since then has remained comfortable. A summary indicator of the strength of the 
external sector is provided by India’s foreign currency assets which are now close to US $ 160 billion 
(as  on  October  27,  2006)  in  contrast  to  a  mere  US  $  1  billion  in  June  1991.  This  significant 
improvement  can  be attributed  to  the combination of  policies related  to  the external sector  such  as 
reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers, current account convertibility, prudential approach to capital 
account  liberalisation,  preference  for  foreign  investment  flows,  especially  direct  investment  flows, 
constraints  imposed  on  debt  flows  and  a  market-determined  exchange  rate  system.  These  policies 
have enhanced access to external markets while promoting productivity gains and ensuring financial 
stability.  This  is  mirrored  in  strong  growth  in  merchandise  exports  and,  more  strikingly,  growth  in 
exports of services and remittances. As a result, the country has been able to finance its increasing 
import demand while keeping current account deficits quite modest – an average of only 0.5 per cent 
of GDP since 1991-92 as against a deficit of 1.8 per cent of GDP during the 1980s (Charts 8 and 9).  
  The  growth  in  services  receipts  has  been  led  by  the  significant  expansion  in  software  exports,  and 
other professional and business services. Reflecting the sustained growth since the early 1990s, gross 
invisible receipts (i.e., services, transfers and income taken together) have expanded sharply from 2.4 
per cent of GDP in 1990-91 to 11.5 per cent in 2005-06, outpacing the growth in merchandise exports 
(which increased from 5.8 per cent of GDP to 13.1 per cent over the same period). This has led to a 
rise in the share of invisibles in the current receipts (exports and invisibles combined) from 29 per cent 
in 1990-91 to 47 per cent in 2005-06 (Table 4). As a result, the ratio of current receipts to GDP has 
nearly  trebled  from  8.2  per  cent  in  1990-91  to  24.5  per  cent  in  2005-06.  Reflecting  the  continued 
buoyancy of India’s services exports, the share of India’s services exports in world exports has trebled 
in the course of just a decade - from 0.6 per cent in 1995 to 1.8 per cent in 2004 (Chart 10). India was 
BIS Review 106/2006

the 18th largest service exporter in the world in 2004. The gains recorded by the exports of services 
have far exceeded those recorded by exports of goods.

 Foreign investment has increased from negligible levels till the early 1990s to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 
2005-06  (Chart  11).  Both  direct  and  portfolio  investment  flows  have  recorded  significant  increases, 
although  the  inflows  under  direct  investment  remain  relatively  low  compared  to  other  recipient 
countries. The volume of FDI inflows into India is, however, growing on the back of growing interest by 
many  of  the  world’s  leading  multinationals.  India  has  improved  its  rank  from  fifteenth  (in  2002)  to 
become the second most likely FDI destination after China in 2005. Net capital flows received by India 
amounted to US $ 25 billion in 2005-06; gross capital inflows and outflows were much higher at US $ 
139 billion and US $ 115 billion, respectively, pointing towards growing openness and integration of 
the Indian economy with the global economy. Consequently, global economic developments are likely 
to have more pronounced effects on the Indian economy than hitherto. Policies that take advantage of 
 8 
 BIS Review 106/2006
the  growing  openness  while  minimising  the  adverse  consequences  have  been  followed  since  early 
1990s  and  these  have  served  the  country  well  so  far.  Indeed,  not  only  is  India  a  recipient  of  FDI 
inflows,  but  Indian  companies  are  also  increasingly  investing  abroad  to  take  advantage  of 
opportunities available in the global market. Outward FDI investment was as high as US $ 2.7 billion in 
2005-06 and cumulative FDI investment abroad is estimated at US $ 12 billion at end-March 2006.  
 Public finance 
Public finances have exhibited a mixed trend in the reforms period. After witnessing some correction 
till 1996-97, public finances witnessed a deterioration, reflecting a variety of factors such as the decline 
in tax revenues (as per cent to GDP) in consonance with the cyclical downturn of economic activity, as 
well as the effects of the 5th Pay Commission award. Indeed, the combined fiscal deficit of the Centre 
and  States  was  higher  in  2001-02  than  that  in  1990-91  (Chart  12).  Since  2002-03  onwards,  public 
finances have witnessed a significant improvement, reflecting both policy efforts at fiscal consolidation 
as well as the upturn in economic activity. Notwithstanding this recent correction, combined public debt 
remains high (almost 79 per cent of GDP). Furthermore, capital expenditure remains low (Table 5) and 
the tax-GDP ratio, despite recent improvement, also remains low (Table 6 and Chart 13).

  Financial sector 
The  financial  system  in  India,  through  a  measured,  gradual,  cautious,  and  steady  process,  has 
undergone  substantial  transformation.  It  has  been  transformed  into  a  reasonably  sophisticated, 
diverse  and  resilient  system  through  well-sequenced  and  coordinated  policy  measures  aimed  at 
making the Indian financial sector more competitive, efficient, and stable. It is noteworthy that despite 
a series of exogenous shocks such as the Asian crisis, sanctions due to nuclear explosions, the sharp 
rise  in  oil  prices  to  record  highs,  large  corrections  in  stock  markets,  financial  stability  has  been 
maintained. The asset quality of the banking sector has recorded a significant improvement: the ratio 
of net non-performing assets to net advances has declined from 8.1 per cent at end-March 1997 to 2.0 
per cent at end-March 2006 despite tightening of prudential norms. There is growing competition in the 
banking sector, as indicated by the rising share of private sector banks in total banking assets. The 
overall capital adequacy ratio of the banking sector as a whole has increased from 10.4 per at end-
March 1997 to 12.8 per cent at end-March 2006. Operating expenses of scheduled commercial banks 
have  declined  from  2.1  per  cent  of  total  assets  in  1992  to  1.8  per  cent  in  2004  indicative  of 
improvements in efficiency. Intermediation cost of banks has declined from 2.9 per cent in 1995-96 to 
2.1 per cent by 2005-06. The financial system is now robust and resilient, and is enabling accelerated 
economic growth in an environment of stability (Charts 14-17).

  World economic situation  
II.  
As noted earlier, the openness of the Indian economy has nearly trebled between 1990-91 and 2005-
06.  The  Indian  economy  is  thus  now  much  more  intertwined  with  the  global  economy.  In  order  to 
assess  the  prospects  for  the  domestic  economy,  it  would,  therefore,  be  relevant  to  review  the 
prospects of the global economy.  
According to the latest assessment of the IMF in its World Economic Outlook (September 2006), the 
global economy (using exchange rates based on purchasing power parities) is expected to record an 
accelerated growth of 5.1 per cent in 2006, higher than that of 4.9 per cent in 2005. This is the fourth 
successive  year  of  strong,  above  trend,  growth  despite  continuous  headwinds  form  record  high  oil 
prices  and  elevated  non-commodity  prices.  Global  growth  is  expected  to  average  4.9  per  cent  per 
annum between 2003 and 2006, significantly higher than growth of 3.9 per cent registered between 
1996 and 2000 and 2.8 per cent between 1991 and 1995. Headwinds from higher commodity prices 
have been offset by productivity gains across the world, in both developed and emerging economies, 
emanating  from  forces  of  globalisation,  the  ICT  revolution,  creation  of  global  supply  chains,  greater 
efficiency in financial markets and better macroeconomic policies. Global growth has been led by the 
US and emerging economies led by China and India. A positive feature is that global economic activity 
is  now  becoming  more  balanced,  with  the  euro  area  gaining  momentum,  along  with  sustained 
expansion in Japan. Economic activity in the US, on the other hand, is slowing down mainly on the 
back of a cooling housing market. Global economic growth is expected to maintain its recent above-
trend growth in 2007; the IMF projects growth to be 4.9 per cent in 2007 (in PPP terms) (Charts 18 
and  19).  Concomitantly,  growth  in  world  trade  has  remained  buoyant.  World  trade  in  goods  and 
services in volume terms has increased by an average of 9 per cent per annum during 2004 and 2005 
and is expected to grow by another 9 per cent in 2006.  
BIS Review 106/2006 
 13
   While  global  growth  has  remained  strong,  it  faces  a  number  of  downside  risks.  One  such  risk 
emanates  from  high  oil  prices  and  commodity  inflation.  Globally,  inflation  has  edged  up  reflecting 
higher  oil  and  other  commodity  prices,  but  surprisingly,  the  impact  has  remained  relatively  muted 
compared to previous oil shocks. It is also worth stressing that since 2003 onwards, real interest rates 
are  at  very  low  levels  in  many  countries  and  monetary  and  credit  aggregates  have  been  recording 
above  trend  growth.  Yet,  consumer  price  inflation  has  been  relatively  benign,  even  in  the  face  of 
sharply higher oil and other commodity prices (Charts 20 and 21). This phenomenon has been aptly 
described as the "Great Liquidity Expansion Puzzle".  
14 
 BIS Review 106/2006
   A number of factors explain as to why consumer price inflation has remained relatively modest despite 
higher  oil  and  other  commodity  prices  and  abundant  liquidity.  Lower  trade  barriers,  increased 
deregulation, innovation and competition and efficiency gains arising from global supply chains all over 
the world helped in containing inflationary pressures. With the rapid expansion in tradables, domestic 
economies  are,  therefore,  increasingly  exposed  to  the  rigours  of  international  competition  and 
comparative  advantage,  reducing  unwarranted  price  mark-ups.  Productivity  growth  in  a  number  of 
sectors,  partly  due  to  IT  investments  combined  with  restructuring,  has  also  enabled  absorption  of 
higher costs. Fall in intensity of oil usage, and, in case of many emerging market economies, less-
than-complete  pass-through  of  oil  prices  have  also  helped  to  contain  headline  inflation.  Finally, 
changes in the conduct of monetary policy frameworks such as inflation targeting regimes with greater 
focus on price stability and increased central bank credibility have contributed to keeping inflationary 
expectations largely stable and anchored at low levels.  
Nonetheless, the cumulative impact of the past increases in oil and other commodity prices has led to 
headline  inflation  in  many  economies  marginally  exceeding  their  respective  targets.  Central  banks 
have, therefore, been tightening their monetary policies to stabilise inflation expectations, especially 
since  demand  conditions  have  been  strong  and  output  gaps  are  closing  in  most  of  the  economies 
(Chart 22). While the Federal Reserve in the US has paused since end-June 2006 after 17 successive 
hikes  of  25  basis  points  each  between  June  2004  and  June  2006,  it  has  indicated  that  further 
tightening would depend upon the incoming information. The European Central Bank is anticipated to 
continue to tighten further, despite a pause in its latest meeting. Thus, global interest rates, which had 
BIS Review 106/2006 
 15
eased significantly during 2002-2003, are likely to remain relatively higher in the short-term. Although 
in recent weeks, international crude oil prices have eased substantially to below US $ 60 a barrel, they 
still  remain  quite  high  and  furthermore,  the  outlook  remains  uncertain.  Moreover,  although  headline 
inflation in major advanced economies has indeed exhibited significant moderation during September 
2006, core inflation continues to remain firm. 
In brief, globally, both output growth and consumer price inflation are relatively more stable despite a 
series of supply shocks. On the other hand, commodity prices, exchange rates and other asset prices 
have  exhibited  heightened  volatility.  When  inflation  and  interest  rates  are  low,  as  is  the  case  now, 
small changes in inflation expectations or interest rate expectations can lead to repricing of risks which 
can be quite large. In turn, this repricing of risks can lead to elevated volatility in asset prices, as was 
witnessed during May-June 2006.  
 Current economic situation: India  
III.  
Against  this  backdrop  of  external  outlook,  it  would  be  useful  to  have  an  assessment  of  the  Indian 
economy for 2006-07, based on developments during 2006-07 so far. A review of the developments 
suggests that the Indian economy is on its way of achieving growth close to that witnessed during the 
past three years (Table 7).

Agriculture 
Assuming  trend  growth  in  agriculture  under  normal  monsoon  conditions  and  barring  domestic  or 
external shocks, the Reserve Bank in its Annual Policy Statement for 2006-07 (April 2006) placed real 
GDP growth, for policy purposes, in the range of 7.5-8.0 per cent during 2006-07. The Reserve Bank 
reaffirmed its forecast for GDP growth in July 2006 in its First Quarter Review of the Annual Statement 
on Monetary Policy. The Reserve Bank revised upwards its forecast for GDP growth to around 8.0 per 
cent  in  October  2006  in  its  Mid-Term  Review  on  the  back  of  improvement  in  industrial  outlook  and 
expected sustenance of growth momentum in services. Other agencies have also placed their growth 
estimates close to 8 per cent.  
Industry and infrastructure 
Led by manufacturing, the upturn in the industrial sector is entering its fifth year of expansion in 2006-
07. Manufacturing activity has remained stronger than expected in the current fiscal year so far. Based 
on movements in the index of industrial production (IIP), growth in manufacturing activity accelerated 
to 11.8 per cent during April-August 2006 from 9.6 per cent in the corresponding period of 2005. In 
terms  of  use-based  classification,  all  sectors,  excepting  consumer  non-durables  have  exhibited 
acceleration. Notably, growth in capital goods production accelerated to nearly 19 per cent, even on a 
high base, reflective of strong investment activity in the economy (Table 8).

On the other hand, the six infrastructure industries have recorded only modest improvement to 7.3 per 
cent  during  April-September  2006  from  6.1  per  cent  in  the  corresponding  period  of  2005.  This 
improvement  was  helped  by  a  turnaround  in  the  production  of  crude  oil  and  petroleum  refinery 
products – these two sectors had registered negative growth a year ago. Electricity generation, coal, 
and oil production, however, remained subdued (Table 9).

The resilience shown by the industrial sector against the hardening of global oil prices is reflective of 
inherent  strengths  and  capabilities  that  the  industrial  sector  has  built  up  over  the  years  since  the 
initiation of economic reforms in the country. There is evidence of growing competitiveness in respect 
of  sectors  such  as  automobiles  and  pharmaceuticals,  with  potential  to  emerge  as  a  manufacturing 
base for global production. At the same time, in the face of challenges from infrastructural bottlenecks, 
elevated  input  costs  from  higher  oil  and  other  commodity  prices,  likely  imports  from  China  and  the 
possibility  of  emerging  shortages  of  domestic  skilled  labour,  the  domestic  manufacturing  sector  will 
have  to  continuously  improve  its  productivity  and  competitiveness  in  order  to  sustain  the  current 
growth momentum.  
Corporate profitability 
In recent years, a striking feature of the Indian corporate sector is its growing engagement with the 
global  economy.  Apart  from  merchandise  trade  in  goods  and  services,  this  growing  integration  has 
taken the form of large scale cross-border merger and acquisition activities. Thus, not only India is a 
recipient of foreign direct investment, but the corporate sector is also exploring opportunities to invest 
abroad. Following the phased liberalisation in the regime for Indian investments overseas, investments 
in  joint  ventures  (JV)  and  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  (WOS)  abroad  have  emerged  as  important 
avenues for promoting global business by Indian companies. Indian firms are acquiring firms abroad to 
leverage comparative advantage of foreign locations, to acquire appropriate technologies and to have 
a  marketing  and  distribution  base  with  the  ultimate  objective  of  attaining  economies  of  scale  and 
productivity gains. As noted earlier, India’s direct investment overseas amounted to US $ 2.7 billion 
during the year (Chart 23). The value of acquisitions is, however, much higher since these data only 
capture the cross-border remittance of outward FDI from India. The number of Indian companies listed 
on  stock  exchanges  abroad  has  seen  a  consistent  increase.  The  growing  integration  of  the  Indian 
corporate sector is also visible from the trends in their exports and imports. The ratio of merchandise 
exports to sales trebled from 6.2 per cent in 1990-91 to 18.6 per cent by 2004-05 while the ratio of 
imports to sales has increased from 7.9 per cent to 21.6 per cent over the same period (Chart 24).  
18 
 BIS Review 106/2006
   Corporate  profitability  has  recorded  strong  growth  for  over  three  years  now.  Profits  after  tax  of  a 
sample non-financial non-Government companies recorded a growth of more than 40 per cent for 11 
successive  quarters  from  October-December  2002  to  April-June  2005.  Subsequently,  growth  in 
profitability decelerated over the next three quarters of 2005-06 on the back of rising input costs as 
well  as  higher  debt  servicing  costs.  Available  information  for  2006-07  suggests  a  reversal  of  the 
deceleration trend; growth in profits after tax accelerated to 35 per cent during April-June 2006 from 
around 15 per cent in the preceding quarter (Table 10). It is interesting that corporate profitability has 
remained  strong,  despite  sharp  rise  in  input  costs.  Perhaps,  the  strong  profitability  can  be  partly 
attributed  to  productivity  gains.  Looking  ahead,  a  critical  question  is:  how  long  can  corporate 
profitability and productivity continue to exhibit buoyancy?

*: Provisional.  
 
Recovery  in  domestic  stock  markets,  buoyant  corporate  performance  and  business  confidence  all 
suggest that investment climate remains upbeat and this should support economic activity. There has 
been  a  large  increase  in  investment  intentions:  the  value  of  investment  intentions  registered  in 
Industrial Entrepreneurs Memoranda have more than doubled from Rs.1,54,954 crore in 2003-04 to 
Rs. 3,82,743 crore in 2005-06. However, it remains to be seen as to how much of these investments 
fructify?  Issues  of  financing  of  investments  will  also  assume  importance  in  this  context  as  these 
investment intentions move towards fructification. 
Banking developments 
Bank deposits as well as credit have recorded strong growth during the fiscal year 2006-07 indicative 
of strong demand conditions. Bank credit has continued to record year-on-year growth of over 30 per 
cent for more than a year. Bank credit has been largely broad-based, although some of the sectors 
such  as  housing  and  other  retail  and  commercial  real  estate  have  expanded  more  rapidly.  In  this 
context, it would be relevant to note that the credit-GDP ratio in India - notwithstanding the sharp rise 
since 2000 - remains lower than in many Asian economies as well as in advanced economies. Deposit 
growth has accelerated, which could be attributed partly to higher interest rates on time deposits as 
well as extension of tax benefits for deposits above 5-year maturity. Concomitantly, growth in broad 
money (M3), y-o-y, at 19.0 per cent as on October 13, 2006 remains above the indicative trajectory of 
15.0 per cent projected in the Annual Policy Statement (Table 11). By current indications, as the 
Reserve Bank noted in its Mid-Term Review (October 2006), the growth in monetary and credit 
aggregates  is  now expected to  be somewhat  higher  than  the  initial  indicative  projections.  In 
view  of  sustained  demand  for  credit  from  the  commercial  sector,  banks’  continue  to  restrict  their 
incremental investments in Government securities. As a result, the banks’ holdings of SLR securities 
have declined to around 30 per cent as on October 13, 2006 from around 35 per cent a year ago. As 
the  ratio  approaches  the  statutory  minimum  of  25  per  cent,  the  flexibility  available  to  the  banks  by 
switching  their  asset  portfolio  in  favour  of  credit  to  the  commercial  sector  by  restricting  their 
incremental  investments  in  SLR  securities  is,  thus,  getting  progressively  limited.  In  the  context  of 
sustained  high  growth  in  bank  credit,  the  Reserve  Bank  has  raised  risk  weights  and  provisioning 
requirements for sectors witnessing large credit growth. In view of the high credit growth, the Reserve 
Bank  has  also  been  drawing  the  attention  of  banks  to  the  need  to  ensure  asset  quality  in  order  to 
maintain financial stability.

Demand  for  bank  credit  is  likely  to  remain  strong  in  view  of  vast  demands  for  financing  the 
infrastructure  investment,  the  growing  size  of  the  services  sector,  SMEs  and  rural  enterprises.  The 
emphasis  on  financial  inclusion  will  also  lead  to  enhanced  need  for  financial  intermediation.  The 
corporate sector, in the coming years, is, therefore, likely to face greater competition for bank credit as 
the  banks  explore  emerging  avenues  such  as  retail  credit.  The  banking  system  has  to  respond 
adequately to these new challenges, opportunities and risks. Innovative channels for credit delivery for 
serving  these  new  rural  credit  needs,  encompassing  full  supply  chain  financing,  covering  storage, 
warehousing, processing, and transportation from farm to market will have to be found. In view of the 
expected  large  demand  for  bank  credit,  banks  will  have  to  simultaneously  put  in  steps  to  increase 
deposit  mobilisation.  Concomitantly,  it  is  important  to  keep  monetary  growth  consistent  with  the 
requirements of price stability.  
Inflation 
Headline  inflation  during  2006-07  so  far  (5.4  per  cent  as  on  October  21,  2006)  remains  relatively 
contained,  even  as  supply  shocks  from  higher  primary  food  articles  prices  have  got  accentuated. 
Primary articles inflation, year-on-year, has increased to 7.8 per cent on the back of higher prices of 
wheat,  pulses  and  milk.  As  regards  fuel  prices,  its  impact  on  domestic  inflation  has  petered  out  in 
recent weeks on the back of base effects. In this context, the recent decline in international crude oil 
prices,  if  sustained,  is  welcome.  However,  it  needs  to  be  noted  that  the  pass-through  of  higher 
international crude oil prices to domestic prices remains incomplete as LPG and kerosene prices have 
remained  unchanged  since  November  2004  and  April  2002,  respectively.  Manufactured  products 
inflation has also edged higher in recent months, although it remains relatively modest (Charts 25 and 
26). 
BIS Review 106/2006 
 21
   Various measures of consumer price inflation – which has a greater weight on prices of food articles – 
remain higher than that of wholesale price inflation. In order to contain inflationary expectations, the 
Reserve Bank increased the reverse repo rate as well as the repo rate by 25 basis points each in June 
2006 and July 2006. The Reserve Bank increased the repo rate by another 25 basis points to 7.25 per 
cent in its Mid-term Review (October 2006) while leaving the reverse repo rate unchanged at 6.00 per 
cent – there has, thus, been a cumulative increase of 150 basis points in the reverse repo rate and 
125 basis points in the repo rate since the tightening began in October 2004. The monetary measures 
have been supported by fiscal measures such as exempting imports of wheat, pulses and sugar from 
customs duty, reduction in customs duty on palm oils and restriction on exports of pulses. Pressures 
on primary articles prices, low stocks in case of wheat as well as shortfall in global production pose 
continuing challenges for monetary management. Furthermore, as the Mid-Term Review of the Annual 
Policy  Statement  for  2006-07  has  observed,  recent  developments,  in  particular,  the  combination  of 
high growth and consumer inflation coupled with escalating asset prices and tightening infrastructural 
bottlenecks underscore the need to reckon with dangers of potential overheating and the implications 
for  the  timing  and  direction  of  monetary  policy  setting.  While  there  is  no  conclusive  evidence  of 
potential  overheating  in  the  Indian  economy  at  the  current  juncture,  the  criticality  of  monitoring  all 
available indications that point to excess aggregate demand is perhaps more relevant now than ever 
before. 
The cumulative rainfall during the South-West monsoon season (June-September 2006) was close to 
normal; the inter-temporal as well as inter-spatial distribution, however, turned out to be uneven. As a 
result,  kharif  foodgrains  output  for  2006  is  now  anticipated  to  be  almost  four  per  cent  below  that 
22 
 BIS Review 106/2006
achieved in 2005. Looking ahead, the total live water storage in the 76 major reservoirs as on October 
12, 2006 at 90 per cent of the Full Reservoir Level remains higher than that of 81 per cent a year ago 
and portends well for the ensuing rabi crops. However, in a medium-term perspective, the stagnation 
in  domestic  foodgrains  production  in  the  recent  years  has  emerged  as  a  clear  cause  of  concern, 
impinging  both  upon  domestic  demand  as  well  as  domestic  prices.  These  issues  are  addressed  in 
detail in the subsequent section.  
External sector 
Finally, external sector developments indicate continued buoyancy in both merchandise and service 
exports, suggestive of growing competitiveness of Indian manufacturing and services. Oil imports have 
posted large growth so far, reflecting the further hardening of international crude oil prices until mid-
August 2006. The recent easing of international crude oil prices, if sustained, could restrict the growth 
of oil imports going forward. Non-oil imports, on the other hand, have recorded a sharp deceleration, 
which could be partly attributed to imports of gold and silver (which declined by 30 per cent during 
April-June  2006  as  against  an  increase  of  52  per  cent  during  April-June  2005).  Imports  of  capital 
goods  continued  to  record  strong  growth  (38  per  cent  during  April-June  2006).  Capital  flows  have 
remained  strong  led  by  higher  inflows  under  FDI,  NRI  deposits  and  issuances  under  ADRs/GDRs 
even  as  there  were  outflows  by  foreign  institutional  investors  (FIIs).  On  the  whole,  India’s  foreign 
exchange reserves have increased by US $ 14.5 billion in the current fiscal year so far to US $ 166.2 
billion as on October 20, 2006. 
Looking ahead, despite the growing oil import bill, the anticipated current account deficit in 2006-07 is 
manageable,  as  in  the  past,  due  to  the  continuing  underlying  strength  of  merchandise  exports, 
invisibles and capital flows. The balance of payments is, therefore, expected to remain comfortable 
during 2006-07.  
In  brief,  an  assessment  of  the  developments  during  2006-07  so  far  suggests  reinforcement  of  the 
robust economic growth exhibited in recent years. For the current growth momentum to be maintained 
and  to  be  improved  upon,  a  number  of  issues  such  as  agriculture,  infrastructure,  and  fiscal 
consolidation need to be addressed. These are discussed next.  
Issues  
IV.  
Instead of summarising my remarks, let me flag some issues that are going to be rather important in 
the days to come.  
Agriculture 
The agriculture sector in the recent years has been marked by low and volatile growth – real GDP 
growth in the agricultural sector during the first four years of the Tenth Five Year Plan has averaged 
only two per cent per annum as against four per cent envisaged in the Plan period (2002-07). A key 
factor underlying this low and volatile growth is the stagnation in domestic production in the case of 
major crops like wheat, sugar and pulses. Illustratively, the production of wheat after touching a peak 
of 76 million tonnes (mt) in 1999-2000 has since then been range-bound at around 70 mt. Similarly, 
the production of pulses has not been able to exceed the peak of 14.9 mt reached in 1998-99. The 
production  of  pulses  at  13.1  mt  in  2005-06 was  even  lower  than  the  levels achieved  more  than  15 
years  back  (14.3  mt  in  1990-91).  The  stagnation  in  production,  in  turn,  can  be  partly  attributed  to 
stagnancy in investment in the agricultural sector which, at constant (1999-2000) prices, at Rs.43,123 
crore in 2004-05 was even lower than that of Rs.43,473 crore in 1999-2000. As a result, the ratio of 
investment to GDP fell from 2.2 per cent in 1999-2000 to 1.7 per cent in 2004-05 (Chart 27). 
BIS Review 106/2006 
 23
 For the Indian economy to attain growth rates of 8 per cent and above, the stagnation in production of 
major crops and agricultural investment needs to be reversed. First, investment outlays on irrigation 
facilities need to be stepped up along with focus on efficient use of water resources. In this context, 
appropriate pricing of power can be helpful in avoiding the excessive use of ground water. Second, 
given the several risks that farmers face such as future price and monsoon conditions, there is a need 
to put in place proper risk mitigation policies. Third, greater focus on rural infrastructure is required to 
enhance  the  productivity  of  physical  resources,  and  improve  supply  chain  management  and  value 
addition  in  agriculture.  Improvements  in  rural  infrastructure  will  facilitate  food  processing  and  other 
agro-based  industries.  In  this  context,  the  focus  on  rural  infrastructure  development  under  Bharat 
Nirman  is  welcome.  Fourth,  globalisation,  rising  income,  and  urbanisation  call  for  increasing 
diversification and value addition in Indian agriculture. The shifts in consumption pattern warrant a shift 
of land and other resources to crops with higher potential for value addition. Fifth, effective linkages 
of production systems with marketing, agro-processing and other value added activities would play an 
increasingly important role in diversification of agriculture. Sixth,  more focus needs to be placed on 
agricultural research in the coming years as the success so far has been restricted to select crops. 
Finally, the Reserve Bank is intensifying its efforts in revitalising the rural cooperative credit system, 
strengthening regional rural banks, providing incentives to commercial banks for investments in rural 
economy  and  ensuring  an  adequate  and  timely  delivery  of  credit  at  an  appropriate  price.  Higher 
growth and stability in the agricultural sector will also provide a strong demand impetus for the non-
agricultural sector (RBI, Annual Report, 2005-06).  
Infrastructure 
The  sustenance  and  strengthening  of  the  ongoing  manufacturing  resurgence  will  depend  critically 
upon  improvements  in  infrastructure  facilities  in  a  number  of  areas.  Improvements  that  have  taken 
place in infrastructure facilities in areas such as telecommunications, civil aviation, roads and, to some 
extent,  ports  and  railways  would  need  to  be  extended  to  the  power  sector.  Electricity  generation 
continues to be hampered by policy shortcomings, continued excessive transmission and distribution 
losses,  and  collection  of  dues  along  with  emerging  difficulties  in  the  availability  of  coal  and  gas. 
Unreliable supply of power and that too at higher tariffs vis-à-vis other countries such as China can 
have adverse implications for competitiveness of the domestic manufacturing sector.  
Provision  of  urban  infrastructure  facilities  also  needs  greater  attention.  Globally,  cities  have 
consistently  provided  the  environment  for  institutional  and  technological  innovation,  and  acted  as 
engines of economic growth. In this context, it may be noted that, in the last century, India did not face 
an  "urban  explosion"  as  against  rapid  urbanization  across  the  globe.  India’s  level  of  urbanisation 
increased  from  17.6  per  cent  in  1951  to  only  23.7  per  cent  in  1981  and  27.8  per  cent  in  2001. 
Consistent with its low per capita income India ranks among the last thirty in the list of countries listed 
according  to their  urbanisation  levels. Despite  its low  level  of  urbanisation,  India’s  urban  population 
has grown to more than 285 million in 2001, close to 28 per cent of the total population of the country. 
In  the  last  decade  the  overall  increase in  population  has  been  particularly  large  at  about 70  million 
people,  which  is  larger  than  the  urban  population  of  all  countries  except  Brazil,  China,  Indonesia, 
Russia, and the United States. Therefore, even though India’s level of urbanisation continues to be 
24 
 BIS Review 106/2006
low  and  its  urban  population  growth  rate  is  not  among  the  fastest  in  the  world,  the  magnitude  of 
urbanisation in India per se is large. Moreover, most of the growth in urban population has been due to 
the enlargement of existing towns at every level and not significantly due to the addition of new towns. 
This  stable,  rather  static,  situation  has  resulted  in  a  stable  city  primacy  hierarchy,  but  is  also 
accompanied with vast areas of the country still continuing to be devoid of urban settlements of any 
size leading to extremely low levels of urbanisation of 10-15 percent in these regions (Table 12).

Studies show that doubling of city size is associated with large productivity gains of 3-8 per cent, i.e., 
moving from a city of 100,000 inhabitants to one of 10 million is predicted to increase productivity by 
more  than  40  per  cent.  These  benefits  emanate  from  the  proximity  to  product  as  well  as  labour 
markets; proximity provides savings in trade and transport costs on the one hand and the availability of 
skilled labour on the other hand. Economic concentration economises on infrastructure investment that 
would have been larger had it been spread out over a larger part of the country. Thus, the evidence 
suggests 
large  productivity  gains.  Accordingly,  substantial 
improvement  in  the  quality,  governance  and  management  of  urban  infrastructure  in  the  country  is 
essential for India to maintain and accelerate the momentum of economic growth and productivity.

Finally,  substantial  improvements  in  primary  and  secondary  educational  facilities  available  in  the 
country will be necessary to accelerate the current growth momentum as well as to reap the benefits 
of the expected demographic dividend. Moreover, a renewed emphasis on quality higher education is 
necessary in view of the greater concentration of economic activities in the skill-intensive sectors, both 
in the industry and the services. 
Fiscal responsibility 
The  success  in  achieving  fiscal  consolidation,  as  observed  earlier,  has  been  mixed  since  the  early 
1990s.  Against  this  backdrop,  the  progress  on  fiscal  consolidation  in  the  past  three  years  is

heartening. Indeed, the turnaround in public sector savings of 4.2 percentage points – from a negative 
2.0  per cent of  GDP  in  2001-02  to  a  positive  2.2  per  cent  in  2004-05  –  has been  the  predominant 
factor in improvement of overall savings to above 29 per cent and of investment rate to above 30 per 
cent. Fiscal consolidation is expected to improve savings further while also permitting productivity and 
efficiency gains as more resources become available for the private sector.  
The  progress  in  Central  Government  finances  during  the  first  five  months  of  2006-07  (April-August 
2006) indicates that the key deficit indicators, as proportion to budget estimates, were higher than in 
the  corresponding  period  of  2005-06.  The  widening  of  deficits  was  essentially  on  account  of  large 
growth  in  non-Plan  revenue  expenditures  -  higher  interest  payments,  higher  food  and  fertiliser 
subsidies and grants to States - which more than offset the buoyant tax collections under corporation 
tax, income tax and customs duties. The Government has, however, reiterated that the deficit targets 
set under the FRBM would be met with an evening out of revenues and expenditures over the course 
of the year. 
Given the downward rigidity in revenue expenditure and sluggishness in non-tax receipts, the scope 
for deepening fiscal empowerment lies in improving tax revenue. In this context, the reversal of the 
declining trend in gross tax-GDP ratio is welcome. Gross tax/GDP ratio of the Centre after falling to a 
low of 8.2 per cent in 2001-02 has since increased to 11.2 per cent, the highest since 1990-91. This 
increasing trend needs to be maintained through further widening of the tax base and curtailment in 
tax exemptions. Larger deficit reductions in 2007-08 and 2008-09 will be required to meet the FRBM 
targets. As the Reserve Bank in its latest Annual Report has observed, adhering to the FRBM targets 
in respect of fiscal deficit and revenue deficit is critical for macroeconomic, financial, external sector 
and budgetary sustainability. It is essential to eliminate revenue deficit and generate sufficient revenue 
surplus which may be utilised for asset creation without creating liabilities. Any slippage in achieving 
the  FRBM  targets  could  erode  the  gains  achieved  in  the  initial  year  of  the  FRBM.  It  could  also 
generate  a  chain  effect  at  the  State  levels  to  relax  targets  set  out  in  their  fiscal  responsibility 
legislations.  Any  deviation  from  the  FRBM  targets  will  have  both  national  and  international 
repercussions in terms of credibility.  
As in the case of the Centre, the States will also need to focus on fiscal empowerment, i.e., expand 
the scope and size of revenue flows into budget. In particular, augmenting non-tax revenues through 
appropriate user charges and restructuring of State public sector undertakings (PSUs) continues to be 
of  critical  importance.  Higher  user  charges  will,  however,  not  be  feasible  unless  there  is  a  greater 
efficiency in the delivery of the services provided by the States. Therefore, improving delivery of public 
services should be a priority for the State Governments. 
The various measures aimed at improving tax collections are expected to reduce revenue deficits of 
the  Government  sector.  The  combined  revenue  deficit  must  be  brought  to  zero  in  order  to  release 
more resources for investment, both by the public and the private sectors.  
Public services delivery 
Given  the  large  infrastructure  requirements  and  given  the  public  good  nature  of  such  projects,  the 
public  sector  will  always  have  significant  presence  in  the  provision  of  infrastructure.  Thus, 
infrastructural projects such as roads, urban infrastructure (water supply, sewerage, public lighting and 
urban  transportation),  railways  and  ports  and  airports  will  continue  to  need  to  be  funded  by  public 
sector funds, although in some cases there is some scope for private sector in areas such as railways. 
This requires greater focus on improvement in delivery of public services.
