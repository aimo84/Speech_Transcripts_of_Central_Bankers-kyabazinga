Philipp Hildebrand: Swiss monetary policy and financial markets 
Summary of a speech by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National 
Bank, at the Autumn forecast of the Swiss Institute for Business Cycle Research, Zurich, 5 October 
2006. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bankâ€™s website (www.snb.ch) 
 Transparency and communication enhance the impact and the precision of monetary policy. Monetary 
policy  functions  through  expectations.  This  means  that  it  is  first  and  foremost  expectation 
management. Central banks strive for transparency regarding their methods and approaches. All in all, 
the current economic and, in particular, the structural uncertainties are resulting in a greater range of 
possible economic scenarios and thus also in an increase in the range of expectations regarding our 
future  monetary  policy.  In  other  words,  being  transparent  does  not  automatically  mean  being 
predictable.  Therefore,  the  Swiss  National  Bank  (SNB)  considers  it  particularly  important  to 
communicate its monetary policy concept to the markets and the public. This allows them to arrive at 
similar conclusions to those reached by the SNB.
